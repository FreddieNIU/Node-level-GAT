However, you can't just look at an ETF's name and assume anything, since each one is a little different."", ""When it comes to dividend stocks, Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) takes the dividend story an extra step forward, and that could make it the best dividend ETF for you. Here's what you need to know."", ""A lot of dividend-focused exchange-traded funds look just at dividend yield. For example, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD) buys the 80 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 index. It doesn't matter if the stocks are financially strong or weak, or if they have a history of operating at a high level or are industry laggards."", ""That may be fine for some investors, but others may want to be a bit more discerning. That's where Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF comes in."", 'First, the ETF required holdings to have at least 10 years of annual dividend increases behind them. Then it creates a composite score based on cash flow to total debt, return on equity, the dividend yield, and the five-year dividend growth rate. The ETF then ranks stocks from best to worst on its composite score, selecting the top 100 names, weighted by market cap, for inclusion in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF. (Note that real estate investment trusts are specifically removed from consideration for the portfolio.) In effect, the ETF is attempting to find a balance between quality and yield.', ""The unique portfolio construction here has material implications for dividend investors. For starters, it is highly likely that you will be able to find an ETF with a higher yield. As noted, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF's sole focus is on high-yield stocks, and it has a dividend yield of 4.6%. That's more than a percentage point higher than Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF's 3.4% yield. If all you care about is yield, then Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF might not be a good fit for you."", ""However, if you want to own high-quality dividend stocks, your focus shouldn't be on dividend yield alone. You need to consider other factors, which is exactly what Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is designed to do. But a couple of stats will help here."", ""SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF's largest sectors are real estate (26% of assets), financials (20%), and utilities (18%). That's nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in just three sectors. Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF's top sectors are finance (17% of assets), healthcare (15%), consumer staples (13%), industrials (13%), and energy (12%), which together make up roughly 70% of the portfolio. There's a huge diversification difference here, and Schwab's approach puts more of the fund into sectors with a growth orientation."", 'Dividends are great, but focusing only on dividend yield can bias your portfolio in ways that you may not want. Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF tries to find a better approach by bringing yield, dividend growth, and company quality into the mix.', ""There's nothing wrong with buying an ETF that only looks at dividend yield, but you have to be sure that this approach is actually what you want. For many investors, factoring in quality will be a more attractive way to go about investing in dividend stocks. And if that sounds like something you would want, Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF could easily end up being the best dividend ETF for you."", 'Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Alexandria Real Estate Equities in Focus', ""Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.41%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity.

In recent years, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has also shown interest in healthcare, opening dozens of health centers nationwide within its stores. But last week, Walmart announced it's giving up on that strategy."", ""Walgreens investors may be breathing a sigh of relief, knowing that the company won't have to worry about Walmart as a competitor in this arena. However, the strategy change may not be good news for Walgreens."", ""Walmart's recent announcement should raise some red flags for investors."", 'Walmart management had touted healthcare as a promising growth opportunity for the big-box retailer. The retail giant offered low-priced health and dental services that would provide consumers with cost-effective options. It would also give them more of a reason to visit their local Walmart, to not only shop but to also stop in and get a checkup.', 'Up until recently, Walmart promoted optimistic plans for healthcare. A year ago, the plan was to double its footprint and have more than 75 health centers across the U.S. by the end of 2024. Those plans changed dramatically. Walmart said late last month that it would close its 51 health centers by the end of July. It will also shut down its virtual healthcare operations.', 'A company spokesperson explained, ""Healthcare is expensive to run. We were finding that the increased labor and operating costs environment, like with reimbursement, both public and private, made it difficult.""', ""Walmart closing down its health centers may sound like a positive development for Walgreens. After all, no one wants Walmart as a competitor. But the bigger takeaway is that a business with vast, diverse, and complex operations such as Walmart can't find a way to make its healthcare business profitable -- at least, not at a level it's comfortable with. And it's not as if Walmart generates massive margins. While it has reported $15.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months, that was on revenue of $648.1 billion, which equates to a profit margin of just 2.4%."", ""Walmart likely wasn't going into this hoping it would be hugely profitable. By offering low-cost health and dental options, odds are it knew the margins would be slim. And yet the actual numbers came in worse than expected. Labor costs have been rising in recent years and inflation certainly hasn't helped, either. A lot has changed since 2019 when Walmart first announced its ambitions for health centers. But as recently as last year, it was still expecting to launch more health centers."", ""This doesn't bode well for Walgreens. The company has invested billions into primary care operator VillageMD in an effort to open health clinics at its stores. And its aims are far grander than Walmart's; in 2021, it set out a target for 1,000 health clinics by 2027. But that goal looks doubtful with the company recently announcing it will shut down 160 VillageMD locations as it tries to improve profitability. In three of the past four quarters, Walgreens has incurred a net loss."", ""Unlike Walmart, Walgreens hasn't pulled the plug on its healthcare operations. And odds are, it isn't going to. The company cut its dividend this year in an effort to free up resources and strengthen its balance sheet. Last year, it also brought on a new CEO, Tim Wentworth, who has a strong background in healthcare. It doesn't appear Walgreens is doing anything but going all-in on its healthcare venture."", ""But if Walmart can't make it work with its far greater resources to pull from, I'm not optimistic that the pharmacy retailer will fare any better."", ""Walgreens is trying to turn around its stock by strengthening its margins and winning back investors. But with Walmart abandoning its health plans due to a lack of profitability, I'm inclined to be less optimistic that Walgreens can succeed where Walmart can't. While Walgreens may not be as aggressive on price as Walmart, it's still going to be an uphill battle to grow its operations and get out of the red."", ""Expect things to get worse for Walgreens. If the business can't prove it's on the right track and heading toward profitability, then this already struggling stock (it's down 46% in the past 12 months) will go lower. The most prudent option for investors interested in the stork is to wait on the sidelines and see how it progresses.

Indeed, the latest earnings season has been hurricane season for such names. For others, like WMT, the good times keep coming despite the heavy gut punch of inflation, which is acting as less of a headwind than for many other retailers out there.', 'Despite the performance gap across the trio of retailers we’ll cover in this piece, they all have one thing in common: they’re all Strong Buys, according to the analyst community. Therefore, let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to find out which is the best of the batch.', 'Just 2% away from all-time highs, grocery-heavy retail behemoth Walmart seems to be ready to continue its steady ascent again after taking a multi-month breather. Undoubtedly, Walmart isn’t just a firm that’s fortunate enough to have a solid grocery business that offers Great Value (dual meaning here) to customers seeking shelter from the inflationary hurricane.', 'The company is incredibly well-managed and is more tech-savvy than many give it credit for. Walmart’s Q1 earnings are on tap for May 16, and WMT stock may just have what it takes to soar as it moves past a quarterly checkpoint that’s acted as a difficult-to-pass hurdle for other retailers. Perhaps Walmart can stand tall where many others have fallen short. In any case, I remain bullish on WMT stock for the long run.', 'Though only time will tell how Walmart fares going into the big number, I think we’ll see more signs that consumers remain hungry for a bargain. Inflation isn’t over yet. And even when it is, there’s no reversing the past few years’ worth of price increases unless, of course, we have deflation on everyday goods, something Walmart CEO predicted would come last year.', 'Deflation, inflation, or zero inflation, Walmart seems positioned to thrive as it continues winning the love of budget-hit consumers. Additionally, I’m curious as to where the company’s data prowess will take it over the coming years. With advertisers getting the green light to incorporate Walmart shopping data for better ad targeting on Disney (NYSE:DIS) streaming platforms, Walmart seems to have a front-row seat to the future of data analytics.', 'At 31.6 times trailing price-to-earnings, WMT stock is expensive for a grocery retailer, but as a hidden tech-savvy data play, perhaps it’s not.', 'WMT stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 25 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average WMT stock price target\xa0of $66.08 implies 9.3% upside potential.', 'Shares of Five Below, a discount retailer popular with youth, now find themselves more than 36% below all-time highs hit back in the middle of 2021. As one of the bigger laggards so far in 2024, with shares down 33% year-to-date, questions linger as to whether the value proposition is good enough to get consumers to buy in spite of considerable headwinds facing discretionary retail. After all, not everything at Five Below is $5 or under anymore.', 'Indeed, we have inflation to thank for that. Despite basket sales trending lower in recent quarters (the past eight quarters, as pointed out by Matt Boss of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), who recently downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy), I view FIVE stock as a compelling bargain. Aiding the bull case is its long-term expansion potential and the temporary nature of lingering discretionary retail headwinds. As such, I have to stay bullish on FIVE stock, even if it takes a few more quarters of lighter baskets for the tides to turn.', 'It’s not just lighter baskets that’s worked against Five Below, but perhaps items that skip the basket entirely. Undoubtedly, shoplifting has continued to plague a wide range of brick-and-mortar retailers. Earlier this year, Five Below noted that it’s pulling away from self-checkout to curb theft (or shrink, as the industry calls it).', 'Indeed, the shoplifting of such low-price merchandise may not be taken as seriously by police, making it critical for the discount retailer to do its best to shrink, well, shrink, even if at the cost of increased friction at checkout.', 'As Five Below combats shrink while seeking to enhance its value proposition in the face of what remains of inflation, I do see a path higher. Investors will need to be patient for now, but with shares trading at 23.3 times forward P/E, the lowest it’s been in the past year, there’s a lot of incentive to hold.', 'FIVE stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average FIVE stock price target\xa0of $206.43 implies 48.3% upside potential.', 'Shares of yoga wear top dog (or should I say downward dog) Lululemon have continued to sink following the company’s terrible quarterly showing that sent LULU down double-digit percentage points. Just like that, LULU stock wiped out most of its 2023 gains and is now back at late-2020 levels, way back when we were in lockdown.', 'Fans of the brand may find Lululemon to be a bargain here, but after fashion shifts (tights are out, baggy is in), I find it hard to stay bullish on the stock any longer. Due to shifts in fashion trends, which may not reverse anytime soon, I’m inclined to turn bearish on the stock.', 'Lululemon had a good run, and though its Team Canada Olympic kits (yes, Lululemon is a Canadian company) are to be viewed by all on the big stage, I’m unsure if showcasing such fashion will be enough to reverse recent trends. It’s not that Lululemon is too expensive (though that’s one reason to sell the stock in a stagnant economy), but fashion trends are just bound to change. Indeed, Lululemon will probably still be a top apparel play for the yoga studio or even the gym.', 'Beyond that, though, I don’t think we’ll be seeing Lulu leggings all too often at the supermarket, shopping mall, or music festivals anymore. Fashion is hard to predict. And for that reason, I’m holding off on buying LULU stock on the latest dip. At 28.9 times trailing P/E (the lowest it’s traded in the past year), many, including most in the analyst community, view Lululemon as a great buy on the dip.', 'Still, I acknowledge that I could be wrong, and analysts could be right to recommend shares on weakness. There’s a chance Lululemon will be able to overcome temporary fashion shifts and pressures from new rivals. However, I’d much rather wait and see how things play out.', 'LULU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 17 Buys, three Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average LULU stock price target\xa0of $487.81 implies 38.2% upside potential.', 'Retail stocks are not created equally. Some will thrive in the face of headwinds, others will fold, and some will fluctuate wildly. In any case, I view the scene as worth watching or even buying if you seek value in an otherwise “toppy” market. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside to be had (48%) in FIVE stock.', 'Disclosure']"

high yield market, for example, compared to inflation compared to cash yields."", ""And as long as you can avoid the defaults, that's pretty compelling right now, I'm sure."", ""So if I look at the yield on the 10 year here bill, we're at uh back to four or five."", ""What, what's your view of where that heads near intermediate term?"", ""I mean, I think that's very dependent on rate cuts."", 'If, if uh we need tighter financial conditions, that might mean that those yields have to go even higher to get inflation back down to 2%.', 'So on the high yield front, have we seen an uptick in defaults at all or is that something that is a concern as we had throughout the year?', 'I mean, the, the view of the economy and therefore of earnings as well has been pretty sanguine.', 'But some of the more recent data really seems to be rolling over a little bit.', ""Yeah, the economic data has been a little bit softer of late, but earnings are really in a goldilocks scenario for high yield, not too hot, not too cold and defaults are in the 2 to 2.5% range, they've leveled out for the last six months or so."", ""And that's well below historic averages."", 'So, uh the, you know, the, the idea that that there is a lot of stress in the high yield market is just not borne out by the data.', 'What about bill?', 'Just core investment grade fixed income attractive?', ""Uh I think it's tough."", 'I think it, it, you really do need the rate cuts to materialize, to justify that.', ""Otherwise, why come out of cash at 5.3% to go into core fixed income where you're in the mid fours?"", ""And if you're in the aggregate index, you're talking about a duration of six to under yield cash."", ""So I I think that that's still a tough spot to be from here within high yield where do you see the most opportunity right now?"", ""Yeah, I think uh financials in the high yield market, that's um you know, not a big part of the high yield market, but it's uh very attractive facing much less competition from banks as a result of what happened in the spring of 2023."", 'And then cable is getting very interesting.', ""It's been under severe pressure in both the equity market and the high yield bond market."", ""But I think there's some real opportunities being created there."", 'Interesting.', 'All right, thanks, Phil.', 'Thanks for coming into the studio.', 'Good to see you coming up.', 'Life 360 is a location sharing app that allows its users not only to keep track of their loved ones, but also keep track of belongings and access a range of safety services.', ""We're going to

reasons why things aren't worse?"", 'And are there any um levers that you know, can be pulled by the next incoming president to, to help keep that going?', ""Yeah, so it's two things mainly that um improve the outlook for Medicare."", ""Uh The first is that the economy is just doing well and Americans don't believe it."", ""And when we saw new confidence readings today that said Americans think the economy is in bad shape, but it's not."", 'And uh government tax revenues went up by more than expected because the economy grew by more than expected.', 'People are earning money and paying more taxes.', ""So that's number one, the other one people aren't going to believe either, which is that the the rate of price increases in health care have actually moderated uh relative to economist expectations from just a couple of years ago."", ""Um Biden didn't really accomplish either one of those things."", 'I mean, this is the force of the economy on its own.', 'There have been some government efforts going back to the Affordable Care Act in 2010 that have uh intended to lower the growth rate of health care.', 'And you know, for years, health care was growing at two or three

don't, I think people are stupid and I think that the one thing we all have to keep in mind is that a lot of those prices have gone up and stayed up."", 'So the rate of inflation could be zero on a

really become the dividing line between the haves and the have nots."", 'This is playing out across frankly the corporate sector in terms of large versus small cap uh co companies that are strong

bifurcation among consumer spending trends in the last three weeks via earnings season in a way frankly, I have been seen as acute in years."", 'And so if you just look at a handful of examples, whether it be uh restaurant spending and more rotation to food at home, whether it be the divergence between corporate travel with some ex expectations of fed cuts.', ""As we talked about the potential M and A and deal flow versus domestic vacation spend, which was a completely kind of reopening revenge travel, uh tailwind a couple of years ago, you're seeing this bifurcation in terms of the high end, the well capitalized companies and everyone else."", ""And the question has always been, everyone's trying to figure out, is it a hard landing or a soft landing?"", ""The way I'm looking

today's deal is telling us that, you know, under this new management regime which has seen, I think what's transformative here is the relationship that they built with their partners in, in including in the FDA, who are allowing them to have a path, you know, which is very streamlined when it comes to having a variant based vaccine."", ""But I think I'm sure you are interested in also understanding the COVID influenza combination vaccine that uh the regulatory path for the late stage vaccine."", ""Uh There has also been an alignment with the FDA uh on uh that becoming available for

trajectory look like for Nova backs?', 'Yeah, I mean if you if you take a step back on on the size of the market of the opportunity we are talking about.', 'And if you just look at flu and, and take out the pandemic from the picture, you know, we were vaccinating roughly uh north of, you know, 50 to 60 million uh adults every year and a large majority of them were and elderly, right, the vaccination rates tend to be higher on that.', 'So if you think about that market is at least what you would look to protect.', 'And um there is obviously a data, you know, as, as you might, as you guys are aware that Nova was working on a, a flu vaccine before COVID even came along and they had positive phase three results.', ""So what today's uh update and development does is actually bring that back almost from the uh uh ashes to be able to develop as a stand alone vaccine, a flu vaccine."", 'Uh And then uh the combination points up uh vaccine would be in addition to that stand-alone flu vaccine.', ""So again, it's, it's a little unclear how the market would segment out which uh parts of the population would only prefer flu and not uh you know, take a COVID combination."", ""But I think we'll see the guidelines in the medical professional bodies."", ""You know, the recommendations around uh having protection for both and, and if safety and efficacy and importantly, immunogenicity, which we've seen already on a stand alone basis from the COVID vaccine for NOVA and also from the flu vaccine."", ""Uh there's a very high likelihood of success for them to hit on this phase three trial, they're looking to execute and then in terms of the market opportunity uh and especially in a premium segment market or elderly market where it's a little unclear how the MRN A

to comment on activist uh situations, but I think just at the highest level, it, it it was, I think directionally uh pointing to the things that the management was already working on and today's deal actually confirms that, right, like one of the uh uh recommendations or uh you know, ask for the, for the management was to engage in a process or engage with a credible partner that we have in Sanofi that they, you know, they've been working on for several months deals like these don't come together as you know, overnight."", ""So I think that maybe that urgency to act or deliberation was uh you know, catalyzed by having an activist uh uh interfere, but clearly management had been uh you know, we looking at some of these strategic options for a little while and, and as you know, over the past year, they've uh cut cost uh you know, right size the organization and they continue to do that into the, into next year."", 'So um getting that balance sheet uh situ uh you know, uh issue that they had to uh get over was already in the works and, and um and, and execution related issues that were, I think also pointed out uh from regulatory standpoint, from a commercial standpoint.', ""Those were already things they, they were uh you know, on track, on track with and hence, you know, you saw a partner like Sanofi buy into uh their, their strategic operational plan and, and how I, I think

fell a little flat except for the fact that he's delivering on it."", 'We saw them, he set expectations low, he set guidance low and he beat already in the first quarter.', 'And the big problem that everyone was worried about with paypal was margin contraction.', 'We saw an expansion of margins in that first quarter by 98 base points.', 'That was a good deal.', 'Yes.', 'All right.', ""So let's talk about what we've seen happen in the stock here."", 'We re rating perhaps this is, this is a big deal because the stock trades down to 15 times earnings relative to the general S and P at 21 times.', 'So why its historic multiple is about 30 times as margins contracted and growth slowed the multiple contracted.', ""Now, what you're seeing is a re acceleration since Andrew Chris came on board margin expansion."", 'You saw a total payment up 14% last quarter revenues up 9% earnings up 18% total transactions up 11%.', 'So as we get more consistency, a few quarters under his belt where the market can believe that mar margins have stopped going down and revenues continue to grow, earnings continue to grow.', 'Cash flow continues to grow.', 'We could see a multiple expansion on top of the business expansion.', 'So maybe back up to 18 times, 20 times 22 times.', ""I don't know if we're going back to historic multiples because that the Halcyon days of the 30% growth may be behind

is my favorite metric.', ""This is the one that can't be manipulated."", 'They generate about $5 billion a year of free cash flow.', ""It's amazing that I'm talking about a turnaround situation that

that.', ""It's cash generative and that gives them all the runway they need in addition to the $9 billion on their balance sheet of cash."", 'Interesting.', 'All right, we always like to talk about

And we can also say, and, and this is your point number two, the thing that they tried to do to become less dependent on trading profits didn't work out so well."", 'Complete train wreck.', 'So, uh you know, the message is blurry.', 'Uh They tried to do Marcus for many years, they tried to do Apple Card credit card.', 'They tried to get into the credit card business.', ""That's not their bread and butter, what they need perhaps to David Solomon, Ceo, David Solomon's credit."", 'He said he sort of cut their losses in that.', ""He said it wasn't, it didn't work."", ""We're done."", 'Leaders always come to the correct conclusions after, after trying everything else.', 'But leaving that aside, I think the message is getting clearer and they do want to spend more time building out the reoccurring revenue businesses like the asset management, which is a relatively small portion of their overall business to 0.1 every quarter.', 'They got to start from square one.', 'All right.', ""And let's get to the third thing here that we need a rate cut."", 'This is a key.', ""They've got a peerless investment banking franchise M and a debt refinancing ipos."", ""It's just been a little bit anemic with such an aggressive rate hiking cycle over the last year and a half, 2021 was an amazing 2223."", 'Anemic.', ""It's starting to come back in fits and starts, but we're really gonna need to see a cut or two cuts for animal spirits to really kick in the M and a game to get on boards to say I gotta buy that company before someone else does."", ""It's time to refinance all of our debt."", ""It's time to do equity offerings and then for companies that want to go public now is the time animal spirits are back."", ""We're not quite there yet."", 'I think a cut towards the back half of the year and that may take a quarter, quarter and a half.', ""And that's why we're probably a pass on goal for new money at these levels."", 'But on a pullback, we would consider it to have to be meaningful pullback.', 'Got you.', 'Ok.', 'So pull back, we talk about, you know, what could be the upside case here.', 'The other one would be as you mentioned, if there are rate cuts.', 'Yes, and they could come sooner than we expect.', 'We saw the jobless claims yesterday were higher than expected and Chairman Powell was very explicit about that.', ""Yes, we're watching the inflation numbers."", ""He's kind of in the camp that we all are waiting for those owner rents to come down."", ""They've just been stubborn."", 'We all look at Zillow rents and everything else.', ""But he did make an explicit note about the labor market because that's the second part of the mandate."", ""And we're seeing some signs that maybe that softening a little bit, which could give them cover to at least do one cut."", ""You know, the earlier they go, the less they're gonna have to do if they were to go over the summer, which is lower probability, maybe they only have to do one or two."", 'If they wait longer until maybe after the election, it might require more cuts.', 'I love to you snuck in some macro stuff for us, which we love.', 'Thanks so much.', 'All right.', ""So let's sum up what you're telling investors here."", 'Basically, you say by paypal on performance under new leadership, the play on value add margin, real acceleration and healthy generation of free cash on the other side, you said for now, avoid Goldman Sachs a little pricey and so dependent on trading profits.', ""It's playing catch up on asset management and it is waiting for those rate cuts to ignite capital

show, right?', 'And all kinds of companies spending a lot of time, money and effort there maybe start there, Ryan explain to viewers kind of the differences between the two and then how Kaiju is, is really integrating that tech, right?', ""So I think as you say, the, the A I that most people are familiar with this generative A I where you're taking uh a non defined non standard data set."", ""In most cases, the internet uh where your ownership of the data to train the models isn't necessarily well defined."", ""You've got free use versus copyright infringement and you're trying to answer like

hallucination that come with that.', 'I mean, no question.', ""It's a very powerful technology with a bright future predictive A I is using either easily purchased or collected at source data for us,

price action that we want to take advantage of."", ""And we see this over and over again and there's a reasonable amount of certainty and we can use it to to that end."", ""And so basically, it's all, it's not fundamental analysis at all, it is just based on."", ""So it's effectively predictive A I based on technical analysis to some extent, if you wanna share the the secret sauce rii I knew that was coming."", 'Um If you think about it, every positive investment decision results in a transaction, right?', ""It doesn't matter what the asset class is, you know, real estate derivatives, equities options, you know, you do your analysis, whether it's fundamental technical, there's an investment committee and at the end of the day, if it's go ahead, you're going to affect a transaction and we can see the pattern in the transaction, not always but for specific transactions, you can with some degree of certainty."", ""Reverse engineer the investment decision that resulted in the transaction example would be, you know, if you're watching rotation versus distribution they're very different intentions."", ""And so they are very different patterns, panic looks different, you know, buying quietly because there's, you, you have some certainty there's going to be a positive earnings and you don't want to disturb price versus buying indiscriminately because you think in five years the stock is going to be more positive, different patterns, different outcomes."", 'If you can identify them, then you can predate on them.', ""I'm, I'm interested."", ""So, you know, it's interesting, right?"", 'You, you, so you found some tasks where you think?', ""OK, predictive A I in my world, it doesn't make sense."", ""Are there ones where you think, you know what this tech, this tech is not up to that task ones you wouldn't want to see it apply to?"", 'Yeah.', 'Sure.', 'Absolutely.', ""Obviously, anything with a long term time frame, I don't care if it's human or machine, there's no person, there's no system, there's no predictive A I that's going to tell you with any certainty where a stock is going to be in six months from now."", 'And anyone who says different is just trying to sell you something.', ""So it's not well suited to that global macro, you know, Putin invades Ukraine what will be the global economic response to that over the next 12 months?"", ""There's no system that's going to do that immediate short term predation on price action and equities derivatives."", ""Yes, it's very good at that."", 'But the longer term stuff.', 'No.', ""And I don't see that changing."", 'So you made a comment here in the beginning when you drew the contrast with generative A I.', ""And it sounds like you're a little bit skeptical of that models the, the way that it collects information or its ownership or lack thereof of the data."", 'Correct?', ""So I'm curious your view on whether you think there should be rules around those kinds of things when it comes to gender A I?"", ""Well, I mean, that's a, it's a big question to ask and answer in terms of the capacity to potentially answer any question that you might ask."", 'No, it it needs to have this latitude.', ""These large language models are enormous and obviously incredibly costly to run because you can't determine what someone is going to need, require or want to review."", 'It can be information collection, it can be creation.', ""So you're going to have to allow it a lot of latitude with predictive A I, whether it's flying a plane or driving a boat or trading stock, you needed to do one specific task with a high degree of certainty."", 'And so the hard landscape surrounding those data is important and thankfully that aligns with that type of technology.', ""But for the larger

picture.', 'Chad your take on the consumer and, and where they are right now, it was just sort of interesting to walk through this earnings season and try to read the tea leaves um just where you thought they were.', 'Uh so some executives, I I actually was impressed when I heard something like like Uber and Lyft and how generally optimistic they sound the consumer.', 'But what was your take so broad based?', 'I think that the consumer is quite strong.', 'Uh They, well, they, they got a lot of tailwind regarding savings, uh wage inflation has been going higher that bodes well for consumption uh as well as a full employment picture here in the United States.', 'Uh So for us, we think that it bodes well, overall in aggregate or big box retailers, of course, there are certain retailers that will do much better and then there are others that are going to lapse doing in part because of the big post COVID surge.', 'The normalization cycle is around the corner.', 'Well, maybe on that front, Chris, I wanna bring you in.', ""Uh, you know, I think that the Walmart's the world more squarely fit into our idea of what value the value proposition is right now."", 'Maybe we struggle a little bit more with the Home Improvement retailers which I know you cover as well.', ""Talking about Home Depot and Lowe's, I think you have a buy rating on both."", 'How, how do they fit in into this current consumer environment?', 'Yeah, I I and I think the multi year strategy is that there is a huge portion of the population who has locked in very low mortgage rates.', ""Uh We've seen in the housing numbers that they're not moving."", 'So maybe a lot of people you also have uh baby boomers who are aging in place and you have a large number of millennials who you know, are going to buy a house.', ""Uh but it's probably not going to be the house they dreamed of."", ""And I think all of that spells Home Improvement, the baby boomers are gonna upgrade homes so that they, they can stay longer, whether it's showers or baths, um or railings or other things."", ""Uh a lot of people who are saying, you know, we've got a low mortgage, we're going to stay in our house."", ""They're probably gonna do kitchens and bathrooms and all kinds of things to make their existing home more livable."", 'So, you know, there may be a couple of near term challenges but, but longer term, I think, I think it makes a lot of sense.', ""Well, that's what I wanted to follow up on Chris."", ""You know, what you're describing, that sort of longer term trend?"", 'Are we gonna see that in the upcoming earnings or is that more just something investors should kind of ride out and wait for?', ""I mean, they, they're good quality businesses, they, they pay dividends."", ""Um, and the thing is, I don't think we know exactly when the turn is going to be and, and the other thing is like, all we need to see is a little bit of sign of an inflection."", ""So I think the long term thesis makes a lot of sense looking at the, you know, Harvard's leading indicator of remodeling activity."", ""It's probably later in the year before we, before we see a turn there."", ""But, I mean, I think it's a thesis that makes a lot of sense."", ""And, um, I think the businesses are, you know, are going to weather that and if the change, whether it's from the Fed or somewhere else happens a little bit earlier, you know, you're there with good quality businesses rather than chasing Chad."", 'I want to bring you in here as well.', 'Get your, your take on Home Depot.', ""It sounds chad like about that name you're saying, listen, um some short term headwinds but longer term smart place to be right."", 'And I completely agree with Chris, uh when it comes to Home Depot, uh we own it in our rising dividend portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over five years."", 'It, it has very little debt.', ""Uh, it is consistently growing and, uh when it comes to profitability, it's, it's has a high return on invested capital, capital."", 'Uh, and like Chris, I echo that you want to own this as a core position over the next 3 to 5 years.', 'When that turn comes in the housing market, uh this stock will gap higher.', 'Uh So, uh, we would be a buyer within that, uh within uh uh with, with Home Depot.', ""Um Let's chat."", ""Let's get to then the others, the, the Walmarts and targets that are coming up as well."", ""Um Do you, uh, I'll take you first on this chat."", 'Do you like one over the other?', 'Do you think those are both gonna provide um, a go a good opportunity for investors, especially with the catalyst of the upcoming earnings as well.', 'Yeah, we, we like and we favor Walmart.', 'We have it in both our rising dividends and all c portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over over seven years."", 'We believe that their their diversification in regard to omni channel has been quite successful.', ""They're now able to compete, I believe, head on with Amazon."", 'So we favor that one over target.', 'If there is a softening within the consumption, consumer or consumption, we think that Walmart will be able to take market share from Target Chris.', 'I wanna get you back in here.', 'Get your thoughts on those two names as well.', 'How are you thinking about Walmart?', 'Walmart and Target?', 'Yeah, I, I like Walmart.', ""I think they've built a tremendous amount of goodwill, um, over the last several months in lowering the prices of things like French bread and rotisserie chicken at times where people are concerned about prices."", 'You know, they, they look to Walmart as a place that can help.', ""Uh, the other thing we've seen is that, you know, households that make over $100,000 a year are going to Walmart."", ""So when this change or when it's a little bit of turn with the consumer happens, Walmart's gonna try to retain those customers."", ""Uh, they're investing in their, their discretionary stuff, their home products and that should be good for them."", ""Um, you know, the, the question I think clients, others ask is, you know, we see the case for, for Walmart right now, but what's the next step, whether it's three or six months down the road?"", ""And I think it's a little bit similar to what we were saying with, with home Depot, uh, Target has, uh, more of a discretionary business and, you know, I think when we see that turn, I mean, in the meantime, they, they still have, um, you know, staples and they still have decent traffic and they're still, you know, appealing to people who want convenience."", 'But I think once their, um, their home and apparel comes back in a stronger way, we should see that go right to margins.', 'Chris Chad.', 'Thank you guys both for joining the show today.', 'Have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.', 'Thanks.', ""Well, wrapping up today's market domination."", ""Don't go anywhere."", ""We've got you covered with all the action following the closing bell."", 'Stay tuned for market domination over

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'As you can see below, Salesforce had US$9.43b of debt at January 2024, down from US$10.6b a year prior. But on the other hand it also has US$14.2b in cash, leading to a US$4.77b net cash position.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Salesforce had liabilities of US$26.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$13.5b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$14.2b as well as receivables valued at US$11.4b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$14.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Given Salesforce has a humongous market capitalization of US$266.9b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Salesforce also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely."", ""Even more impressive was the fact that Salesforce grew its EBIT by 223% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Salesforce's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Salesforce may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces."", ""We could understand if investors are concerned about Salesforce's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.77b. The cherry on top was that in converted 251% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$9.5b. So we don't think Salesforce's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Salesforce that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is widely credited to be one of the most advanced personal computing companies in the world is the firm's ability to blend in a device's design with high end specifications. A key aspect of product design is manufacturing, which has slowly grown to become one of the most advanced industries in the world. Advances in manufacturing have also nearly completely re shaped the landscape of today's technologies, with one high end manufacturing category, i.e. 3D printing or additive manufacturing, reshaping the way designers, businesses, and consumers produce and order gadgets."", ""3D printing's utility allows high end jet engine manufacturers, such as General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) subsidiary Pratt & Whitney to fabricate complex components with high degrees of precision. At the same time, it also enables firms like the Ireland based medical device manufacturer Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to create life like models of human organs such as the heart for testing, training, and other uses. For a detailed look at how GE and others are using 3D printing, you should read 10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy."", ""While the allure of 3D printing to transform industries and generate revenue has always been strong, these stocks, like others that require significant capital investment, fluctuate in response to economic conditions. As proof, consider the performance of the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF). It is one of the earliest collections of 3D printing stocks which predates Ark Investment's well known The 3D Printing ETF (BATS:PRNT). Year to date, the Solactive index is down by 2.4%. However, the 3D printing stock index closed 3.9% higher on April 11th, which has proven as one of the most important stock market dates this year. The following day, markets and investor sentiment reworked their expectations for interest rate cuts later this year after evaluating fresh inflation data and earnings from big banks and saw them struggle with high costs which disappointed Wall Street estimates for net interest income. You can read more about this turmoil by clicking on 20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024."", ""Shifting gears, while 3D printing stocks have responded negatively to investors shifting their rate cut expectations forward, individual stocks might be doing better. Some of the oldest 3D printing stocks you're likely to find are Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD). These two have been trading on the stock market since the 1990s, and among them, Startsys's shares have been the better performers. They are up by 466% in all time price gains, for a nice chunk of returns which peaked in 2014 when the shares touched $140. And just as is the case for the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF) these 3D printing stocks also jumped in 2021 after investors and media hyped up the potential offered by printers to create alternatives to traditional supply chain and manufacturing resources that were harmed by the post pandemic lockdowns."", ""These fluctuations are a classic representation of 3D printing stocks, which soar in popularity, see a growth in adoption, and then slowly fade away to bide their time. 2021's 3D printing stock peak also led to this industry joining the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) fever amongst firms eager to try their hand at a public listing. Some 3D printing stocks that went public during this time are Markforged Holding Corporation (NYSE:MKFG), Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE:VLD), and Shapeways Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHPW). Neither of these are stellar performers, and we can't blame them given how high interest rates have gotten since their listing."", 'One 3D printing stock that has bucked the trend of being red in 2024 is the Boston based software firm PTC Inc.

This enables it to directly benefit from any growth in the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies. Additionally, in case of a slowdown in 3D printing, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) also benefits from product management and industrial software which allow it to generate recurring revenue. The shares have gained 6.7% year to date, outpacing the gains of all 3D printing stocks in this introduction and the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF).', ""The latest bit about this top performing 3D printing stock is for its first quarter earnings. The results saw PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) post $603 million in revenue and $0.95 in earnings per share. These beat analyst estimates of $576 million for revenue and $0.74 for the EPS. At its earnings call, management shared that PTC's Creo software, used primarily in 3D printing applications, had led to an 11% annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth for its CAD business division."", 'So, as 3D printing stocks continue to prove to be an interesting bunch, we decided to see which stocks are finding favor with analysts. Analysts spend countless hours pouring over financial statements and business models to decide whether a firm can enhance its cash flow and shareholder value in the future. For 3D printing stocks, their take can provide important insight due to the hurdles that the industry faces with wide scale adoption and the stable potential offered by the software side.

Amazon.com Inc. just this week took over a giant conference hall in downtown Singapore to unfurl a $9 billion investment plan before a thousands-strong audience cheering and waving glow sticks.', 'After decades of playing second fiddle to China and Japan, the region of about 675 million people is drawing more tech investment than ever. For data centers alone, the world’s biggest companies are set to splurge up to $60 billion over the next few years as Southeast Asia’s young populations embrace video streaming, online shopping and generative AI.', 'Traditionally welcoming to Western investment, the region’s moment has arrived as China turns more hostile to US firms and India remains tougher to navigate politically. Silicon Valley is setting its sights on business-friendly regimes, fast-growing talent pools and rising incomes. The advent of AI is spurring tech leaders to pursue new sources of growth, laying the digital infrastructure of the region’s future.', '“Countries like Singapore and Malaysia are largely neutral to the geopolitical tensions happening with China, US, Ukraine and Russia,” said Sean Lim, a managing partner at Singapore-based NWD Holdings, which invests in AI-based projects and other areas. “Especially with the ongoing wars, this region has become more attractive.”', 'Take Tim Cook and Satya Nadella, who last month embarked on their biggest tours across Southeast Asia in years.

In Bangkok, under a ballroom’s shimmering chandeliers, he was seen shaking hands and conversing with high-ranking government officials and the country’s top business elites.', 'Southeast Asia’s draw becomes apparent once you consider slowing toplines in Silicon Valley, which is struggling now to lay the foundations of AI — anticipated to become an industry-defining technology. Within the next few weeks, two major AI-themed events in Singapore are set to feature top leaders from OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft and others to further tout the technology’s promise for Southeast Asia.', 'A specific catalyst for the tech companies is generative AI, with services like ChatGPT rapidly gaining users.

That's Not a Good Sign for Walgreens,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1723b137-3aeb-3142-9913-d934cf9b18ee/walmart-is-closing-down-its.html,1715414100,STORY,"['WBA', 'WMT']","[""Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is in the midst of a turnaround strategy that includes launching hundreds of health clinics. In recent years, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has also shown interest in healthcare, opening dozens of health centers nationwide within its stores. But last week, Walmart announced it's giving up on that strategy."", ""Walgreens investors may be breathing a sigh of relief, knowing that the company won't have to worry about Walmart as a competitor in this arena. However, the strategy change may not be good news for Walgreens."", ""Walmart's recent announcement should raise some red flags for investors."", 'Walmart management had touted healthcare as a promising growth opportunity for the big-box retailer. The retail giant offered low-priced health and dental services that would provide consumers with cost-effective options. It would also give them more of a reason to visit their local Walmart, to not only shop but to also stop in and get a checkup.', 'Up until recently, Walmart promoted optimistic plans for healthcare. A year ago, the plan was to double its footprint and have more than 75 health centers across the U.S. by the end of 2024. Those plans changed dramatically. Walmart said late last month that it would close its 51 health centers by the end of July. It will also shut down its virtual healthcare operations.', 'A company spokesperson explained, ""Healthcare is expensive to run. We were finding that the increased labor and operating costs environment, like with reimbursement, both public and private, made it difficult.""', ""Walmart closing down its health centers may sound like a positive development for Walgreens. After all, no one wants Walmart as a competitor. But the bigger takeaway is that a business with vast, diverse, and complex operations such as Walmart can't find a way to make its healthcare business profitable -- at least, not at a level it's comfortable with. And it's not as if Walmart generates massive margins. While it has reported $15.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months, that was on revenue of $648.1 billion, which equates to a profit margin of just 2.4%."", ""Walmart likely wasn't going into this hoping it would be hugely profitable. By offering low-cost health and dental options, odds are it knew the margins would be slim. And yet the actual numbers came in worse than expected. Labor costs have been rising in recent years and inflation certainly hasn't helped, either. A lot has changed since 2019 when Walmart first announced its ambitions for health centers. But as recently as last year, it was still expecting to launch more health centers."", ""This doesn't bode well for Walgreens. The company has invested billions into primary care operator VillageMD in an effort to open health clinics at its stores. And its aims are far grander than Walmart's; in 2021, it set out a target for 1,000 health clinics by 2027. But that goal looks doubtful with the company recently announcing it will shut down 160 VillageMD locations as it tries to improve profitability. In three of the past four quarters, Walgreens has incurred a net loss."", ""Unlike Walmart, Walgreens hasn't pulled the plug on its healthcare operations. And odds are, it isn't going to. The company cut its dividend this year in an effort to free up resources and strengthen its balance sheet. Last year, it also brought on a new CEO, Tim Wentworth, who has a strong background in healthcare. It doesn't appear Walgreens is doing anything but going all-in on its healthcare venture."", ""But if Walmart can't make it work with its far greater resources to pull from, I'm not optimistic that the pharmacy retailer will fare any better."", ""Walgreens is trying to turn around its stock by strengthening its margins and winning back investors. But with Walmart abandoning its health plans due to a lack of profitability, I'm inclined to be less optimistic that Walgreens can succeed where Walmart can't. While Walgreens may not be as aggressive on price as Walmart, it's still going to be an uphill battle to grow its operations and get out of the red."", ""Expect things to get worse for Walgreens. If the business can't prove it's on the right track and heading toward profitability, then this already struggling stock (it's down 46% in the past 12 months) will go lower. The most prudent option for investors interested in the stork is to wait on the sidelines and see how it progresses. Walgreens isn't a safer investment based on this Walmart news."", 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 28% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 22% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', 'During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Starbucks actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 63% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.', ""Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics."", ""Revenue is actually up 12% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either.

India is the only country that could possibly displace China as the manufacturer for the world, but India is lacking transportation infrastructure and it would take at least a decade to close the gap on its current disadvantages relative to China.', 'Ladd also explained why he thinks the Federal Trade Commission is taking the wrong approach in its antitrust complaint against Amazon and outlined why “Starbucks is in a world of hurt.” He considers that customer experience at Starbucks to be generally very poor.

Fluctuating commodity prices, rising input costs, trade uncertainties and elevated operational expenses have been affecting players for a while. As prices increase across the board, companies within this vital sector are grappling with challenges that impact their operations, profitability and long-term sustainability.However, the industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets, and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Corteva Inc. CTVA, Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Alico ALCO and Adecoagro AGRO.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial products). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology. The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mainly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.', 'Factors Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations Industry', 'Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to fluctuating commodity prices, rising input costs and trade uncertainties. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. One of the most immediate and tangible impacts of inflation on the agricultural operations industry is the surge in input costs. As inflation has escalated the prices of essential resources, the cost of production for agricultural companies has soared, squeezing profit margins. The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter rising raw material costs. The industry participants seek to counter global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue hurting margins and profitability in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2024 (ending Sep 30, 2024) of $170.5 billion marks an increase of $1 billion from the November 2023 forecast of $169.5 billion. The export forecasts have been revised on exports of livestock and dairy, as well as grains and feeds. This is likely to more than offset the reductions in oilseeds and products.Robust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has benefited from an organic movement prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth. Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate purchasing and consuming alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects', 'The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #148, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

If you want to earn more frequent flyer miles, get free (or discounted) airline tickets and upgrades, and otherwise get more out of your air travel experiences, you might think that having elite status would be a ticket to a rarefied world of comfort and ease.', 'The truth is more complicated. Many air travel experts are debating whether making extra effort to chase elite status is still worth it. Airlines have cut back on some elite status perks in recent years, and have changed the rules for elite status in ways that can be confusing and customer-unfriendly.', 'Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards', ""I personally do not have elite status with any airlines. So maybe I'm just jealous. But based on my research and my life experience as an airline customer, I'm not super impressed by the offerings of elite status programs."", ""Let's look at a few reasons why airline elite status might be overrated -- and where you should spend your time, energy, and dollars instead."", ""Every airline has different rules, brand names, and specific terminology for how to get elite status. To its credit, Southwest Airlines has one of the most customer-friendly, easy-to-understand elite status programs: just take 10 round-trip flights, and you've got status!"", 'But most other airlines bombard you with fine print and legalese. You have to rack up a certain number of qualifying flights, but not every flight qualifies. Or you can earn qualifying ""points,"" but these points are not the same as frequent flyer miles, and also not the same as credit card reward points.', 'Airline elite status programs also have multiple tiers, like, ""Silver,"" ""Gold,"" etc. -- but the tiers are also confusing. You get certain benefits with each tier of status, and the perks get sweeter as you climb the status ladder. But the overall effect of reading about elite airline status on the airlines\' websites can often feel exhausting and discombobulating, rather than inspiring.', 'None of this makes me want to grab my credit card and start strategically spending and booking flights. It mostly makes me question whether the effort is worth it at all.', 'You might think that having elite status with an airline would guarantee you a wide range of VIP perks, like airport lounge access. But airlines have been cutting back on lounge access, even for elite status members. If you want free lounge access, the easiest way might be to have the right (higher-fee) premium travel credit card, not just elite status.', ""And if getting access to in-demand perks like the airport lounge is only based on which airline credit card you have in your wallet, why bother chasing elite status at all? You don't have to fly dozens of times per year. You might as well just focus on which travel perks you want, and choose travel credit cards that give you those perks."", 'If you really sit down and read the list of perks and benefits offered by each tier of airline elite status program, they become less impressive. Yes, elite status gives you some nice benefits like eligibility for free upgrades and multipliers of your frequent flyer miles, so you can earn more miles more quickly.', ""But most of the rest of the perks feel pretty flimsy to me. I don't need a free checked bag; I travel light. (And even if you want a free checked bag, the best airline credit cards can give you that perk -- no elite status required.) Do you really care about priority boarding? Is it worth thousands of dollars for you to get to stand in a special little line and sit on the plane for an extra 30 minutes?"", ""Are these mundane status signifiers supposed to make people feel like their lives are more valuable than the rest of us commoners who are sitting in basic economy? Whatever makes people happy, I guess. But I'd rather just get a cheaper plane ticket and choose my own perks, a la carte style!"", ""If you already fly so frequently that your miles and your status-qualifying achievements are piling up without you even realizing it, elite airline status could be worth getting. But I don't see the point of working too hard or making extra effort to pursue status with airlines. The rules are complicated, and most of the best benefits can be achieved in other ways. Instead of chasing elite status, just choose the right travel credit cards."", ""This credit card\xa0is not just good – it's so exceptional that our experts use it personally. It\xa0features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, a cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee!\xa0"", 'Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.

I think it's not overly complicated in the sense that they saw what we had done historically, both with [Authentic Brands Group] and Sparc, and offered us to participate with no capital, but also add our expertise and our knowledge,” David Simon said. “And because we have always valued Express as a retailer and as a client, we jumped at the opportunity.”"", 'WHP Global holds a majority stake in an intellectual property joint venture with the bankrupt apparel retailer, which filed under Chapter 11 last month saying it planned to close more than 100 stores.\xa0Express Inc. has also said it filed for bankruptcy in order to facilitate a sale, after it received a non-binding letter of intent from the consortium “for the potential sale of a substantial majority of the Company’s retail stores and operations.”', 'Buying up Express would resume an acquisition strategy that Simon Property Group seemed to be abandoning.', 'In recent years the company has partnered with Brookfield and/or Authentic to buy up various troubled retailers, and invested in Authentic itself. The three companies together now own J.C. Penney, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2020. That year Simon and Authentic also formed joint venture Sparc Group, responsible for the retail operations of various brands, including Forever 21, Brooks Brothers and others,\xa0whose IP is owned by Authentic.', 'However, the addition of retail to a REIT’s portfolio represents a level of business volatility that some observers view as contrary to the typical appeal of real estate investment. David Simon has long acknowledged that volatility but has emphasized the REIT’s minimal exposure.', 'Still, its retail investments have been in decline. In Q1 the net operating losses from Simon Property Group’s “other platform investments” — which included J.C. Penney, Sparc, Authentic,\xa0e-commerce company Rue Gilt Groupe and real estate development company Jamestown\xa0— widened to $83 million, from $27.5 million a year ago, according to Monday’s earnings presentation. At J.C. Penney in particular, net sales during its most recently reported quarter fell 10.7% year over year to $1.5 billion, as net loss widened by 76.5% to $30 million.\xa0For the nine months ended Oct. 28, EBITDA plunged 55.3% to $181 million.', ""On Monday, David Simon said the company is “pleased with Penney,” adding that the department store “is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's not high sales” and that it could benefit from opening new stores.\xa0But Simon has been unwinding its stakes in other retailers and brands for months."", 'Last year,\xa0David Simon told analysts that the company could pull out of its retail investments within five or 10 years, and the company promptly began that process:\xa0in 2023 it reduced its stake in Sparc\xa0from 50% to 33% and disclosed it had sold off its interest in an Eddie Bauer licensing\xa0joint venture.', 'Most recently, the REIT completely divested from Authentic Brands Group, a process also begun last year. On Monday, Simon said that during the first quarter it sold its remaining interest in the brand management firm. Factoring in the Q4 sale of part of the Authentic stake, the divestment generated total gross proceeds of\u2009 $1.45 billion, according to a Q1 earnings presentation.', 'David Simon told analysts on Monday that, if the Express acquisition goes through, that doesn’t mean the zero-capital price will be a model for future acquisitions of retail tenants. But he said the company remains open to such takeovers.', ""“What does it mean to the portfolio? We don't want volatility, but we'll certainly accept it if we think it's going to be a good investment,” he said."", 'While many analysts believe the mall REITs are pursuing retailers in order to keep their spaces filled, both Simon and Brookfield say their involvement has helped save jobs and businesses that are important to communities.', ""“We're comfortable that Express is a good company and is a great brand, and we can add value to it,” David Simon explained to analysts.\xa0“And given the fact that we were able to hopefully turn around the retailer, save jobs, create value from our investment, we see it as a win-win situation with no capital from our standpoint.”"", ""For his part, Kevin McCrain, chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties’ U.S. operations, earlier this week noted that, with 79 stores at Brookfield Properties, Express is a major tenant.\xa0He also said that the company's investment in J.C. Penney arose in part out of a concern for preserving jobs."", ""“There's an opportunity to potentially acquire part of a legacy brand that is a massive tenant in our asset,” he said, adding that Brookfield has a “great track record” in partnering with a group of investors to acquire retailers."", 'As far as what Simon would bring to the table for this proposed transaction, David Simon offered no details, and a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately respond to questions about that. Speaking to analysts, he said that Simon Property Group would provide expertise for Express’ post-bankruptcy turnaround.', ""“As part of any bankruptcy, we're going to have a lease negotiation,” he said. “Some leases will get restructured, some won't, some will pay what the existing rent is, and so on.”"", 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

really become the dividing line between the haves and the have nots."", 'This is playing out across frankly the corporate sector in terms of large versus small cap uh co companies that are strong

today's deal is telling us that, you know, under this new management regime which has seen, I think what's transformative here is the relationship that they built with their partners in, in including in the FDA, who are allowing them to have a path, you know, which is very streamlined when it comes to having a variant based vaccine."", ""But I think I'm sure you are interested in also

out the pandemic from the picture, you know, we were vaccinating roughly uh north of, you know, 50 to 60 million uh adults every year and a large majority of them were and elderly, right, the vaccination rates tend to be higher on that.', 'So if you think about that market is at least what you would look to protect.', 'And um there is obviously a data, you know, as, as you might, as you guys are aware that Nova was working on a, a flu vaccine before COVID even came along and they had positive phase three results.', ""So what today's uh update and development does is actually bring that back almost from the uh uh ashes to be able to develop as a stand alone vaccine, a flu vaccine."", 'Uh And then uh the combination points up uh vaccine would be in addition to that stand-alone

think we'll see the guidelines in the medical professional bodies."", ""You know, the recommendations around uh having protection for both and, and if safety and efficacy and importantly,

to comment on activist uh situations, but I think just at the highest level, it, it it was, I think directionally uh pointing to the things that the management was already working on and today's deal actually confirms that, right, like one of the uh uh recommendations or uh you know, ask for the, for the management was to engage in a process or engage with a credible partner that we have in Sanofi

price action that we want to take advantage of."", ""And we see this over and over again and there's a reasonable amount of certainty and we can use it to to that end."", ""And so basically, it's all, it's not fundamental analysis at all, it is just based on."", ""So it's effectively predictive A I based on technical analysis to some extent, if you wanna share the the secret sauce rii I knew that

right?"", 'You, you, so you found some tasks where you think?', ""OK, predictive A I in my world, it doesn't make sense."", ""Are there ones where you think, you know what this tech, this tech is not up to that task ones you wouldn't want to see it apply to?"", 'Yeah.', 'Sure.', 'Absolutely.', ""Obviously, anything with a long term time frame, I don't care if it's human or machine, there's no

collects information or its ownership or lack thereof of the data."", 'Correct?', ""So I'm curious your view on whether you think there should be rules around those kinds of things when it comes to gender A I?"", ""Well, I mean, that's a, it's a big question to ask and answer in terms of the capacity to potentially answer any question that you might ask."", 'No, it it needs to have this latitude.', ""These large language models are enormous and obviously incredibly costly to run because you can't determine what someone is going to need, require or want to review."", 'It can be information collection, it can be creation.', ""So you're going to have to allow it a lot of latitude with predictive A I, whether it's flying a plane or driving a boat or trading stock, you needed to

thought they were.', 'Uh so some executives, I I actually was impressed when I heard something like like Uber and Lyft and how generally optimistic they sound the consumer.', 'But what was your take so broad based?', 'I think that the consumer is quite strong.', 'Uh They, well, they, they got a lot of tailwind regarding savings, uh wage inflation has been going higher that bodes well for consumption uh as well as a full employment picture here in the United States.', 'Uh So for us, we think that it bodes well, overall in aggregate or big box retailers, of course, there are certain retailers that will do much better and then there are others that are going to lapse doing in part because of the big post COVID surge.', 'The normalization cycle is around the corner.', 'Well, maybe on that front, Chris, I wanna bring you in.', ""Uh, you know, I think that the Walmart's the world more squarely fit into our idea of what value the value proposition is right now."", 'Maybe we struggle a little bit more with the Home Improvement retailers which I know you cover as well.', ""Talking about Home Depot and Lowe's, I think you have a buy rating on both."", 'How, how do they fit in into this current consumer environment?', 'Yeah, I I and I think the multi year strategy is that there is a huge portion of the population who has locked in very low mortgage rates.', ""Uh We've seen in the housing numbers that they're not moving."", 'So maybe a lot of people you also have uh baby boomers who are aging in place and you have a large number of millennials who you know, are going to buy a house.', ""Uh but it's probably not going to be the house they dreamed of."", ""And I think all of that spells Home Improvement, the baby boomers are gonna upgrade homes so that they, they can stay longer, whether it's showers or baths, um or railings or other things."", ""Uh a lot of people who are saying, you know, we've got a low mortgage, we're going to stay in our house."", ""They're probably gonna do kitchens and bathrooms and all kinds of things to make their existing home more livable."", 'So, you know, there may be a couple of near term challenges but, but longer term, I think, I think it makes a lot of sense.', ""Well, that's what I wanted to follow up on Chris."", ""You know, what you're describing, that sort of longer term trend?"", 'Are we gonna see that in the upcoming earnings or is that more just something investors should kind of ride out and wait for?', ""I mean, they, they're good quality businesses, they, they pay dividends."", ""Um, and the thing is, I don't think we know exactly when the turn is going to be and, and the other thing is like, all we need to see is a little bit of sign of an inflection."", ""So I think the long term thesis makes a lot of sense looking at the, you know, Harvard's leading indicator of remodeling activity."", ""It's probably later in the year before we, before we see a turn there."", ""But, I mean, I think it's a thesis that makes a lot of sense."", ""And, um, I think the businesses are, you know, are going to weather that and if the change, whether it's from the Fed or somewhere else happens a little bit earlier, you know, you're there with good quality businesses rather than chasing Chad."", 'I want to bring you in here as well.', 'Get your, your take on Home Depot.', ""It sounds chad like about that name you're saying, listen, um some short term headwinds but longer term smart place to be right."", 'And I completely agree with Chris, uh when it comes to Home Depot, uh we own it in our rising dividend portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over five years."", 'It, it has very little debt.', ""Uh, it is consistently growing and, uh when it comes to profitability, it's, it's has a high return on invested capital, capital."", 'Uh, and like Chris, I echo that you want to own this as a core position over the next 3 to 5 years.', 'When that turn comes in the housing market, uh this stock will gap higher.', 'Uh So, uh, we would be a buyer within that, uh within uh uh with, with Home Depot.', ""Um Let's chat."", ""Let's get to then the others, the, the Walmarts and targets that are coming up as well."", ""Um Do you, uh, I'll take you first on this chat."", 'Do you like one over the other?', 'Do you think those are both gonna provide um, a go a good opportunity for investors, especially with the catalyst of the upcoming earnings as well.', 'Yeah, we, we like and we favor Walmart.', 'We have it in both our rising dividends and all c portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over over seven years."", 'We believe that their their diversification in regard to omni channel has been quite successful.', ""They're now able to compete, I believe, head on with Amazon."", 'So we favor that one over target.', 'If there is a softening within the consumption, consumer or consumption, we think that Walmart will be able to take market share from Target Chris.', 'I wanna get you back in here.', 'Get your thoughts on those two names as well.', 'How are you thinking about Walmart?', 'Walmart and Target?', 'Yeah, I, I like Walmart.', ""I think they've built a tremendous amount of goodwill, um, over the last several months in lowering the prices of things like French bread and rotisserie chicken at times where people are concerned about prices."", 'You know, they, they look to Walmart as a place that can help.', ""Uh, the other thing we've seen is that, you know, households that make over $100,000 a year are going to Walmart."", ""So when this change or when it's a little bit of turn with the consumer happens, Walmart's gonna try to retain those customers."", ""Uh, they're investing in their, their discretionary stuff, their home products and that should be good for them."", ""Um, you know, the, the question I think clients, others ask is, you know, we see the case for, for Walmart right now, but what's the next step, whether it's three or six months down the road?"", ""And I think it's a little bit similar to what we were saying with, with home Depot, uh, Target has, uh, more of a discretionary business and, you know, I think when we see that turn, I mean, in the meantime, they, they still have, um, you know, staples and they still have decent traffic and they're still, you know, appealing to people who want convenience."", 'But I think once their, um, their home and apparel comes back in a stronger way, we should see that go right to margins.', 'Chris Chad.', 'Thank you guys both for joining the show today.', 'Have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.',

Since its formation in 2009, Brookfield Infrastructure has grown its funds from operations (FFO) per share at a 15% compound annual rate. That has supported 10% compound annual dividend growth. ', 'Brookfield Infrastructure expects to grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually over the next several years. That supports its belief that it can deliver 5% to 9% annual dividend growth. ', 'The company expects a trio of organic growth drivers (inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects) to fuel 6% to 9% annual FFO per share growth. Brookfield Infrastructure expects its accretive capital recycling strategy to drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. The company has an exceptional track record of selling mature businesses and redeploying the proceeds into higher-returning opportunities. ', ""The company expects to sell $2 billion of assets this year ($1.2 billion of which it has already secured). That will give it the cash to deploy into new opportunities. It recently increased its stake in its integrated Brazilian rail and logistics provider and agreed to buy a portfolio of telecom towers in India. Meanwhile, the company noted that it's screening a large pipeline of early stage mergers and acquisitions opportunities that could drive compelling returns.

In the past, it has capitalized on them by repurchasing its shares and buying stocks of companies it wants to acquire, often leading to deals. Meanwhile, sell-offs are opportunities for investors to buy shares of this high-quality company at a lower price, positioning them to generate more dividend income and earn higher total returns in the future.', ""NextEra Energy and Brookfield Infrastructure are great dividend stocks. They offer above-average yields and have delivered above-average dividend growth over the last decade. They have plenty of power to continue increasing their payouts in the future.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor.', ""But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs."", 'That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud.', 'Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun.', 'The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones.', 'AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips.', 'All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years.', 'Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.', 'During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks.', 'Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.', 'You can’t mention AI performance without talking about Nvidia, but it’s almost unfair to compare its chips to the competition. That’s because Nvidia’s graphics chips are dedicated to graphics processing and can be programmed to run AI apps. But because they’re not multipurpose chips like those from Apple, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, they’re far more capable. In fact, Nvidia claims its laptop chips offer 20x to 60x the performance of competing neural processing units.', 'The point is, there’s a new stat for these tech companies to battle over, and you can be sure they’ll do just that. The fact that Apple had already come out swinging with its own measurement is proof enough of that.', 'What does that mean for the average consumer? Not all that much just yet. Generative AI apps running on PCs and Macs and iPads are still few and far between. So far, there are programs that help you manipulate photos and videos or track your eye movement in video chat apps.', 'But there’s still no killer app that would get me to go running out the door to pick up an AI PC. That could all change in the coming weeks, though. That’s because Microsoft and Apple are set to kick off their annual developers conferences, where they’re expected to debut a slew of AI apps and services, and at least some of those should run on their respective devices.', 'How much they manage to entice consumers to pony up for AI PCs and the like, however, will depend on whether they’re truly useful or not.', 'Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:QCOM) is a very profitable chip design company that profits from prior licensing deals for its telecom chips and its growing revenue from cloud, artificial intelligence and automotive-related chip designs.', 'In effect, the company is a veritable cash cow given that its free cash flow margins are very high.', 'As a result, the stock looks deeply undervalued. It could easily be worth 30% more than its price of $179.64 on May 3. This analysis will explain why.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with QCOM.', 'Qualcomm reported nominal top-line fiscal second-quarter results on May 1 for the three months ending March 24. Net revenue rose just 1% year over year, though its fast-growing automotive QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technology) revenue shot up 35%.', ""The company divides its revenue into two major segments, QCT and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing). The latter division's revenue was up 2% year over year and includes more than just its legacy telecom chip revenue licensing, (i.e., its popular Snapdragon automotive chip sales)."", 'However, its diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was much stronger, rising 14%.', 'The key drivers for its growth were low expenses, low capital expenditure requirements and continued growth in underlying licensing volumes.', 'More importantly, the company generates significant amounts of operating and free cash flow.', 'Free cash flow is what Qualcomm has left over after all cash expenses and capex spending, as well as net changes in working capital.', ""Qualcomm reported that in the last six months, its operating cash flow was $6.5 billion, or 42.8% higher than its prior year's six-month period FCF of just $4.55 billion."", ""Moreover, due to significantly lower capex spending, the FCF for the past six months was $6.1 billion. That represented a huge 65% higher than last year's $3.7 billion FCF. This can be seen in the company's consolidated cash flow statement:"", 'This is also important from the standpoint of its FCF margin. That ratio measures the amount of revenue that eventually turns into FCF. For example, since Qualcomm made $19.32 billion in sales in the past six months, that means its FCF margin was 31.56%.', 'Moreover, over the trailing 12 months, which helps to smooth out seasonal issues, Qualcomm had a much higher FCF margin.', 'The table below shows that it made 33.7% FCF in the trailing 12-month period ending March 24 (i.e., fiscal second quarter). This was higher than the 27% FCF margin it made last fiscal year.', 'Analysts now project Qualcomm will make $38.30 billion in revenue this fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and $42.20 billion next year. This represents 5.20% sales growth this year and 10.10% growth next year.', 'However, to be conservative, I have projected just 31.50% FCF margins for the next two years. That is similar to the 31.56% FCF margin it made in the last six months, as I pointed out above.', ""This results in an estimated $12.10 billion in FCF projected for this fiscal year. That represents 23.50% growth over last year's $9.80 billion FCF."", 'Moreover, next year we project $13.30 billion in FCF.', ""This implies the stock could be worth significantly more. Let's look at how to calculate a target price."", 'As in past discussions, I have pointed out that using an FCF yield metric is a good way to value high FCF margin stocks.', 'For example, using a 5% FCF yield to value Qualcomm assumes the company pays out all of its FCF in dividends.', 'Qualcomm actually spent a little over half in the past six months on both dividends and buybacks. It spent $3.30 billion on shareholder returns (i.e., $1.515 billion on buybacks and $1.79 on dividends), or 54% of its $6.10 billion in FCF (as seen in the consolidated statement of cash flows table).', 'But what would the yield be if 100% of the $6.10 billion were to be paid out to shareholders?', 'The stock would likely have at least a 4% to 5% dividend yield. The reason is its dividend yield now is 1.89%, but that is with a payout ratio of about half of its available free cash flow. So if we doubled that and added a little more (since investors prefer buybacks for tax reasons), the yield would approach 4%.', ""But just to be conservative, let's assume a 5% yield if 100% of the free cash flow was paid in dividends. This is the same as multiplying the FCF estimates for each year by 20. Here is how that would work for the stock price target:"", ""The net result is the average price target is $227.23 per share. That represents an upside of 26.40% over today's price of $179.64."", ""Moreover, as this might be too high an FCF yield, let's assume the market gives the stock a 4.75% dividend yield, or multiplies the FCF estimates by 21.10:"", ""This shows the average price target is $239.08 per share, an upside of 33.10%. Moreover, the average market cap is $260 billion, or 30% over today's market cap of $200 billion"", 'So the net result is the market will value the stock at $233 per share, or 30% higher.', 'One profitable way to play this stock is to buy shares upon an assignment when shorting out of the money (OTM) put options.', 'That way the investor can set a target buy-in price and gain some income in the play.', 'For example, look at the May 24 expiry period option chain for Qualcomm puts.', 'This shows the $170 strike price put option has a bid side premium of $1.06 per put contract. This works out to a 0.62% yield to the short seller of these puts over the next three weeks.', 'That means if an investor secures $17,000 in cash or margin with their brokerage firm, they can immediately make $106 by entering a trade order to Sell to Open one put option at this strike price. This $106 income works out to 0.6235% of the $17,000 invested over the next three weeks.', ""Moreover, over the next 90 days, if the investor can repeat this play, the expected return is 2.49%. That is greater than the stock's annual 1.89% dividend yield."", 'The bottom line is that even if the stock falls over 5% to $170, the investor will have made extra income covering some or all of the unrealized loss. Moreover, they will be happy to own the stock over the long term, as I have shown that Qualcomm is worth at least 30% more.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

IPX1031 found that 90% of Americans plan to travel at some point in 2024 and 50% plan to travel more than they have in previous years. Furthermore, according to the 2024 Global Travel Trends Report by American Express Company (NYSE: AXP), 84% of respondents plan to spend more or the same amount of money on travel in 2024 compared to last year.', 'Based on these figures, the summer 2024 season promises to be one of the busiest vacation periods in history. One segment that thrives during this time of the year is that of beach vacations.

However, in recent years, many tourists have found the most popular tourist hot-spots in the world to be off-putting. Our article on beautiful places in the world  reveals how one reason for this is overtourism. In addition, many individuals look to veer off towards off-beaten tracks and less popular destinations due to their ability to provide comprehensive and affordable travel experiences.', 'One of the reasons that popular destinations fail to provide a comprehensive travel experience is budgets. The steep cost of even the most basic excursions compels tourists to exclude some of these activities from their vacations or risk overspending on their vacations. Data from Mint, a budgeting app, in 2019 showed that while 2.2 million of their users in 2018 created a travel budget to save for their vacation, 44% of them still spent over their travel budget.', 'To ensure tourists can continue to visit popular tourist destinations without being concerned about blowing their budgets, many travel providers and hotels are offering all-inclusive packages. All-inclusive packages enable tourists to budget a comprehensive itinerary in advance, thus mitigating the risks of overpaying. In 2021, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H) bought out the Apple Leisure Group which enabled it to become the global leader in the luxury all-inclusive hotel market.', '“Hyatt and ALG have highly complementary brand portfolios and share a deep commitment to colleague and guest experiences focused on care. Having first entered the fast-growing luxury all-inclusive space in 2013, we are ideally positioned to capture the significant and rising demand for leisure travel and extend the world-class hospitality we provide to a wide range of new travelers.”', '-Mark Hoplamazian, President & CEO, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H)', 'Similarly, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\xa0(NYSE: HLT) has also been steadily increasing its footprint in the all-inclusive hotel market.

Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) are two companies that provide incredibly lucrative deals for some of the world's most popular beach destinations."", ""The Mexican state of Quintana Roo is one of the world's most popular beach vacation destinations. Earlier this year, the Governor’s Office for Quintana Roo announced that 2023 was a record-breaking year for tourism with nearly 21 million tourists. This figure is inclusive of more than 6.1 million cruise ship passengers. The undisputed jewel of Mexican vacation destinations is the island of Cancun, famous for being home to the most spectacular resorts in the world. According to the Mexican Ministry of Tourism, Cancun International Airport received 10.42 million of Mexico's 21.8 million international tourists in 2024, which equates to a 47.7% share. If you're wondering if Cancun is good for all-inclusive vacations, then you'll be pleased to know that it is, and there are dozens of all-inclusive resorts on the island, ranging from luxurious to budget-friendly hotels.

It’s now complete, but the benefits haven’t arrived yet.', '“While it’s going to take somewhat longer than we’d anticipated to see the benefits come through in our numbers, the investments we’ve made rebuilding our consumer business will pay off,” said Gorin during\xa0a call about\xa0Expedia’s first-quarter earnings.', 'Then last weekend, most of Expedia Group’s consumer brands experienced a widespread global outage that made its websites unavailable and disrupted some internal operations. Expedia initially blamed the outage on maintenance issues, but later acknowledged it was “a backend software issue.”', 'In February, Expedia announced that it would be laying off around 1,500 employees, or 9% of the workforce. Many of the affected employees had worked on the tech platform migration project. Expedia Group points out that tech outages can be a common occurrence for big brands, and challenged the notion that the issue was related to layoff.', 'Meanwhile, Expedia Group’s share price has swooned. Expedia’s shares closed at a 52-week high of $160 on February 8, and were 30% lower at around $112 on May 9.', 'In early 2023, Kern predicted that the platform migration would “become big unlocks for us in ’23.” That didn’t come to be as Vrbo’s integration went late into the year. Expedia Group lowered Vrbo’s marketing spend during this period – a step “back” to move forward, as officials described it.', 'It has been ramping Vrbo’s marketing spend back up, but it will take more time to see the gains.', 'When Expedia announced its fourth-quarter earnings February 8, Kern said in a statement that “our work is finally starting to deliver results, and we are in the best place we’ve ever been technologically.”', 'That was three months before Expedia group lowered its guidance.', 'Kern has to be credited with guiding Expedia Group through the pandemic, and undertaking a massive transformation of the company.', 'He got rid of outdated brands and restructured the way employees work, consolidating a variety of teams, such as marketing and tech, that previously had worked at cross-purposes – the Hotels.com brand competing against Expedia.com, for example.', 'Consider what it took to accomplish that. The loyalty system had seven tech stacks before the rollout of the new multi brand loyalty program, One Key. There were 17 customer relationship management systems that have been consolidated into one messaging system for all the brands, the company said. And 13 machine learning platforms have been replaced by one.', 'Expedia officials are optimistic about the future despite the choppy path over the last year.', 'Gorin told analysts last week that membership in the Expedia Group loyalty program is up 40% year-over-year.', '“And when it comes to cross-shopping, what we’ve actually seen is that 25% of people who have redeemed their One Key cash on Vrbo, who had earned that cash on either Hotels.com or Expedia, are completely new to Vrbo,” Gorin said. “So I think that really sort of reassures us in this idea of being able to capture more trips from travelers because of the One Key program. And we will be — we are looking to roll it out internationally later this year.”', 'Expedia launched a website in the United Arab Emirates this month and Kern sees upside internationally, where progress has lagged.', '“On the international side, we’ve seen quite good returns in all the places we’ve pushed into,” Kern told analysts last week. “We’ve tried a number of different ways in, now that we have the product improved, leaning more into performance marketing in some places, leaning more into brand in other places. But we’re seeing broadly good response. We think it’s contributing. It’s just that North America is so large that it’s hard to see in the numbers.”', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%.

However, it’s worth taking a look at MDT’s previous-quarter performance first.', 'The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 in the last reported quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.17%. Medtronic beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.46%.', 'Despite a bright surprise history, the to-be-reported quarter’s estimates are showing a year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings indicates a 7.6% fall from the year-ago period figure to $1.45, while revenues are estimated at $8.44 billion, a 1.3% decrease year over year. However, the company topped both the consensus EPS and revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.', 'Since the past several quarters, Medtronic’s earnings growth has been held back by headwinds like inflation and currency impacts. Its last reported third-quarter fiscal 2024 EPS included an 8% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Like its peers, the impact of the present geopolitical situation, including sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, may have impacts on its revenue and overall performance.', 'Despite these challenges, Medtronic has consistently showcased the resilience of its underlying business fundamentals, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for several quarters in a row. While its recent product launches are driving growth across multiple businesses, a swift pace of several compelling product approvals promises to continue to deliver reliable growth in the years to come.', 'Particularly, the company’s Cranial and Spinal Technologies division is expected to see strong growth in fiscal Q4, banking on the increasing adoption of AiBLE, Medtronic’s spine technology ecosystem. Mazor robotic systems with impressive double-digit unit growth are fast emerging as a key indicator for future growth in this business. This should also be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results.', 'In cardiac pacing, sales of the Micra leadless pacemaker franchise may have surged, too, driven by the launch of the company’s next-generation Micra AV2 and VR2 devices in the United States. Medtronic’s third quarter also marked a return to growth for its Diabetes unit in the United States, with the global adoption of the MiniMed 780G system driving performance. This trend is also likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Medtronic this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.', 'While MDT currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.', 'In recent years, the company has undertaken some foundational changes to the organization, including streamlining the operating model, improving the global operations, supply chain and quality and bringing in expertise from outside the industry. It is actively allocating capital to fast-growth MedTech markets and fueling innovative technologies in areas like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems that ensure its growth over the next decade.', 'Medtronic’s revenues have improved and become more durable from implementing a performance-driven culture and changing incentives underlying the new product approvals in major markets. With a top priority placed on restoring the company’s earnings power, these actions are expected to eventually result in better-leveraged earnings growth through margin stabilization and improvement.', 'Medtronic’s highest growth opportunities, comprising 20% of its revenue today, are in markets that are large and growing faster than the overall company. For example, in Cardiac Ablation, it has significantly invested in the Electrophysiology arm to expand its share in the attractive $8 billion-plus market.', 'Further, in Diabetes, Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G system recently gained a CE Mark for use with the Simplera Sync sensor and is expected for FDA submission in the first half of this calendar year. Within Structural Heart, the new Evolut FX system favorably positions the company in the $6 billion-plus TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) market. In March 2024, the Evolut FX+ TAVR system gained the FDA’s approval for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.', 'In the past year, the stock has lost 7% of its value compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'If we look at the value components, MDT has a Value Score\xa0of B at present.', 'This is evident from the Price/Earnings ratio. MDT shares currently trade at 15.13X forward earnings, well off its five-year high of 30.08X and below the median of 17.89X. The stock is also trading significantly below the industry’s 20.60X.', 'Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The consensus estimate for Medtronic’s 2024 EPS has remained unchanged at $5.20 for the past 90 days and indicates a 1.7% decline from the last fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, the consensus EPS estimate indicates a 5% year-over-year improvement.', 'While Medtronic holds immense potential for long-term growth, given its momentum, ongoing comprehensive transformation, breakthrough innovations and exposure to strong secular growth markets, the company battles significant headwinds from macroeconomic issues and rising expenses, which can significantly dent its bottom-line growth. For now, it might be prudent for investors to avoid buying the stock and continue monitoring MDT’s performance for a better entry point.', 'Here are some medical stocks worth considering:', 'Veracyte’s VCYT revenues of $96.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%.

It is well-poised to benefit from the increase in mobile data usage, spectrum availability and high capital spending by wireless carriers to deploy 4G and 5G networks amid incremental customer demand. However, customer concentration and consolidation in the wireless industry are key concerns for the company. High interest rates add to its woes.', 'The exponential growth in mobile data usage, higher availability of spectrum and deployment of 5G networks at scale are driving significant network investments by carriers who aim to improve and densify their cell sites. Moreover, wireless data consumption is expected to increase considerably over the next several years.This is likely to be driven by the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet of Things and the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing, cloud services and hybrid-working scenarios.Given Crown Castle’s unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 90,000 route miles of fiber (as of the first quarter of 2024) in the top 100 basic trading areas of the United States, it remains well-positioned to capitalize on this upbeat trend.The company’s investments in the fiber and small cell business on the back of acquisitions, constructions and new deployments complement its tower business and offer meaningful upside potential to its 5G growth strategy. Management is working on increasing small-cell deployments and expects to deliver 16,000 new nodes in 2024.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and Crown Castle is committed to that. The company’s dividends are supported by high-quality, long-term contracted lease payments, and it benefits from being a provider of mission-critical shared communication infrastructure assets. CCI has increased its dividend four times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 8.21%. Check Crown Castle’s dividend history here.', 'Customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. As of Mar 31, 2024, around three-fourths of the company’s site rental revenues were derived from T-Mobile (35%), Verizon (19%) and AT&T (20%). A loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line. Moreover, any pullback or rationalization in network spending by carriers might affect Crown Castle’s performance.Crown Castle has a substantially leveraged balance sheet and a significant amount of debt relative to its cash flows. The company’s debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $22.56 billion as of Mar 31, 2024. Moreover, in an elevated interest rate environment, additional borrowings to fund near-term capital expenditures will not only inflate the company’s debt but also raise the cost of borrowings.Management expects incurring interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs between $933 million and $978 million in 2024. Further, with high interest rates still in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Over the past month, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 2.9% compared with the industry’s upside of just 0.1%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM and Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.

Sayler', ""Thanks, Kate, and thanks everyone for joining today's call. We appreciate you taking time to get an update from ESCO this afternoon. We are pleased with the second quarter results and are especially excited about the continued top-line momentum across our business platforms.Sales were up by 9% over the prior year second quarter as our aerospace, Navy, and utility businesses continue to see robust end-market dynamics. It's been busy over the last month as we've worked through our annual strategic planning process with each of our subsidiaries. This is a chance for us to step back and examine what's happening in our end markets and to work on strategies to deliver above-market organic growth.This year's sessions have been particularly energizing as we've seen several long-term trends across the broader economy that support good growth profile as we move ESCO forward.Chris will run you through all of the financial details on the second quarter, but before that I want to pass along a few highlights from the strategy reviews and give you some sense for some of the longer-term dynamics that we are seeing.Starting with Aerospace & Defense, we continue to feel very good about the outlook here. As you saw in the release, we still have high levels of backlog and the top-line sales growth has been strong. The most exciting thing here is what remains in front of us. Our key markets are commercial and defense aerospace, Navy, and space. And while each of these have different drivers, fundamentally they all provide a great foundation for future growth.Commercial and defense aerospace customers are working to execute on long-term build plans to increase build rates, which underpin a strong forecast for ESCO. The Navy remains committed to ramping up submarine production in a manner that will drive significant growth for us. We are also involved in some early-stage developmental projects with positive long-term outlooks. We are driving for high single-digit organic growth from these businesses through the planning cycle.Next is the Utility Group, where the outlook remains bullish. You don't have to look very deep into the headlines to find the growth drivers here. An aging electric grid, increasing power demand from technology and industrial investments in the U.S., and decarbonization goals around the world are driving the need for even more electrification.At ESCO, we have a very well-established diagnostic instrumentation business in Doble that is positioned to capitalize on these market factors and deliver continued excellent results. Additionally, our capabilities in the renewables market have already delivered tremendous results for ESCO and there's more to come. These businesses are highly focused on new product and technology roadmaps to continue meeting customer needs while maintaining our lead in these growing markets.Finally, I'll touch on the Test business. As we discussed last quarter, and as you can see from the press release, Tests got off to a tough start to the year at Q1, and although the revenues softness continued in Q2, the business was able to deliver sequential growth and return to double-digit profitability. It's never fun to go through these kinds of business cycles, but the team is really doing a great job of managing through the current challenges.We've been quick to get cost out of the business, and we are well-positioned as growth returns. We had a great strategy review with this team, and the long-term outlook is bright. This business has broad test and measurement capabilities that apply to a number of end markets, and we certainly expect growth to return in 2025 and beyond.While our primary focus is on organic growth and driving strategies to grow our existing business faster than the markets they serve, while improving operational effectiveness and expanding returns, we are seeing increased opportunities to add to the business through strategic acquisitions, which increase our exposure to our existing long-term growth markets. Hopefully, that gives you a flavor of the things that we've been working on over the past month and a sense of the excitement that we have for the future.As we pivot back to the quarter, I'll turn it over to Chris now, and he will go through the specifics for the great quarter that we just announced."", 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""Thanks, Bryan. Everyone can follow along on the chart presentation. We will start on Page 3, where we have the overall financial highlights of the second quarter.Overall, as Bryan mentioned, the quarter was strong. Starting with orders, you can see there was a 5% reduction in orders compared to last year's second quarter, but the pace of business remains good, and we finished the quarter with $838 million of backlog, which is nearly $100 million higher than March 31, of last year.Sales in the quarter were up 9%, with organic growth of 8%, and 1% from the MPE acquisition. 2 of the 3 segments delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. The sales performance translated to strong earnings growth, with adjusted EBIT up 130 basis points to 13.5%, and adjusted earnings per share up 24% to $0.94.Moving to Chart 4, we will start on the segment details. Beginning with Aerospace & Defense, these businesses continued to deliver strong results. Beginning with orders, we achieved a 4% order growth in the quarter and finished with $562 million backlog, which represents an increase of $78 million since the beginning of the fiscal year.Moving on to sales, overall growth was 16%, which was all organic. The sales growth was led by strength from the commercial and defense aerospace businesses, which were up 14% and 20% respectively. The Navy businesses were also very strong in the quarter, delivering 32% growth.Adjusted EBIT margins in the quarter increased by 80 basis points as we saw nice leverage on the sales growth and favorable impacts from price, which were partially offset by inflation and mix.On Chart 5, we have the Utility Solutions Group. We had another great quarter here with orders. Orders were down in the quarter, which was driven by modest reductions at Doble and a larger decline at NRG. The renewables business saw exceptional order growth through June 30, of last year. The strong industry dynamics and government incentive programs spurred customer orders.Since then, the order pace has moderated and the business has burned down backlog. We are starting to see increasing order pipeline activity in the renewables business and we expect to see order growth return as we move beyond the third quarter.Sales for USG were up 10% in the second quarter with double digit increases for Doble and NRG. For Doble, we saw strong growth on the services side of the business and for NRG, we continue to see nice growth from solar.Adjusted EBIT margins were up 230 basis points as the business experienced favorable mix, nice leverage on sales growth, and price increases, which more than offset inflationary impacts.Next is Chart 6, where we have the Test business. Orders here decreased 21% compared to last year's second quarter. This was driven by lower orders from the U.S. wireless market and delays on a few large projects, which are expected to be booked in the third quarter. Despite the orders drop in the second quarter, you can see the backlog has still grown since the beginning of the year. This business continues to see good levels of activity, but as we mentioned last quarter, the timing to execute on some projects has been pushed out by customers, which is also driving lower sales levels.On the sales line, the business was down 8% with organic sales dropping by 12% and the MPE acquisition adding 4 points of growth. The largest declines came in the U.S. where we saw reductions in wireless filters and acoustic product lines. Adjusted EBIT margins declined to 12.2% in the quarter. As cost reduction efforts, we're not able to offset de-leverage on the sales drop.We have executed a plan to take cost out of this business, and this helped drive a nice sequential increase in profitability during the second quarter. We expect this sequential improvement to continue as we move through fiscal 2024.On Chart 7, we have the cash flow highlights. We continue to show favorability to last year with $19 million of operating cash flow so far this year compared to a cash use of $5.5 million last year. Favorability and accounts receivable was the main driver of the year-to-year improvement in operating cash flow.Capital spending in the first 6 months did increase driven by investments from the Aerospace & Defense businesses where we are working to increase capacity and productivity to support the robust demand outlook.You can also see that, we had acquisition spending in both years with MPE this year at just over 56 million while last year we had the CMT acquisition for approximately $18 million. We have completed $7 million of stock buybacks through March 31, of 2024, which compares to $12 million that was done through the first 6 months of last year.The last Chart today is #8, which is our 2024 guidance. The outlook for the full year remains unchanged, and we remain on track to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.15 to $4.30, which represents a growth range of 12% to 16%. This remains predicated on sales growth in the range of 7% to 9%.2024 shaping up to be another record year as we push to deliver revenue of more than $1 billion for the first time in ESCO history, and we push for a third year in a row of double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. That concludes the financial update, and now I'll turn it back over to Bryan."", 'Bryan H. Sayler', 'Thanks, Chris. Obviously, we delivered a very good Q2. The teams here at corporate and across our business segments did a great job in delivering exceptional top-line and bottom-line growth. There are always challenges when executing programs inside a business, and I continue to be impressed by the commitment and dedication shown by our employees around the world.As always, I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication, which resulted in another solid quarter for ESCO. To close, we have entrenched market positions across growing end markets, and we serve and remain on track to deliver our 2024 commitments for a third record year in a row.That concludes the opening remarks, and we can open-up the question-and-answer session.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tommy Moll of Stephens Inc.', 'Thomas Allen Moll', ""I wanted to start on Doble. I think orders were down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Revenues, if I'm doing my math correctly, were flattish on a quarter-over- quarter basis, and so the question would be if you could just give us an update on demand currently for that business?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""Sure. Listen, we still feel good about overall demand at Doble, and we did have very good tasks for orders in the prior year, but as you can see, we're moving the revenue up, seeing good demand for our condition monitoring products and for services. We do have a pretty robust order pipeline, and we've already begun to see some progress here in the third quarter."", 'Christopher L. Tucker', 'And, Tommy, this is Chris. I would also say, sequentially, the Doble sales were up from first quarter to second quarter. NRG was down slightly sequentially, but Doble was up inside of there.', 'Thomas Allen Moll', ""Thank you for clarifying there, Chris, and I just can't resist asking here, Bryan, you threw out a bogey high-single digits after your strategy review on the A&D side. Is there anything you want to use to frame the utility outlook after your review?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""Yes. I would say we're mid-upper single digits over the planning horizon there. Those are markets that are growing very well, and I think we've got strategies, plans, product development in place that's going to allow us to grow faster than those markets."", 'Thomas Allen Moll', ""And a quick one on Test. Chris, I think I heard you say you're looking for sequential improvement as you go through this year. I presume that applies to revenue and EBIT. It looks like revenue's already bottomed and moved a little bit higher, but if you could just clarify what you meant there, it would be helpful."", 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""Yes, that's right, Tommy. So, we had a sequential sales and EBIT increase from Q1 to Q2. We would expect Q3 sales to be higher than Q2, and also margins to be higher than Q2, and then we would expect a similar dynamic as Q4. So, we're kind of still looking for that business to kind of ramp and get better as each quarter progresses."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jonathan Tanwanteng of CJS Securities.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Justin on for Jon. Can you quantify how much risk there is at Boeing and if they've communicated to you any changes in their needs?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""Sure. Listen, Boeing is clearly having a tough time of it, and we certainly look closely at the impact that Boeing might have both in the near-term and over the longer term planning horizon during our strategic planning process. Our determination is that this is going to be a short-term problem that will work itself out over several quarters. Boeing's build rates are expected to remain modest for 2024 and begin ramping up in 2025. The signals that we're receiving are to continue to produce at the rates that we've been contracted to do so. We have seen a little bit of a fall off in new orders at one of our 3 businesses that are serving the commercial aerospace side of Boeing. Nothing to be too concerned about, but definitely a noticeable change.The good news is that we're prepared to match their demand as needed, and we have the ability to reallocate the capacity that would have been devoted to Boeing to other programs and to meet our projected growth rates.Listen, I'd end by saying, a healthy Boeing is good for our industry, and once they can get past this current crisis, we anticipate that that will serve to raise our overall growth projections."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""One more, if I could. Should we read anything into the lower book-to-bill this quarter across the segments? And if you think there's any demand weakening or pushing out, or is it more the lumpy nature of orders?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""I would say that, on the Test business, we've definitely seen lower orders in China and lower orders in wireless. So that would be -- I would not put that in the lumpy category, but I would say that renewables, maybe the global business, and certainly a lot of what's going on over in Aerospace & Defense, those are all pretty lumpy. As I said, we've got a strong pipeline in all of those categories, and some of them are tracking some pretty large orders that would really make a big difference in terms of our book-to-bills?"", 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""Yes, and I would just add on, especially Aerospace & Defense, it was still over 100%, and that's after 2 quarters that were way over 100% as we've had some pretty big Navy orders over the last prior5, 6 months, so really still pretty strong there, I'd say."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Franzreb from Sidoti & Co.', 'John Edward Franzreb', ""Congratulations on another nice quarter. If I heard you properly in your prepared remarks, it sounded like you were getting pricing in Utility and Tests. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of pricing you're pushing for?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', 'Do you want to take that one?', 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""Yes, I mean, I think generally what we're getting in those places is still kind of in the 3% to 4% range, and we see that kind of ahead of inflationary numbers, so we kind of try to track what we're seeing on the commodity material side and people inflation as well, and we're still favorable on those measures as far as more price than cost."", 'John Edward Franzreb', ""Got it. And coming back to the Test segment, you mentioned that there's been delays on a few large projects. I'm wondering, is there any common theme in those delays that you're seeing in your customers?"", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""Well, I think that there's been, as I said before, there's a general slowdown in the construction industry in terms of permitting, being able to get some key raw materials, and I think labor availability has been a big issue. So the buildings that we're waiting on are really large, big projects, and so we are seeing some improvement there, but nothing like a return to normal.At this point, though, we believe that we have the access that we need to deliver significant sequential growth in the second half of the year. The projects that are moved out to next year, we've kind of set those in the next year's plan now, and we anticipate that those will be executed on the revised schedule."", 'John Edward Franzreb', ""I'm also hearing a lot about permitting, but do you expect everything to fall into fiscal 2024 still and not be pushed to the right of that?"", 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""Yeah, I mean, we've already pushed a fair bit out to next year. That was kind of, some of the reduction in the outlook for Tests that we kind of did after the first quarter, and yes, we haven't seen that get worse necessarily, but we also haven't seen it get better. And I would also just say, John, that as far as some of the delays on orders and such, as Bryan mentioned, I mean, we do see a path to pretty big sequential improvement in orders as we go into Q3 versus Q4, and it looks like, frankly, some of that might even happen in April or has happened in April, I should say. So, we expect that to get better, but again, a lot of those bigger orders that would be coming in now would likely be more, kind of '25 revenue type things."", 'John Edward Franzreb', ""Great. And one last question, if I may. On the M&A front, can you kind of give us an update on targets and size and what kind of product lines you'd like to end? Maybe a little refresher, that'd be helpful."", 'Bryan H. Sayler', ""Sure. Well, first of all, I would say that in the past, since our last call, we've seen a sharp increase in the investment opportunities that kind of meet our target profile, if you will, and we're actively engaged in those processes. We don't have anything to announce. We're not, you know, particularly close, but we are optimistic about our ability to get things done.When we talk about M&A, I think the first thing I want to remind you is that, organic growth and operational execution are our primary focus, so we're not taking our eye off the ball there. Our organic growth profile over the planning process is really, really good. Having said that, several of those end markets that we talked about earlier have superior long-term growth characteristics, and those are the ones that we would be -- the most focused on, and that would be, commercial and military aerospace, Navy, and electrification."", 'Operator', 'I see no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Bryan.', 'Bryan H. Sayler', 'Thanks. I apologize. I lost my place here.', 'Christopher L. Tucker', ""No, I think. We're good."", 'Bryan H. Sayler', 'All right. So, thanks a lot, guys. We really appreciate you answering the questions or taking the quick questions with us. We look forward to another good quarter.', 'Christopher L. Tucker', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.""]"

It's harder to find beaten-down stocks that still look worth buying and holding onto for a while. Some corporations are condemned to deliver subpar financial results and stock market performances practically in perpetuity."", ""Thankfully, Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)\xa0and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), two drugmakers that are failing to keep pace with broader equities, arguably don't belong to that group. Though these corporations have recently faced issues, there remain excellent reasons to invest in them for the long haul. Let's dig in deeper to see why."", ""In the first quarter, Bristol Myers' revenue of $11.9 billion increased by 5% year over year. That's a decent, though not particularly impressive, performance for a pharmaceutical giant. However, it's worth pointing out that the company's year-over-year top-line growth was in the red for several quarters."", ""Bristol Myers dealt with some important patent cliffs, but it seems to be turning the corner, partly thanks to its portfolio of newer medicines. However, the drugmaker isn't out of the woods just yet. Cancer drug Opdivo is one of the company's top-selling products, but it will run out of patent protection by 2028. Bristol Myers should be able to handle this issue, too."", ""Its newer portfolio comprises medicines that have been approved since 2019 and could generate about $25 billion in revenue by 2030. Most of them should see their sales growing well into the 2030s. Further, Bristol Myers has a plan to counter Opdivo's sales decline after it hits its patent cliff. The company is developing a subcutaneous version of the medicine, which, it expects, could address between 65% to 75% of Opdivo's indications."", 'Bristol Myers should also earn approval for even more brand-new products. Its pipeline features 55 compounds. So, the drugmaker should be just fine over the long run even if it may take some patience before the company fully bounces back. One more reason to buy the stock: Bristol Myers offers quite a decent dividend program. Its forward yield sits at 5.46%, and it has increased its payouts by some 46% over the past five years.', 'Despite underperforming the market of late, dividend investors should love this stock.', ""Pfizer's top line is dropping off a cliff. In the first quarter, the company's revenue of $14.9 billion was down 20% year over year."", ""However, the drugmaker's situation is a bit different than Bristol Myers'. Pfizer's Comirnaty and Paxlovid haven't run out of patent protection, but with the pandemic receding, neither product is generating nearly as much in sales as it did in 2021 and 2022 or even last year. That's why Pfizer's shares have failed to keep pace over the past two years."", ""Here's the good news. Pfizer's coronavirus-related work was a net benefit for the company. The drugmaker's relatively small investment in developing COVID-19 products paid off for itself several times over. Pfizer became the first company in the history of the biopharma industry to generate $100 billion in annual revenue, money that allowed it to splurge on acquisitions and substantially improve its pipeline."", ""That's already paying off. Pfizer launched several brand-new products last year, including Abrysvo, a vaccine for the respiratory syncytial virus, and Litfulo, a therapy for an autoimmune disease called alopecia areata, among others. But Pfizer is far from done. The company currently has 113 programs in its pipeline."", 'The company is well-positioned to bounce back from its recent poor stock market performances and deliver solid returns over the long run. Pfizer is also a decent dividend stock. Its payouts have increased by just under 17% in the past five years and boast a forward yield of 6.04%.

It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$3.4b were what the analysts expected, Fox surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$1.40 per share, an impressive 46% above what was forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Fox ', ""Following the latest results, Fox's 21 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$15.1b in 2025. This would be a meaningful 8.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 8.0% to US$3.60. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.54 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$36.85, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Fox, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$62.00 and the most bearish at US$29.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Fox's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 6.9% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.7% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.3% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Fox to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Fox analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Fox (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you need to take into consideration."", 'Have feedback on this article?

One particular business just brought in a new CEO last year. Shareholders have probably been wondering how progress has been.', ""The company I'm talking about is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). It recently reported its first-quarter financial results."", ""Lately, it's been getting attention on Wall Street for the wrong reasons. This fintech stock has been a disappointment, as its shares are currently 78% cheaper than their all-time high. But is it a good long-term investment option?"", ""I thought PayPal's latest quarterly update gave shareholders reasons to be optimistic about the state of the business. Alex Chriss, the CEO who is aiming to boost growth and profitability, is doing a good job so far."", 'During the quarter, PayPal reported a 9% year-over-year revenue increase, the fastest growth rate since Q3 2022. This was driven by an impressive 14% gain in total payment volume, which totaled a whopping $404 billion in the three months. This massive sum clearly indicates that PayPal remains a dominant force in the digital payments space.', 'One of Chriss\' objectives from the start has been to drive greater efficiencies across the organization. ""We are instilling a rigorous cost benefit discipline throughout the company and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs,"" he said on the Q1 2024 earnings call. There\'s already been progress on this front: PayPal\'s operating margin expanded from 14.2% in the year-ago quarter to 15.2% today.', ""There's also a renewed focus on prioritizing customers' needs and boosting innovation and product development. Investors will likely cheer at PayPal's attempt to leverage artificial intelligence throughout its various payment and financial services products, particularly when it comes to fraud detection, something merchants really value."", ""Despite the positive results, the market hasn't been kind to PayPal shareholders, as evidenced by a stock price that has dropped 11% in the past 12 months. There are some possible reasons for this."", ""For starters, PayPal's user base has flatlined in the past couple of years. As of March 31, 2024, the business counted 427 million active customers, which is down 2 million compared to Q1 2022. The positive spin on this, though, is that these users are more engaged, initiating more transactions."", ""However, the lack of account growth points to intensifying competition. We can't ignore the rise of popular digital wallet providers like Apple Pay and Alphabet's Google Pay, as well as compelling merchant-focused payment businesses like Adyen and Stripe.

today's deal is telling us that, you know, under this new management regime which has seen, I think what's transformative here is the relationship that they built with their partners in, in including in the FDA, who are allowing them to have a path, you know, which is very streamlined when it comes to having a variant based vaccine."", ""But I think I'm sure you are interested in also

allows us to drive growth.', 'Now, as you just mentioned, there are potentially other products or at least other combinations coming down the pike here.', 'But you know what does the future growth trajectory look like for Nova backs?', 'Yeah, I mean if you if you take a step back on on the size of the market of the opportunity we are talking about.', 'And if you just look at flu and, and take out the pandemic from the picture, you know, we were vaccinating roughly uh north of, you know, 50 to 60 million uh adults every year and a large majority of them were and elderly, right, the vaccination rates tend to be higher on that.', 'So if you think about that market is at least what you would look to protect.', 'And um there is obviously a data, you know, as, as you might, as you guys are aware that Nova was working on a, a flu vaccine before COVID even came along and they had positive phase three results.', ""So what today's uh update and development does is actually bring that back almost from the uh uh ashes to be able to develop as a stand alone vaccine, a flu vaccine."", 'Uh And then uh the combination points up uh vaccine would be in addition to that stand-alone flu vaccine.', ""So again, it's, it's a little unclear how the market would segment out which uh parts of the population would only prefer flu and not uh you know, take a COVID combination."", ""But I think we'll see the guidelines in the medical professional bodies."", ""You know, the recommendations around uh having protection for both and, and if safety and efficacy and importantly, immunogenicity, which we've seen already on a stand alone basis from the COVID vaccine for NOVA and also from the flu vaccine."", ""Uh there's a very high likelihood of success for them to hit on this phase three trial, they're looking to execute and then in terms of the market opportunity uh and especially in a premium segment market or elderly market where it's a little unclear how the MRN A

to comment on activist uh situations, but I think just at the highest level, it, it it was, I think directionally uh pointing to the things that the management was already working on and today's deal actually confirms that, right, like one of the uh uh recommendations or uh you know, ask for the, for the management was to engage in a process or engage with a credible partner that we have in Sanofi that they, you know, they've been working on for several months deals like these don't come together as you know, overnight."", ""So I think that maybe that urgency to act or deliberation was uh you know, catalyzed by having an activist uh uh interfere, but clearly management had been uh you know, we looking at some of these strategic options for a little while and, and as you know, over the past year, they've uh cut cost uh you know, right size the organization and they continue to do that into the, into next year."", 'So um getting that balance sheet uh situ uh you know, uh issue that they had to uh get over was already in the works and, and um and, and execution related issues that were, I think also pointed out uh from regulatory standpoint, from a commercial standpoint.', ""Those

picture.', 'Chad your take on the consumer and, and where they are right now, it was just sort of interesting to walk through this earnings season and try to read the tea leaves um just where you thought they were.', 'Uh so some executives, I I actually was impressed when I heard something like like Uber and Lyft and how generally optimistic they sound the consumer.', 'But what was your take so broad based?', 'I think that the consumer is quite strong.', 'Uh They, well, they, they got a lot of tailwind regarding savings, uh wage inflation has been going higher that bodes well for consumption uh as well as a full employment picture here in the United States.', 'Uh So for us, we think that it bodes well, overall in aggregate or big box retailers, of course, there are certain retailers that will do much better and then there are others that are going to lapse doing in part because of the big post COVID surge.', 'The normalization cycle is around the corner.', 'Well, maybe on that front, Chris, I wanna bring you in.', ""Uh, you know, I think that the Walmart's the world more squarely fit into our idea of what value the value proposition is right now."", 'Maybe we struggle a little bit more with the Home Improvement retailers which I know you cover as well.', ""Talking about Home Depot and Lowe's, I think you have a buy rating on both."", 'How, how do they fit in into this current consumer environment?', 'Yeah, I I and I think the multi year strategy is that there is a huge portion of the population who has locked in very low mortgage rates.', ""Uh We've seen in the housing numbers that they're not moving."", 'So maybe a lot of people you also have uh baby boomers who are aging in place and you have a large number of millennials who you know, are going to buy a house.', ""Uh but it's probably not going to be the house they dreamed of."", ""And I think all of that spells Home Improvement, the baby boomers are gonna upgrade homes so that they, they can stay longer, whether it's showers or baths, um or railings or other things."", ""Uh a lot of people who are saying, you know, we've got a low mortgage, we're going to stay in our house."", ""They're probably gonna do kitchens and bathrooms and all kinds of things to make their existing home more livable."", 'So, you know, there may be a couple of near term challenges but, but longer term, I think, I think it makes a lot of sense.', ""Well, that's what I wanted to follow up on Chris."", ""You know, what you're describing, that sort of longer term trend?"", 'Are we gonna see that in the upcoming earnings or is that more just something investors should kind of ride out and wait for?', ""I mean, they, they're good quality businesses, they, they pay dividends."", ""Um, and the thing is, I don't think we know exactly when the turn is going to be and, and the other thing is like, all we need to see is a little bit of sign of an inflection."", ""So I think the long term thesis makes a lot of sense looking at the, you know, Harvard's leading indicator of remodeling activity."", ""It's probably later in the year before we, before we see a turn there."", ""But, I mean, I think it's a thesis that makes a lot of sense."", ""And, um, I think the businesses are, you know, are going to weather that and if the change, whether it's from the Fed or somewhere else happens a little

that name you're saying, listen, um some short term headwinds but longer term smart place to be right."", 'And I completely agree with Chris, uh when it comes to Home Depot, uh we own it in our rising dividend portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over five years."", 'It, it has very little debt.', ""Uh, it is consistently growing and, uh when it comes to profitability, it's, it's has a high return on invested capital, capital."", 'Uh, and like Chris, I echo that you want to own this as a core position over the next 3 to 5 years.', 'When that turn comes in the housing market, uh this stock will gap higher.', 'Uh So, uh, we would be a buyer within that, uh within uh uh with, with Home Depot.', ""Um Let's chat."", ""Let's get to then the others, the, the Walmarts and targets that are coming up as well."", ""Um Do you, uh, I'll take you first on this chat."", 'Do you like one over the other?', 'Do you think those are both gonna provide um, a go a good opportunity for investors, especially with the catalyst of the upcoming earnings as well.', 'Yeah, we, we like and we favor Walmart.', 'We have it in both our rising dividends and all c portfolio.', ""We've owned it for over over seven years."", 'We believe that their their diversification in regard to omni channel has been quite successful.', ""They're now able to compete, I believe, head on with Amazon."", 'So we favor that one over target.', 'If there is a softening within the consumption, consumer or consumption, we think that Walmart will be able to take market share from Target Chris.', 'I wanna get you back in here.',

over the last several months in lowering the prices of things like French bread and rotisserie chicken at times where people are concerned about prices."", 'You know, they, they look to Walmart as a place that can help.', ""Uh, the other thing we've seen is that, you know, households that make over $100,000 a year are going to Walmart."", ""So when this change or when it's a little bit of turn with the consumer happens, Walmart's gonna try to retain those customers."", ""Uh, they're investing in their, their discretionary stuff, their home products and that should be good for them."", ""Um, you know, the, the question I think clients, others ask is, you know, we see the case for, for Walmart right now, but what's the next step, whether it's three or six months down the road?"", ""And I think it's a little bit similar to what we were saying with, with home Depot, uh, Target has, uh, more of a discretionary business and, you know, I think when we see that turn, I mean, in the meantime, they, they still have, um, you know, staples and they still have decent traffic and they're still, you know, appealing to people who want convenience."", 'But I think once their, um, their home and apparel comes back in a stronger way, we should see that go right to margins.', 'Chris Chad.', 'Thank you guys both for joining the show today.', 'Have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.',

In the last decade, there’s been a whole roster of motion pictures or limited series about tech companies that have appeared on the big screen: From WeWork and Theranos to Uber and Facebook.', 'One of the storylines you can expect to see next is PayPal. Jack Selby, one of PayPal’s original employees who now runs Peter Thiel’s family office, and David Sacks, another member of the “PayPal Mafia” who runs the VC firm Craft Ventures, purchased the film rights this year to one of the books about PayPal, and are in the early innings of planning the production. Both of them have a background in film, with Sacks coproducing Thank You for Smoking, and Selby behind titles like Bernie and Silk Road.', ""“I've been trying to figure out which characters we want to focus on the most,” Selby told me on stage yesterday at the Midcon VC Summit in Bentonville, Ark. “People like Elon [Musk] and Peter and Reid [Hoffman] and David himself—these are people that are really well known in the tech world. So we’re trying to figure out which characters we want to tease out and really run with.”"", 'Selby said he “make[s] films to make money,” so he’s trying to gauge whether there’s room in the “Silicon Valley genre” for a success story, rather than the rise-and-fall storylines that have performed so well—and what pieces of the story they’ll need to focus on to keep things interesting. He also openly questioned on stage whether the genre is too saturated now, and whether people are “tired of hearing about Silicon Valley people.”', 'PayPal is a story of lore within tech circles—a group of twenty- and thirty-somethings that built a global payments startup and sold it to eBay for more than $1.5 billion in less than four years. Of course, there’s a lot of drama to the story, too. Elon Musk, while on his honeymoon in Australia, was famously pushed out of the company in a “coup” and replaced by Thiel.', 'But part of what makes PayPal’s story most intriguing—the success that its cast of characters went on to experience afterward—won’t easily translate on screen. Hoffman went on to cofound LinkedIn and later joined VC firm Greylock. Thiel cofounded Palantir and opened Founders Fund. Sacks cofounded Craft Ventures. Max Levchin, another PayPal original, founded Affirm while yet another, Roelof Botha, now runs Sequoia Capital. All of this was pointed out in a historic Fortune story in 2007 that coined “PayPal Mafia” for the first time.', 'The book Sacks and Selby bought the rights to is The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley, written by former Huffington Post managing editor Jimmy Soni and published in 2021. Selby says that Soni spent five years interviewing people close to PayPal and that it is “very true” (Elon “definitely sat with Jimmy probably more than any of us,” Selby added).', 'But a question I have is whether its producers are too close to the story and its cast of characters to tell it like it was—rather than how they hope it will be remembered. I also wonder what Elon Musk will ultimately think of the finished product. His ouster at PayPal (which Selby said on stage he was not involved in) was contentious. Musk’s relationships with many of the people seem to have been repaired over the years (Founders Fund has backed Musk’s SpaceX to Neuralink, for example). But it’s hard to believe Musk is fully over it when, just last year, he renamed Twitter after the name he had lobbied for PayPal all those years ago: X.', 'Right now, Selby said that he and Sacks are working with musical artist Drake on the film and that they’re considering three different routes: A scripted series that would appear on HBO or Netflix, a full-length motion picture, or a documentary. As for who will star in it, and when it will actually run—if it runs at all—is still in the works.', '“I have literally no idea,” Selby said of the timing.', 'More news below.', 'Jessica Mathews', 'Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 11.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share, indicating a change of +0.5% from the year-ago quarter.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.63 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1%.

The groundbreaking art practice was cultivated by direct descendants of slaves in rural Alabama who have faced oppression, geographic isolation and intense material constraints.', 'As of this year, their improvisational art has also come to embody a very modern question: What happens when distinctive cultural tradition collides with corporate America?', ""Enter Target. The retailer launched a limited-edition collection based on the quilters' designs for Black History Month this year. Consumer appetites proved to be high as many stores around the country sold out of the checkered sweaters, water bottles and faux-quilted blankets."", '“We’re actually in a quilt revival right now, like in real time,” says Sharbreon Plummer, an artist and scholar. “They’re so popularized, and Target knew that. It created the biggest buzz when it came out.” Indeed, there has been a resurgence of interest among Gen Z and millennials in conscious consumption and the homemade — with “cottagecore” style, baking bread, DIY bracelets — but both are at odds with the realities of fast fashion.', ""The Target designs were “inspired by” five Gee's Bend quilters who reaped limited financial benefits from the collection’s success. They received a flat rate for their contributions rather than pay proportionate to Target’s sales. A spokesperson for Target wouldn’t share sales numbers from the collection but confirmed that it indeed sold out in many stores."", ""Unlike the pay structure of the Freedom Quilting Bee of the 1960s — an artist-run collective that disbursed payment equitably to Gee's Bend quilters, who were salaried and could set up Social Security benefits — one-off partnerships with companies like Target benefit only a small number of people, in this case five women from two families."", ""The maxim “representation matters” is not new, but it's gaining wider traction. Still, when visibility for some doesn't translate into meaningful change for a marginalized community as a whole, how is that reconciled?"", 'A HISTORY OF OUTSIDERS', '”Every stage of the finances has been problematic,” says Patricia Turner, a retired professor in World Arts and Culture and African American Studies at UCLA who traced the commodification of Gee\'s Bend quilts back to the white collector Bill Arnett in the 1990s. “I’m really bothered by Target\'s in-house designer manipulating the look of things to make it more palatable for their audience,"" she says of the altered color palettes and patterns.', 'Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo said that quilters had the opportunity to provide input on multiple occasions throughout the process.', '“We worked with five quilters from The Quilters of Gee’s Bend on a variety of limited-time only items,"" he wrote in an emailed statement. “As is standard with limited-time collections at Target, each quilter was paid a discussed and agreed upon fee for their services. As outlined in our contracts, Target had the right to make final design decisions, however, with the goal of honoring their storied heritage, the process was highly collaborative.”', ""While thumbnail-size photos of the makers appeared on some marketing materials and the text “Gee's Bend” was printed on clothing tags, the company's engagement with the quilters was limited. As soon as Black History Month ended, the quilters' names and images were scrubbed from the retailer's site."", 'Target has pledged to spend more than $2 billion on Black-owned businesses by 2025.', 'The situation today mirrors that of the 1990s, when some quilters enjoyed newfound visibility, others were disinterested and still others felt taken advantage of. (In 2007, several quilters brought a series of lawsuits against the Arnett family, but all cases were settled out of court and little is known about the suits because of nondisclosure agreements.)', ""The profit-oriented approach that emerged, which disrupted the Quilting Bee's price-sharing structure, created “real rifts and disharmony within the community,” Turner explains, over engaging with collectors, art institutions and commercial enterprises. “To have those bonds disrupted over the commercialization of their art form, I think, is sad.”"", 'REPRODUCING ART OUT OF CONTEXT', 'Quilts are made to mark major milestones and are gifted to celebrate a new baby or a marriage, or to honor someone’s loss. Repurposing fabric — from tattered blankets, frayed rags, stained clothes — is a central ethos of the community’s quilting practice, which resists commodification. But the Target collection was mass-produced from new fabrics in factories in China and elsewhere overseas.', ""The older generations of Gee's Bend quilters are known for one-of-a-kind designs with clashing colors and irregular, wavy lines — visual effects borne of their material constraints. Most worked at night in houses without electricity and didn't have basic tools like scissors, let alone access to fabric stores. Stella Mae Pettway, who has sold her quilts on Etsy for $100 to $8,000, has characterized having scissors and access to more fabrics now as a paradox of “advantage and a disadvantage.”"", ""Many third- and fourth-generation artists returned to quilting as adults for a creative and therapeutic outlet, as well as a tether to their roots. After her mom died in 2010, quilter JoeAnn Pettway-West revisited the practice and found peace in completing her mother’s unfinished quilts. “As I’m making this stitch, I can just see her hand, stitching. It’s like, we’re there together,” she says. “It's a little bit of her, a little bit of me.”"", 'Delia Pettway Thibodeaux is a third-generation Gee’s Bend quilter whose grandmother was a sharecropper and whose bold, rhythmic quilts are now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s permanent collection. For the Target collection, she received a flat fee rather than a rate proportional to sales.', '“I was kind of concerned in the beginning” about how quilts would be altered to fit with the collection, Pettway Thibodeaux says. “But then again when I saw the collection, I felt different.”', 'Claudia Pettway Charley, a Gee’s Bend quilter and a community manager at Nest, a nonprofit, said in an emailed statement that the collaboration was “a great way to make our designs accessible” to a wide audience.', '“We had no idea how large this campaign would be and what it would mean to our community,” she said.', 'LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION', ""Because job opportunities are so limited in Gee's Bend, many fourth-generation quilters have left the area to take jobs as teachers, day care workers, home health aides, and to serve in the military."", '“We, as the next generation, we was more dreamers,” Pettway-West says.', ""National recognition has certainly brought some positive change. But more visibility — from museum exhibitions, academic research, a U.S. Postal Service stamp collection — hasn't necessarily translated into economic gains. After all, the average annual income in Boykin, Alabama, is still far below the poverty rate at about $12,000, according to the nonprofit Nest."", '“This is a community that still, to this day, really needs recognition, still needs economic revitalization,"" says Lauren Cross, Gail-Oxford Associate Curator of American Decorative Arts at The Huntington Museum of Art. ""And so any economic opportunities that, you know, funnel back to them, I support.""', ""Target’s line in particular, though, is disconnected from the group’s origins and handmade practice, she says. It's a problem that distills the very challenge at hand when something handcrafted and linked to deep tradition goes national and corporate."", '“On one hand you want to preserve the stories and that sense of authenticity,"" Cross says.', '""And on the other hand,"" she asks, “how do you reach a broader audience?”']"

that second quarter GDP got revised down to 3.3%.', 'It does seem like the higher rate policy is starting to impact the economy on the margin.', ""And from our standpoint that actually, um, set, sets up the best drop for a possible rate cut and, and honestly can't tell you whether it's going to be June or September."", ""But Chairman Powell was pretty clear in saying that it's a very high bar to

my exact question there."", 'And then building further upon that, when we talk about the shift that we have seen to these defensive plays.', 'It sounds like it might just be a rotation into those that had underperformed here since the start of the year.', 'What does that though?', 'Tell us about the likely action and the likely allocation that we will see in terms of market leadership from here on

those that I mentioned."", ""And by the way there, those seem uh we're getting the benefit of that growth in even in a high rate environment."", ""So, um I think the market's been incredibly resilient uh given the uncertainty over interest rates and that resilience has translated into investors um not taking a defensive posture."", 'Um And yes, there has been a little bit of catch up as you noted um with the broader market sort of trying to catch up to the to the highly concentrated uh big holdings at the top of the S and P 500.', ""But I mean, those companies are still doing really well, whether it's, you know, on Amazon Microsoft or NVIDIA, they're, they're putting up some very impressive numbers and um and investors are, are staying invested in those names."", 'Many investors are

and P and the NASDAQ, that consumer sentiment print, which is very interesting to me."", 'I would have thought that the consumer feeling less good about the economy would potentially be a sign of the markets kind of questioning what the fed was going to do with the rates here.', 'But we are seeing the move to the upside moving forward for the markets here.', 'All right.', 'Looking at gold futures on track for its best week since early April as rate cut hopes are lifting medals across the board for more.', 'We want to bring in Bob.', 'I, you know, a path trading partners, co founder and chief market strategist, Bob.', ""It's great to see you and talk to me just about this rally."", ""What's called a rally that we've seen in gold this week, we certainly have seen gains in terms of how much upside momentum is left because you talk about the fact that clearly the feds uh path forward here is driving and influencing the price of gold."", 'But you also got the central banks around the world buying gold and not being a real driver here.', ""So then what does that upside look like if there's any?"", 'Well to your point according to the world Gold Council, largest purchases ever by central banks.', 'Largest purchases on record, I guess in 700 BC, maybe a central bank then could have bought more.', 'But for the record that we have first quarter largest central bank purchases.', 'So we have that the second thing we have is what I believe to be a reflation narrative just generally across the economy.', 'And people think gold is an inflation hedge.', 'It is not what gold is, is a store of value or an asset.', ""Anywhere you store money is an asset, your home land, the stock market Now that doesn't mean they come without risk, downside risk."", 'All of those just mentioned do and gold does as well to a certain degree.', 'Bitcoin is a high beta store of value.', 'Gold is the same.', 'And if inflation is picking up again, which I believe it is gold will rally as a function of asset inflation.', 'We all complain about inflation.', 'I do as well.', 'I bought a bunch of stakes yesterday really pissed me off.', 'But when you look at asset inflation that comes with it, those of us that own assets like gold, we benefit from that.', 'So my target for gold is about 4.8% higher from here.', 'Very specific 2491.', 'If you get to 2491 the speculator will probably push it to 2500 just because they like those numbers.', 'So sticking with gold there.', ""I'm curious, the Chinese Central Bank is slowing its purchases of gold."", 'I wonder to what extent stateside buyers of gold?', 'The people.', 'Brian Si loves to talk about going to Costco getting those gold bars.', 'Do they need to worry about that slowdown from foreign central banks?', ""That's funny."", ""That's where I got my stakes."", ""They don't need to do that as long as we're going to get this fed rate cut."", ""I I'm, you know, my job as a strategist is to figure out what's going to happen."", 'Not what the fed should do or what markets should do.', ""But what they're going to do, I think the fed is going to cut rates, the probabilities are rising of that just based on market pricing."", ""Uh I'm sorry, cut rates."", 'Did I say raise cut rates?', ""And if they do that will boost gold because the only time that gold suffers in an inflationary environment which I believe we're still in and we're probably getting a little bit of an uptick on that is if the fed is fighting inflation."", 'And right now, the rhetoric is pivoted to the opposite of that.', ""So despite central banks slowing China being the main one, as you mentioned, Madison, I don't think that's going to slow gold all that much."", ""It's just going to slow the rise, but I think the rise will still be in place, Bob."", ""How are you looking at the pickup and buying that we've seen in silver and a lot of that on the back of this rally that we've seen in gold?"", ""Yeah, that gold silver ratio can really widen out, but it really is sort of a a tug on the rope from gold and it's sort of an elastic rope, right?"", 'Silver will snap back.', ""Silver gets looked at by a lot of speculators and people who want to store in precious metals as the poor person's gold."", ""For lack of a better phrase, my biggest losing trades have been in silver and simply because I don't understand the juxtaposition well enough between the industrial properties of silver and the precious properties of silver and which one dominates when."", ""However, in a reflation narrative, when you're starting to see us PM is manufactured PM, I specifically go back into expansion territory."", ""Silver's now benefiting from both of them."", ""Again, I'm not in it because uh if I get in silver, it'll be a losing trade."", ""That's just the way it's been."", ""But from that perspective, I think silver's playing catch up, but also benefiting from the environment that we're in because of that dual nature of it."", 'Right.', ""Well, it's interesting because you are missing out on some of those big gains here to date unfortunately, for you, Bob, but I am not the first time for many of the investors who chat with us, but I'm curious, we're not, we're not seeing a lot of the traditional hedging activity that you think of."", ""When you think about investors who are concerned about the momentum of a market, we're not seeing people buying volatility, for example, with the V, why is gold a better hedge?"", ""Well, I don't know that it is a better hedge again, I think what it is is a lower risk asset that could benefit from inflation and reflation."", ""So really, I don't know that it is a better hedge for equities falling."", 'It may not be at this point.', ""But if equities were to drop, then you're likely to see the fed cut more aggressively and that would benefit gold simply on dollar weakness."", 'Gold has probably four factors that move it in the short to medium term.', 'Three of those in my view are pointing to gold being higher.', ""Now, I'm not, I own gold."", 'Full disclosure.', ""I've owned it since November 2022."", ""So I don't want anyone to take that and run with it so that my trade gets better."", ""I just think when I analyze it, there's only one way that gold comes out in the negative and that's if inflation spikes and the fed decides to tighten and fight it, gold will suffer then and I don't really see that happening in the near future."", ""All right, Bob, we're gonna have to leave it there."", 'Thank you so much for joining us.', 'We really appreciate it.', 'That was Bob.', 'I aino of path trading partners joining us.', ""We're watching Moderna shares after, after the company announcing that the FDA has delayed the approval of its RSV vaccine to the end of May."", 'Yahoo finances, Angeli Kni joining us now with the latest on.', ""That's right guys."", ""So uh the FDA let Moderna know that even though they were supposed to have a decision by this weekend for that RSV vaccine, they're going to have to delay it due to administrative constraints until the end of May."", ""Now this doesn't fully throw the approval process off track."", 'The C is still on, on track to get to their portion of the approval process in June.', ""So it doesn't totally throw off the timeline, but it does put a little wrench in the overall timeline for modern, which has been waiting to get this product to market to make it the second product that it gets revenues out of."", 'So that is the only concern for this right now.', ""While it doesn't throw off the entire process, it does put sort of a, a little little tiny dark cloud over Moderna for the day."", 'All right.', 'Um Thanks so much for breaking down that story for us and certainly a trade here that uh investors should continue to watch.', ""All right, let's also take a look at a company that's making its public debut here in the US today."", 'A Chinese EV maker set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange.', 'Ziker will be the first major Chinese EV maker to go public since Xang and Lee O went public just about four years ago.', 'The carmaker set to sell 21 million shares are priced at 21 bucks a share after the close last night, last night pricing at the top end of the range.', ""I'm taking a look right now at the latest developments that we're getting looks like it's indicated to open right around 23 to $25 a share here."", ""We're waiting for the opening trade here of Ziker."", 'But Mattie, we bring this up in the context of what this means for so many other companies that are already within this space.', 'Obviously, specifically Tesla is the name that comes to top of mind for many people.', 'When you think about another competitor here within this space and now going public, the real threat is viewed at least to Tesla and Zieger posing that huge competition.', ""In a recent interview, their CEO was saying that their sales gap with Tesla keeps narrowing was very optimistic about the company's plans to expand in Europe and in Latin America this year."", 'So that also just speaks to that competition side of the story.', 'And then you also can talk about the pricing and exactly what that ultimately means for so many of these larger US auto giants here in the US as well.', ""Well, it's really interesting that you bring up the pricing wars because Zer is going to be impacted by this announcement from the Biden administration expecting to put tariffs on Chinese S and those automakers there."", ""Now, the parent company of Zer has previously indicated that they're going to subscribe to 90% of the stock indicating that there's a little bit of stress coming into this."", ""IP and that's no surprise given that this, we've got this news from the Biden administration today."", 'It was probably a good move for them, given that those geopolitical tensions between China and the US are headwinds that are unpredictable and that are unfortunately going we for them unfortunately going to weigh on the stock as the IP O today.', 'So see some stress across the board there.', 'But staying in the electric vehicle space here, we are going to move on to our next guest in this space, Tesla, Ceo Elon Musk Post on X saying Tesla will spend over $500 million expanding the supercharger network to create thousands of new chargers this year.', ""This comes after the electric vehicle maker laid off the employees who ran the EV charging team to break down what's next for Tesla?"", 'We have Mike Ramsey Garner, automotive analyst, Mike, thank you so much for joining us this morning.', 'Listen, we got great news to talk to you about so plenty to dive into.', 'I mean, talk to me about this.', 'You turn from Elon Musk, what do you make of it?', 'But I mean, actually, to be honest with you, this announcement makes more sense than the layoffs do.', ""Um The Super Charter network has been one of the most important assets that Tesla's had in terms of differentiating it between the other automakers and why buy a Tesla and they just spent the last year essentially getting all of the other automakers in the United States to switch over to the type of charging plug that they use."", 'And by doing that, they actually open up that network to become a significant source of new revenue.', 'So the layoffs, maybe that is a uh you know, cost optimization effort as they try to, to get their operations in line.', 'But the investment in the network actually makes a lot of sense um and might be a real benefit to them in the long term as a new source of revenue.', 'How long does something like this do you think take to build out what is the timeline look like?', 'Given?', ""Obviously, they clearly have experience, but they're almost starting from scratch in a sense."", ""Yeah, there's a, there are a lot of things that go into it."", ""Obviously, you need to work with utilities um to make sure that there's enough high power connection to these sites."", 'And uh you also have to uh get the real estate that is in the right place.', ""So, I mean, to build out $500 million worth of infrastructure is probably a good solid couple of years of, of work, but they do know what they're doing and, and I promise you that they've already done the real estate scouting for almost every spot in the United States at least uh to find the best locations for superchargers."", 'Well, this announcement from Tesla coming after BP was very excited to try and pick up some of the ev charging real estate in the US left behind by Tesla after those layoffs.', 'Does BP stand a chance here?', 'Yeah.', ""Listen, I mean, i it's, it's not exactly like the um liquid fuel refueling market, but especially at the beginning, it was very different, but as we mature and these superchargers, meaning like really fast chargers, they are a lot closer to that market."", ""I do think that there's gonna be more parallels and just like there's more than one oil company and there's more than one set of retailers."", ""Um Once everybody starts using the same plug, then there's, there's room for everyone to compete in this market."", ""Let's talk about one of the other uh big question marks that's hanging over the heads of a lot of investors in Tesla."", 'It has to do with their automated driving, their full self driving.', 'And Elon Musk was out earlier this week last night saying that he is actually saying that the cyber truck full self driving is only a few months way.', 'How realistic do you think that timeline is and, and just give us your sense just of where Tesla stands within this race in uh full uh driving here and self driving here and, and what exactly that ultimately means here for the space at large?', ""Yeah, it's really important too."", ""And I, I think this is very hard for people to, to get their head around because Tesla's autopilot and their full self driving software works pretty well."", 'And to most of us, we think you get behind the wheel and it can do a lot of automated functions.', ""You think this is a self driving vehicle, it's not ok."", ""This what they are charging for, what they're charging customers for is a uh partially automated system that is more like a convenience feature."", 'It is not a self driving vehicle, like something that Waymo is offering in uh the Southeast United States and in San Francisco.', ""So when Tesla talks about this service improving and rolling out, they are not really playing in the same field, as many of the I would say, fully autonomous Robocop type providers are playing, that said their system keeps getting better and better and they can make money selling it because it's a nice feature and that people like to have."", ""Um and they promised Tesla has promised that uh in August, they're gonna unveil their new robo uh that couldn't, you know, essentially be a full self driving vehicle."", 'My expectation is that vehicle will not be the same thing that you and I can buy or even the cyber truck, full self driving.', 'This will be a vehicle that has a lot more equipment on it, more computers, more sensors, things that are not part of a standard Tesla self driving vehicle.', 'So Mike just taking a step back.', 'One thing that confuses me about the challenges that Tesla has faced is that Elon is in a world where this technology is existent

about Tesla's approach that is different than those other competitors in the space."", ""That could be the reason they're a little bit behind."", ""Well, I think that they've always done the same thing, which is they want a low cost high volume approach."", ""So they're looking at it like, hey, how can we get this system into the hands of as many people as possible?"", 'Using the cheapest equipment as possible at scale and then try to, I wanna say crowd source data and behavior to keep improving our system.', 'That, that that way of doing it where it can, it can provide a system to you

Tesla?', 'Yeah, I mean, I I definitely think that there is potential for um Tesla to continue to struggle in China and the if there are additional tariffs put on them, it could, it could definitely affect them.', ""That said, I think that Tesla's bigger problem in China is that the Chinese automakers continue to get better and better and they can offer lower priced vehicles that are very competitive."", 'Um And unlike in this market where Tesla really is a dominant player in China, there are a lot of good players, you mentioned one, Zika is just one of many that are offering evs in

your sense of how business leaders are approaching the 2024 election and whether or not we should anticipate corporate America trying to sit this one out.', 'Well, I think you have to define their level of involvement here.', ""So what the Wall Street Journal was talking about is activities in the workplace itself where you're going to be uh tolerating discussions of political issues, especially some of these hot button ones."", ""Then there are campaign donations and I have a feeling that we're going to see a robust level of uh campaign donations from the corporate sector this year, which we always do honestly."", 'Um They do, they give to these campaigns for a couple of different reasons.', 'One is obviously uh whether you like or dislike the candidate.', 'There are big differences between the policies of the candidates this year, between Trump and Biden.', ""Uh Trump, of course, less regulation drill, baby drill, more fossil fuels, Biden, more emphasis on clean energy and other things we've been talking about."", ""Uh and we'll continue to talk about."", ""So there's that, but um corporations also just want to kind of play both sides in elections."", 'Uh We see this in donations to Congress often they will give to more or less equality equally to both parties because they want to make sure they have friends in high places no matter who wins.', ""So I think we're going to see the the donations uh keeping up."", ""Um But of course, in terms of some of these very hot button political issues, I mean, these are, can't win issues."", 'Do you favor the Israelis or the Palestinians?', 'Uh LGBT Q, we saw Bud Light get hammered on that last year.', ""Um It's like you just can't win by taking a stand, so they just want to be as neutral as possible."", ""Well, I'm curious then, Rick, you mentioned the policy differences, one of the differences between Trump and Biden, of course, with taxes, we have Trump tax cuts potentially expiring at the end of 2025."", 'What can you tell us about corporate borrowing so far this year and just how corporations are preparing for that expiration date?', ""Well, market watch had a story recently saying that corporate borrowing is up uh simply because, um, companies expect more volatility getting into the, uh the home stretch of the election later this year and then who knows what's going to happen after November, but important to point out here."", 'Um First of all, interest rates are high.', ""This is not a, this is not a great time to borrow and most analysts, including people we have on, I think literally every day think we're probably close to the peak for interest rates."", ""So there it would make sense to hold off if you can on borrowing and see if rates don't come down."", 'Um And the other thing is that the corporate the taxes that expire at the end of 2025 are individual tax cuts that went into effect in 2018.', 'The corporate tax cuts that were part of that deal uh are permanent.', 'Um Now, the concern is that as part of a negotiation, if Biden wins a second term, as part of negotiations, Biden might try to negotiate a higher corporate tax rate.', ""Um So you have to anticipate that, but listen, that it's very hard to play a uh an election one way or the other."", ""And I think you, you're going to see a lot of companies just basically waiting, trying to do

according to Reuters and uh there was previously talk of this uh reported by Bloomberg is that the uh chatbot essentially is a way of kind of, you know, trawling the internet uh for information to pull up uh data for you and, and, and give you uh uh you know, generated content, right?', ""So, because you can do that naturally, it's a, it's a good fit for uh search engines and look, Google is doing this already with their search generative experience."", ""Um I'm signed up for the, the betas for that uh uh or the early access and I do a regular Google search and uh in my, my app, I get generative uh text at the top uh and then links uh at the uh just below that and then the regular uh links uh that you would get when you did a normal search uh below those as well."", ""So, uh it's something that's around bing has been doing this, but for open A I to do it, I think is, is a much bigger deal just because of how popular chat GP T is."", 'And because of how uh much name recognition there is now uh behind O Open A I and Chat GP T and so, you know, is this going to be something that would replace Google?', ""That's a pretty big long shot."", 'Um You know, Microsoft is, you know, the, the biggest company in the world right now, um in terms of market cap and they are barely making a dent at all when it comes to market share uh from Google, uh you literally say I Google something.', ""Um You don't say I bing something and you probably aren't gonna say I, you know, chat GP T or whatever, they're gonna call it uh something."", ""Um And so, you know, I, I do think that it is interesting though, the way that they're supposed to announce it uh on Monday just a day before Google's IO conference where they're probably gonna have a lot more news on their search experience."", 'So I think overall this is something that, you know, is like I said, was predictable or is predictable.', 'Uh It makes a lot of sense for them.', ""Um But it's, it's gonna take a lot of work to try to the throne Google Dan."", 'How reliable is the information?', ""Because uh I, I think a lot of people who even use chat GP T whether it's casualty or even daily, there are still a lot of questions about the reliability of that information."", 'So how big of a factor is that going to be when we talk about the potential here for future growth?', 'Maybe?', ""Look, uh you know, hallucinations as, as they're called, which is just, you know, wrong information, um which is probably a more accurate way to describe it properly."", ""Uh They still haven't."", 'Right.', ""So it's not as though this isn't uh uh uh at issue still."", 'Uh There are ways that, that companies are, are mitigating it in, in some of their models.', 'Uh Part of that is to shrink down the size of the model.', ""So there's less of a, uh you know, there's not as much information."", ""So there's a smaller chance of, of an error."", ""Um It's more focused."", ""Um And so that's some of the ways, uh there's also something called R A uh that companies are using to help cut down uh on hallucinations."", ""But, you know, I, I think when it comes to, to something like, like a search engine, you know, you want to make sure that you're getting everything as accurate as possible."", ""And so it'll be interesting to see if they, if they've done something uh in some way to, to, you know, either fully cut down or, or nearly eliminate uh you know, these hallucinations, uh maybe work with Microsoft and, and Bing uh has helped them or maybe they're just doing it on their own and they figured out how to do it."", ""Um But, you know, it, it will be interesting and obviously, if you're looking for something online, you know, if I'm looking up, uh I don't know, like how to cut my cat's nails."", ""I don't want it to say take your cat's feet off or something like that, you know, like some kind of weird wrong information."", ""So, uh theyre they're going to have to ensure that there's a lot of

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.9%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.82 billion, up 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?', ""For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.63%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $1.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.82, delivering a surprise of +11.66%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of the global luxury and leisure travel industries in 2024, go directly and see 10 Most Glamorous Cities in the World.', ""As tourism demand continues to reclaim its pre-pandemic position in many of the most glamorous cities in the world, leisure travel has made a much faster recovery than business traffic. The clear divergence between the two categories has a substantial influence on the nature of monthly passenger demand. This is primarily owing to the fact that leisure travel is much more closely dependent on seasonal fluctuation in many of the most beautiful cities in the world- with peaks and dips corresponding in perfect lockstep with the Northern Hemisphere's summer and winter cycles, respectively. As a result, major players in the luxury travel industry like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ("", 'NYSE:HLT),', 'Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR), and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', 'NYSE:H)\xa0have had to manage the challenges posed by seasonal profitability oscillations, as well as additional pressure on operationality and staff during demand peaks. Despite these fluctuations, the luxury segment is projected to grow at 6% per year through to 2025 - much rapidly than any other chain-scale hotel segment. According to a report by Bloomberg, a network of more than 20,000 luxury travel enthusiasts are paying more than $1700 per night on average. This figure is up 69% when compared to the demand peak in 2019, when consumers were spending a mere $979 per night.', ""According to a press release by Embark Beyond, which caters to the travel requirements of high net-worth individuals from some of the most beautiful cities in the world, hotel prices have continued to skyrocket in a post-pandemic environment owing to pent up demand. According to the travel consultancy's founder Jack Ezon, the company's consumer base paid an average of more than $3682 per night for accommodations, up 56% when compared to 2021. These travelers have spent more than $32,000 per trip. In 2024, this trend has so far persisted. It is pertinent to note that luxury travelers are no overpaying by any standard; rather, the travel consultancies they use are securing them the best available rates. The surge in luxury consumer spending in some of the most glamorous cities in the world is owing to an unprecedented rise in hotel prices across sectors. Major companies like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ("", 'NYSE:HLT), Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', 'NYSE:H) are subject to inflationary pressures, with costs of restaurant meals, flights, home rentals, and gas skyrocketing in recent years.', 'ETF performance can provide an accurate gauge on favorability of the luxury travel industry. Take for instance AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (NYSE:BEDZ), which is one of the only actively managed funds tracking the investment performance of equities exclusively in the global hotel and travel-related industries. With $3.36 million in assets under management as of May 8, the ETF tracks major luxury holdings like Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and Booking Holdings Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:BKNG). In the last one year, the ETF is up 13.68% as of May 8, signaling a favorable outlook for the luxury travel segment in fiscal 2023-24. Another ETF to consider is Defiance Hotel Airline and Cruise ETF (NYSE:CRUZ), which aims to mirror performance before fees and expenses of the BlueStar Global Hotels, Airlines, and Cruises Index, a rules-based weighted index of companies primarily engaged in the luxury hospitality industry like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (', 'NYSE:HLT) and', 'InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (', 'NYSE:IHG). In the last one year, the ETF is up by 17.43% as of May 8.', 'However, according to projections, prices across most categories have already peaked and are now declining, even in some of the most beautiful cities in the world. For instance, in the summer of 2023, gas recorded highs of $5 per gallon before averaging $3.82 a gallon in 2024. Airline companies like American Airlines Group Inc. (', ""NASDAQ:AAL) have noticed a dip in demand, according to the company's Q4 2023 earnings call transcript. Additionally, with a rampant rise in luxury hotels and cutthroat competition with alternative options like Airbnb Inc. ("", 'NASDAQ:ABNB) in many of the most glamorous cities in the world, competition for customers is exacerbating for major names in the luxury segment.', ""Moreover, non-luxury players have also closed the gap on some of the physical attributes that are characteristic of luxury like glamorous mattress tops and rainfall showerheads, etc. A major trend influencing the luxury segment is that the meaning of what constitutes 'luxury' is undergoing a massive shift across the larger service industry. Tourists are placing higher value on unique experiences and vibrant environments in the most glamorous cities in the world relative to tangible product portfolios and opulent formalities. Overall, tourists are gravitating towards recreational experiences while interest in nonessential products and services is declining according to consumer spending data."", 'Therefore, apprehensions about the luxury services industry plateauing are rising as consumers are giving companies like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (', 'NYSE:HLT), Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', ""NYSE:H) a strong pushback and postponing their travel plans to the most beautiful cities in the world to more affordable seasons. Greece is a prime example. It was one of the first countries to reopen post the COVID-19 pandemic and hence, was one of the first to reach a post-COVID 'normal'. However, the boom days seem to be dissipating as hotel rates have fallen more than 12% year-to-date in many of the most beautiful cities in the world. According to Ezon, this shift is not owing to any particular ceiling on what tourists are willing to spend. The consumer's calculations and preferences are undergoing a shift not because their budgets are particularly constrained but owing to better weather and rates in the autumn season. Furthermore, in a post-pandemic environment, more options are available to the average consumer, with cheaper markets offering better services, and since hotel prices are a simple measure of supply and demand, travel to some of the most glamorous cities in the world is taking a backseat. You can read more on the luxury hospitality segment in our article\xa030 Most Luxurious Hotels in the World."", 'In order to offset many of the headwinds perpetrated by inflationary pressures and changing consumer sentiment regarding travel to the most beautiful cities in the world, major luxury travel stocks like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (', 'NYSE:HLT), Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', ""NYSE:H) are divesting greater investments in getting rid of all singular pain points in the hotels' operationality. For instance, hotels are using AI technology and integrating more flexible options to do away with check-in queues. According to Forbes, one of the most enduring tourist trends which have persisted long after the pandemic is the shift in demand towards self-service. Online reservations and contactless check-ins/out were lifelines for the larger industry in 2020, and such demand has persisted."", ""Furthermore, major luxury hospitality players are also realizing that the average consumer is more informed and the demand for properties which are respectful of the environment is on the rise, with Booking.com's Sustainable Travel Report 2022 claiming that more than 81% of global travelers have maintained that sustainability is a primary determinant when picking a location from the most glamorous cities in the world. Half of this percentage cited climate change as their primary source of influence for making better choices for the environment. The global demand for sustainability comprises property construction methods and food processing, among others, with sustainability acting as one of the most prominent segmentation factors for winners and losers. According to a report by Forbes, hospitality corporations are realizing the importance of implementing more environmentally-conscious processes into their operations. In a bid to capitalize upon this substantial chunk of the luxury travel market, hotel companies like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ("", 'NYSE:HLT), Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', 'NYSE:H) are swapping out obsolete strategies with more positively impactful initiatives in many of the most beautiful cities in the world. One major way they are doing this is by shifting to greener products and energy-efficient appliances. Moreover, corporations are also investing in water conservation, sustainable packaging, and renewable energy sources. For instance, in 2023, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (', 'NYSE:HLT) has pledged to reduce its waste by more than 50% by 2030, becoming one of the first major hotel companies to integrate science-based carbon targets in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement into their day-to-day operations.', 'Lastly, according to a report by McKinsey, the COVID-19 pandemic forced hotel staff to stay at home, with more than 70% of staff laid off in the United States in 2022. During this time, hospitality workers reevaluated their career paths and work-life balance and shifted to employment opportunities which offer greater flexibility or higher renumeration, like retail or warehousing. A survey conducted by McKinsey discovered that 87% of luxury hotels in the many of the most beautiful cities in the United States do not have enough staff, with more than 36% citing severe staff shortages. To offset these headwinds, major luxury players like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (', 'NYSE:HLT), Marriott International Inc. (', 'NASDAQ:MAR) and', 'Hyatt Hotels Corporation (', 'NYSE:H) are turning to standardized, activity-based metrics to predict frontline coverage requirements. They are also offering distinct roles with clear divisions between managers and frontline employees, with each vertical offering different promotion pathways. Lastly, where management extends across multiple locations across many of the most glamorous cities in the world, companies are staffing roles to cover a network of properties rather than individual hotels.', ""A woman traveling in a luxury station wagon, showcasing the company's exclusive luggage and travel items."", 'To compile our list of the 50 most glamorous cities in the world, we decided to use the index from our article Top\xa050 Richest Cities In The World to compile a primary list of the top 100 cities in the world with high GDP per capita and significant financial sectors. We operated under the hypothesis that favorable economic indicators tend to attract luxury brands, upscale restaurants, and high-end entertainment, indicators most commonly associated with poshness and glamour.', ""Since glamour is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we decided to consult a study by the Erasmus University of Rotterdam in the Netherlands which uses focus groups to determine how residents and tourists perceive city brands, using Rotterdam's 'Make-it-happen' brand as a sample. The study concluded that most residents and tourists tended to reject the city brand of Rotterdam as 'glamourized' whilst highlighting certain metrics tourists used to perceive glamour. We used the perceptions of residents and tourists with respect to the city of Rotterdam and extrapolated its findings across our primary list of 100 cities to establish a three-pronged criteria to measure the glamour of each city; the criteria is premised on the quality of each city's fashion industry using the index from our article 15 Best Cities for Modeling in the World (35 points), entertainment and culture using the index from our article 30 Most Interesting Cities in America (30 points), and nightlife using the index from our article 25 Cities With the Best Nightlife in the World (25 points). We then proceeded to award each city a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 50 cities which scored the highest points.

As noted in our press release, our third quarter earnings results outperformed expectations, reflecting an unwavering commitment to disciplined brand building and operational excellence. Our talented global teams continued to advance our long-term initiatives, fueling innovation and consumer connections, while successfully harnessing the power of our customer engagement platform to navigate the dynamic backdrop with focus and agility. Touching on the highlights for the quarter. First, we delivered total revenue in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis, consistent with the low end of our guidance range. These top line results were led by international growth of 3% at constant currency, which included increases of 19% in Europe, 15% in Other Asia, and 2% in Japan, with each region expanding versus the prior year fueled by traction with tourists.', ""In Greater China, as anticipated, sales declined 2% against last year's strong revenge spending. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China, despite a more gradual recovery in the region than originally expected, and we continue to invest in our brands, teams, and platforms to support our growth. Finally, in North America, revenue declined 3% compared to last year, amid a challenging consumer backdrop. Importantly, we are continuing to drive a healthy business, underscored by significant gross margin expansion compared to last year and our plan. Second, we continue to put the consumer at the center of everything we do to drive engagement and emotional connections with our brands. In the quarter, we acquired approximately 1.2 million new customers in North America alone, of which over half were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands."", ""And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America. Third, we delivered unique omni-channel experiences with a focus on driving brand desire, consumer connections and cultural relevance. We launched immersive retail experiences across brands globally with highlights that include the continued rollout of the Coach play concept and Kate Spade's successful renovation of the Gotemba outlet in Japan. And just last month, we introduced the Stuart Weitzman shop-in-shop in Nordstrom in New York City. We believe these locations drive awareness and customer acquisition, notably with younger cohorts. Further, we maintained our strong digital positioning with sales more than three times above pre-pandemic levels, which represented over 25% of revenue."", ""Importantly, our digital business is underpinned by Tapestry's data-rich platform and leading capabilities, which has enabled us to seamlessly meet consumers where and how they're shopping across their purchase journey. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence by delivering compelling assortments to consumers with particular success at Coach, where we drove handbag AUR gains at constant currency. Importantly, this focus also continued to drive operational gross margin expansion, helping to fuel our highest third quarter gross margin in nearly two decades. We understand innovation wins with consumers, and we are committed to bringing creativity, quality and compelling value to customers around the world. Overall, we generated third quarter operating income and earnings above expectations, driven by stronger-than-anticipated margins, highlighting the power of brand building, consumer centricity and operational agility."", ""We achieved these results while making strategic investments in our brands to support healthy, sustainable growth into the future. Now turning to highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Our team delivered another strong quarter with the power of the brand's unique expressive luxury positioning once again on display. We continue to infuse innovation across all customer touch points driving engagement, cultural relevance and emotional connections with customers globally. Importantly, the success of our strategies, together with consistent execution is evident in our financial results, with revenue growth at constant currency, significant gross margin expansion and profit gains with further runway ahead. Now touching on some details of the third quarter."", ""We continue to drive growth in our handbag offering, led by our iconic platforms. The Tabby family delivered another quarter ahead of expectations and nearly doubled versus last year. The introduction of our Quilted Tabby was an incredible success fueled by the top-selling Black Tabby with brass hardware at a premium AUR of $550. At the same time, Core Tabby styles remain strong, and we see further opportunity ahead across the entire family. While we continue to animate this family, we're leaning into key styles including Quilted Tabby and see further opportunity ahead. Across the balance of the assortment, our Timeless Willow and Rogue families remain foundational volume drivers. And we augmented our offering to build relevance with younger consumers, including the Coach original Swing Zip, which has gone viral on social media as well as the ACE Tote, both of which over-indexed with Gen Z customers."", ""Overall, our creative and innovative products supported an increase in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including growth in North America. Looking forward, we see continued runway longer-term, given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. At the same time, we advanced our focus on building out the lifestyle assortment to expand the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value. In footwear, sales rose against last year, reflecting success in our core styles, notably the low line sneaker as well as strength in newness, including our BRENT sandal. In men's, the Gotham, Charter and recently launched Coach Family led in the quarter. And in ready-to-wear, we debut classic denim styles contributing to the strong success of denim across all categories in keeping with market trends."", ""Next, we created purpose-led storytelling, building meaningful emotional connections with brand. We again blended purpose and product with our spring 'Find Your Courage' campaign, inspiring consumers to embrace confident self-expression. The campaign takes place between the physical and virtual worlds, brought to life with the help of members of the Coach Family, including Lil Nas X, Camila Mendes, Youngji Lee, Kōki, and Wu Jinyan as well as our newest member, imam, a virtual model and digital creator. Further, we launched deeply unique and immersive retail experiences across the globe, engaging the consumer across all five senses. We took Coach Play to Tokyo, opening our largest concept store yet on Cat Street, which celebrates the brand's heritage, self-expression and local Japanese culture."", ""Importantly, the store resonates with younger consumers and has outperformed expectations. In March, we launched the brand's first full-service restaurant at the Grand Indonesia Mall in Jakarta, highlighting Coach's expanding presence in Southeast Asia and our strategy to connect with consumers through experiences beyond product. Overall, the brand's marketing and focus on omnichannel experiences helped to drive new customer acquisition, including nearly 800,000 new customers in North America, of which nearly 60% were Gen Z and Millennials. And we've seen gains in brand awareness in the US per our brand tracking work, underscoring that our investments in brand building are working. Finally, we continue to build our sub-brand, Coachtopia, our reimagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity, which has driven incremental brand relevancy and desire."", ""During the quarter, we launched the road to circularity, a Coachtopia docu series that explores how we're reimagining waste as a valuable raw material. And in April, we unveiled Coachtopia's inaugural store in Hainan, an initiative that combines our mission of sustainability and our commitment with investing in brand building in China and with Chinese consumers. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we're excited by the momentum we're building specifically with younger audiences. In closing, Coach is fueling consumer desire, bringing expressive luxury to life while driving sustainable, healthy profit growth that funds investments in brand building. We are confident in the future and the tremendous potential for this iconic brand."", ""Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, while top line results were challenged as anticipated, profit exceeded expectations in prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. Importantly, we advanced our strategic agenda, sharpening our execution to bring enhanced innovation to consumers. And where we've offered newness, we've seen our customer respond. This progress reinforces our path forward as we build a more profitable business, while remaining focused on driving the top line growth required to realize the long-term potential of the brand. Now touching on our strategic priorities and results in more detail. First, we remain focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag foundation, a requirement to win in today's dynamic consumer backdrop."", ""During the quarter, we broadened the core assortment across channels through new introductions, including the Suite Work Tote, Seabee and Spade Flower Signature programs. Importantly, newness drove higher customer recruitment, AUR and gross margin versus the balance of the offering. At the same time, the performance of newness also reinforces our sense of urgency to refresh our carryover families, which remain pressured. To this end, the pipeline of handbag newness will continue to increase into fiscal year 2025, building on the progress we're seeing today and supporting the brand's runway for enhanced revenue and profitability. And as we innovate our core handbag offering, we will also continue to deliver emotional lifestyle assortments, a differentiator for the brand."", ""During the quarter, we delivered growth in jewelry, which is a key recruitment vehicle and profit driver for the brand. Now, turning to our second strategic focus area, powering the omnichannel experience to drive customer engagement. As you know, we recently launched a dedicated katespadeoutlet.com site, replacing the brand's surprise site and providing a more seamless way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. As a result of this effort, our outlet omnichannel customer penetration increased in the quarter and remains an opportunity to drive customer lifetime value over time. Further, by bringing a more unified experience to consumers across all brand touch points, we can continue to more efficiently scale our marketing and merchandising efforts, supporting our goal of driving sustainable direct-to-consumer growth."", ""Third, we are focused on creating emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat. During the quarter, we launched a new global campaign Time to Spring, anchored in the brand codes of joy, color in New York City, which garnered significant media impressions and strong engagement on social platforms. Our marketing investments supported the acquisition of approximately 400,000 new customers to the brand in North America. Moving forward, we will continue to distort our marketing efforts to top and mid-funnel activations that support brand building and growth. And finally, we will maintain a commitment to operational excellence, positioning the brand for long-term success, this focus has underpinned the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion this year and is embedded in our strategies and ways of working for the future."", ""Overall, we continue to advance our long-term strategies with a relentless focus on accelerating our progress. Our path forward is clear, and our vision for the brand and its potential is unchanged. Turning to Stuart Weitzman. Results in the quarter were pressured, reflecting headwinds in the brand's two key markets of North America and Greater China. Despite the challenged financial performance, we remain focused on supporting brand health by investing in product and marketing to drive growth and profitability long-term. Touching briefly on these focus areas. During the quarter, we expanded our assortment of casual styles in keeping with market trends. This included new block heels, wedges, bale flats and loafers, which are performing particularly well across key full-price wholesale accounts, supporting strong sales gains at POS in North America."", ""Further, our fall and pre-spring wholesale bookings are up meaningfully, reflecting our progress in delivering product innovation and relevancy. Further, we continued to build out new categories with the launch of the brand's men's collection and an expanded sneaker assortment. At the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove growth at high AUR. Now, turning to marketing. During the quarter, we drove relevance by tapping into cultural moments to amplify our key product strategies, for example, we launched our pre-spring collection with the backdrop of Palm Beach and leveraged a multifaceted influencer approach to reinforce our recently launched sneaker offering with Sofia Richie Grainge, Suki Waterhouse, and Jenna Dewan showcasing Stuart Weitzman Trainers."", ""As a result of these efforts, U.S. Google search queries for the brand increased, while consideration also rose in the U.S. per YouGov. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team is leaning in to accelerate progress and enhance profitability longer term through relevant, differentiated product and emotional marketing to fuel brand desire. In closing, Tapestry delivered third quarter earnings ahead of expectations, successfully advancing our strategic agenda to power our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing environment, while investing in our future. We remain confident in our vision and the significant long-term opportunity to drive sustainable organic top and bottom-line gains and meaningful shareholder value. Before turning the call over to Scott to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail, I'd like to provide an update on our pending acquisition of Capri."", ""First and foremost, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation. The combined company will bring significant benefits to customers, employees, partners, and shareholders around the world. By investing in and growing Capri's brands, we will bring more innovation to more consumers globally, positioning us to better compete within the growing over $200 billion global luxury market for handbags, accessories, footwear, and apparel. Further, through this combination, we will be a home and incubator for talent, driving our purpose-led and people-centered mission and continuing to elevate employee and consumer experiences. With regard to the transaction timeline, following unconditional approval from the European Commission and regulatory approvals in China and Japan, the FTC filed a suit on April 22nd to block the proposed acquisition."", ""We remain confident in the merits and pro-competitive pro-consumer nature of this transaction and look forward to presenting our strong legal arguments in court. Our timeline always contemplated the potential for litigation and we continue to expeditiously work to close the transaction in calendar year 2024. In the meantime, and as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our current business and strategic growth agenda. I'll now turn it over to Scott."", 'Scott Roe: Thanks Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, our fiscal Q3 operating income and EPS exceeded expectations, demonstrating our disciplined execution and agility. Importantly, we significantly expanded gross margin and generated strong free cash flow, while investing in future growth drivers for our brands and business. Now, moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and at the low end of our guided range. These results were led by 3% growth internationally, driven by gains in Japan, Other Asia, and Europe, even as we anniversaried growth from the prior year. In Japan, sales grew 2%, and in Other Asia, revenue rose 15% with growth in each country in the region, notably Korea and Malaysia.', ""In Europe, growth continued with revenue 19% above last year. And in Greater China, as expected, revenue declined 2% as we lapped last year's resurgence in traffic and spend following the end of COVID-related restrictions in the region. In North America, sales declined 3% compared to the prior year amid a challenging consumer backdrop, though gross margin rose significantly and outperformed plan as we supported brand health. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business declined 4% due to declines in North America and Greater China. And in Wholesale, revenue grew over 20%, led by strength in international, supported by our strategic growth initiatives on digital platforms. Moving down the P&L. We delivered the strongest third quarter gross margin in nearly two decades, which was ahead of our expectations and 190 basis points above last year."", 'This year-over-year expansion was driven by the benefit of 100 basis points from lower freight expense, FX tailwinds as well as operational outperformance. SG&A was relatively flat with last year and favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and rate basis, reflecting operational savings as we continue to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. In addition, SG&A benefited from an expense timing shift of approximately $20 million into the fourth quarter, primarily relating to marketing. So taken together, operating margin expanded 110 basis points, and operating income rose 6% compared to the prior year, well ahead of plan and third quarter EPS of $0.81 beat our expectations by approximately $0.15 fueled by an operational beat as well as the previously mentioned favorable expense timing shift worth roughly $0.06.', 'Now, turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.7 billion which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $79 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $29 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 12% below the prior year, underscoring our focus on disciplined inventory management and driving inventory turn. Looking forward, our inventory is well controlled and current, and we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea disruption with only modest impact, which has been incorporated into our outlook. Importantly, we expect to end Q4 with inventory in line with the prior year, well positioned into fiscal year 2025.', ""Turning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $80 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year. Now, moving to our guidance for fiscal year 2024, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. We are maintaining our fiscal year 2024 EPS outlook supported by the third quarter's outperformance while taking a prudent approach to the fourth quarter planning. For the year, we're modifying our top line outlook to incorporate more moderate trends in both North America and Greater China across brands."", 'That said, our EPS outlook is unchanged, supported by stronger margin results and a commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands. Moving to the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of over $6.6 billion, approximately in line with the prior year on a reported basis and representing growth of about 1% on a constant currency basis. Moving to sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we expect revenue to decline slightly versus last year. In Greater China, we anticipate low single-digit sales growth. In Japan, revenue is forecasted to grow mid single digits, while Other Asia is expected to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate low double-digit growth. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of 110 basis points.', 'We anticipate gross margin to expand approximately 230 basis points, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs of roughly 130 basis points. On SG&A expenses, we expect deleverage of roughly 120 basis points, reflecting reinvestments in our brands, people and business in supportive growth initiatives. Moving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $12 million, which incorporates higher yield on cash and investments compared to the previous outlook. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 233 million shares. So taken together, we continue to expect EPS of $4.20 to $4.25, representing 8% to 9% growth versus last year.', 'Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $140 million. This forecast includes nearly half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia, with the balance primarily related to ongoing digital and IT investments. Quickly touching on our outlook for the fourth quarter specifically. Our guidance implies an expected sales decline in the area of 1% at constant currency, or roughly 3% below the prior year on a reported basis including an FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points. Further, we anticipate an operating margin decline in the area of 50 basis points, which incorporates the expectation for continued strong gross margin gains, offset by higher SG&A in part due to the negative impact of the expense timing shift from the third quarter.', ""Taken together, EPS for the fourth quarter is forecasted to be in the area of $0.85. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5 times on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within two years of the Capri transaction close. Finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return."", ""Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. Before closing, I'd like to touch on the acquisition of Capri and reiterate our confidence in the excellent strategic fit and value creation opportunity it presents. We believe the transaction will enhance our strong organic growth and TSR potential, supported by double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis, enhanced cash flow more than $200 million of cost synergies and compelling ROIC, accelerating benefits for our consumers, employees, partners and shareholders for years to come. In closing, for the quarter, we built on our track record of operational excellence, driving margin and EPS outperformance against a challenging demand backdrop, advancing our long-term growth initiatives and controlling the controllables."", ""In addition, we generated strong free cash flow while continuing to invest for the future. Our consistent earnings delivery demonstrates the power of our operating model and talented global teams. Looking forward, we remain confident in our vision and in our ability to realize it with a steadfast commitment to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns.

The billionaire investor has a reputation for sticking with companies whose earnings and cash flow trends are predictable well into the future. That's much easier to do with a company like Coca-Cola than it is for one like Nvidia."", 'Yet Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway has held onto a big investment into another tech stock that, like Nvidia, is a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" Let\'s look at some reasons why Berkshire Hathaway might be holding onto Amazon\xa0(NASDAQ: AMZN) as an excellent long-term growth investment.', ""The e-commerce titan's late-April earnings report was packed with good news for investors, including positive revenue trends. Amazon added $16 billion to its sales footprint in the quarter, translating into a 13% increase year over year. Cash trends were just as impressive, though, and point to potentially massive earnings growth ahead."", 'Amazon has been cutting costs even as its sales are tilting more toward cloud services versus low-margin product sales. You can see evidence of the dramatic financial impact here in the fact that operating cash flow has nearly doubled to $99 billion over the past year.', 'Management focuses on long-term growth in this key financial metric, and it\'s clear that gains here are helping push earnings higher as well. Amazon\'s net income soared to $10 billion from just $3 billion in Q1. ""It was a good start to the year across the business,"" CEO Andy Jassy said, in a press release.', ""You'd be wrong to think that this business is too big to grow. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is booming as companies speed up their migrations to the cloud. There's even more excitement for expansion in the platform now that artificial intelligence (AI) is boosting its value."", ""All told, that segment accelerated to a blazing 17% growth rate last quarter, beating the pace of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. AWS is now running at a $100 billion annual sales rate."", ""Amazon's e-commerce business has also returned to fast growth following its post-pandemic hangover. Gains here reflect the company's unmatchable scale and its huge market share in this attractive industry. Many smaller rivals, including eBay, have described challenges in keeping sales moving higher. It's great news for Amazon investors, then, that the company is still winning market share and adding to its huge industry lead."", ""As Buffett likes to point out, owning a wonderful business won't do much for your portfolio if you pay too high of a price for it. That's an elevated risk for most stocks today given the market's rally over the past year. Amazon has outpaced that rally, too, soaring 80% in the last 12 months compared to a 24% increase in the S&P 500."", ""That's no reason to ignore this stellar business, though. Amazon's shares are priced at 3.3 times sales, making it by far the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven on this metric. Microsoft is valued at 13 times sales, for context."", ""Amazon isn't nearly as profitable as the software giant, of course. Compare its 8% operating profit margin with Microsoft's blazing 45% rate."", ""It will be a long time before Amazon's margins reach anything approaching that level. But profitability is moving in that direction as sales tilt toward the services segment. Patiently holding the stock for the next few years will allow shareholders to benefit from that positive long-term trend."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

However, that figure was more than 300% at one time; the stock is nowhere near its 2024 highs."", 'With the stock about $400 off of its highs, is it time to buy the dip? After all, Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) has been growing at a lightning pace.', ""Supermicro is cashing in on the same trend that many others have been: artificial intelligence (AI). In essence, Super Micro Computer gave investors a second chance to buy Nvidia, as it's a very similar style of investment."", ""Super Micro Computer makes highly customizable servers, which are essential for maximizing the performance of the hardware within them. For AI, these servers are packed full of GPUs (graphics processing units), often made by AI king Nvidia. Companies wanting to expand their computing power can't just haphazardly hook up their GPUs; they need to put them in a server where they are properly networked and cooled. As the demand for AI computing power accelerates, Supermicro benefits."", 'Supermicro is also closely tied with Nvidia, which was on display when Super Micro Computer became the first server maker to market Nvidia GH200 and GB200 GPUs, which are next-generation technologies.', 'The demand increase that Supermicro is experiencing is very similar to the level Nvidia saw back in 2023. So, when investors recognized this at the start of 2024, they bid up the stock to levels where Supermicro would have been if it had experienced the same growth as Nvidia.', 'However, the market realized that this level was far too high, which is why the stock sold off recently. Its earnings, though, have been nothing short of fantastic.', ""In the fiscal third-quarter of 2024 that ended March 31, Supermicro's revenue rose an astounding 200% year over year to $3.85 billion. Guidance was also strong, with management expecting between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion in revenue for fiscal Q4, representing 133% to 152% growth."", ""But the problem is that the market was expecting that level of growth, so the stock didn't skyrocket following earnings; it actually fell more than 10%."", ""The biggest issue with Super Micro Computer is that its current trading level doesn't align with management's long-term goals, which are to achieve $25 billion in annual revenue. In the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted a profit margin of 10%, so if it could maintain that profitability level for an entire year and hit its revenue goal, it would produce $2.5 billion in profits. Supermicro currently sports a $48 billion market cap, so the stock would trade around 19 times earnings if all those projections were true."", ""Considering that Nvidia trades for around 34 times forward earnings right now, this doesn't leave much room for Supermicro's stock to grow. Furthermore, Supermicro should be valued at a discount to Nvidia as it doesn't have as much differentiating technology or margin levels as Nvidia does."", ""As a result, Super Micro Computer is still trading around levels that it would be if it hit management's long-term goals. That doesn't leave much room for upside, which makes me want to avoid the stock."", ""One thing to note: This doesn't mean I think Supermicro will struggle as a company. Due to massive AI demand, it should do quite well. However, the juice has already been squeezed from this stock, and AI investors should look for another company to quench their AI thirst."", 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

That's for good reason; according to research by Statista, the AI market will hit $184 billion this year and grow to more than $800 billion by 2030."", 'In other words, there is still time to position your portfolio to enjoy these powerful growth tailwinds.', 'Life-changing investment returns are a high bar and a term probably thrown around too easily. However, if you pick the right stocks, a large and growing industry can turn modest investments into millions.', 'Here are three potential millionaire-making candidates that long-term investors should check out for their long-term portfolio.', ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) probably isn't some secret by this point. The multitrillion-dollar giant has been an early winner as AI companies fight over its GPU chips to power their AI models. Some estimates peg Nvidia's market share for AI chips as high as 90%, nearly a monopoly on what could be a $400 billion market, according to rivals. Nvidia has long specialized in chips for demanding computing applications, but its proprietary CUDA software has been integral in helping users easily unlock the chips' full computing power for AI applications."", ""Importantly, Nvidia probably doesn't have enough room to grow market-cap-wise to make you a millionaire. It's already one of the world's largest companies. However, years of steady AI chip demand could make Nvidia flush with enough cash to drive outstanding investment returns by returning profits to shareholders as dividends (yes, Nvidia pays one) and share repurchases. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, maintains confidence in the company's competitive position. He quipped that Nvidia's product is so good that competitors could give it away for free, but it still wouldn't be enough value to displace Nvidia."", ""Time will tell how true that is, as a $400 billion market will attract endless competitive efforts to dethrone Nvidia. However, one could argue that Nvidia only becomes harder to knock off the mountain the more widespread its chips become and the deeper Nvidia's pockets grow."", ""Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is increasingly becoming a household name among investors. Its secrecy in working with the U.S. government and its allies had long shrouded the company in mystery. However, Palantir has aggressively (and successfully) branched to commercial markets. Palantir helps create and deploy custom software on its three platforms: AIP, Gotham, and Foundry. Its software could be considered an organization's operating system, analyzing data to help aid decision-making in real-time."", ""A little imagination could illustrate the types of use cases Palantir could have within the government, where it's a close partner throughout the Department of Defense. The company is also loaded to the gills with $3.6 billion in cash, carrying zero debt. The business is generating cash flow and is also generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitable. Analysts believe Palantir's earnings could grow at an annualized average of 26% over the long term, meaning profits would double every three years."", 'That pace of growth is enough to compound over a 10- to 20-year time horizon, making Palantir a great buy-and-hold candidate. The company still has just 554 customers, leaving much room for customer expansion over the coming years.', 'SentinelOne (NYSE: S) is probably not among the first three names mentioned if someone is asked to list three cybersecurity companies. However, underestimating its potential could cost you money. SentinelOne uses artificial intelligence to hunt for malicious network and device threats. While traditional antivirus software would look for known threats against a database, AI enables SentinelOne to identify and isolate never-before-seen threats based on how the AI charts out every file and action a computer makes. It can look for ""suspicious"" actors.', ""The company has received accolades for its product, routinely getting recognition from third-party technology firms like Gartner. Despite facing intense competition from legacy security companies and next-generation rivals like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne continues to grow quickly. The business could surpass $800 million in sales this year and is quickly improving its margins as it grows revenue faster than expenses. Don't worry; SentinelOne has enough cash to fund the business for years until it eventually profits."", ""The upside of SentinelOne is that it's a top-notch product, but it is a small company with a market cap of just $6.5 billion today. Long-term success could easily make SentinelOne stock a multibagger, so it's worth keeping an eye on the company as a potential long-term investment with more risk but more reward than your run-of-the-mill names."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

That represents potential gains for investors of 22% over the coming year, compared to the stock\'s closing price on Wednesday. The analyst posits that Nvidia\'s processors will ""remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future.""', ""The analyst has a point. Competitors have been trying to take the crown from Nvidia for years, yet its technology is unsurpassed for processing AI. Alphabet unveiled Google's first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) AI chip in 2015, and Amazon debuted its Inferentia AI chip in 2018."", 'Despite those years of competition, Nvidia remains unchallenged. Why? The company spent 20% of its fiscal 2024 revenue on research and development, and its technology is light years ahead of its rivals.', 'Hari\'s channel checks suggest ""continued robust AI server demand,"" which will fuel Nvidia\'s future profitability. As a result, he boosted the company\'s non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate for fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027 by 8%, on average. Furthermore, the analyst believes his peers have set their profit targets too low, which will drive ""another leg up"" for Nvidia stock.', ""It's good to see one of Wall Street's finest focus on the long term, as that's the real edge we have as investors.

It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$3.4b were what the analysts expected, Fox surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$1.40 per share, an impressive 46% above what was forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Fox ', ""Following the latest results, Fox's 21 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$15.1b in 2025. This would be a meaningful 8.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 8.0% to US$3.60. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.54 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$36.85, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Fox, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$62.00 and the most bearish at US$29.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Fox's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 6.9% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.7% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.3% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Fox to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Fox analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Fox (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you need to take into consideration."", 'Have feedback on this article?

If you don’t have brunch reservations, might I recommend dinner or a DIY brunch at home? Not only brunch but also flowers are synonymous with the day. Literally millions of flowers are moved across the country and internationally for Mother’s Day. Since the rush is for one major day, there is a lot of pressure for the logistics partners to step up and have the solutions to getting the fresh flowers from the fields to bouquets for the special day.', 'It’s kind of the same process as Valentine’s Day – the only holiday for which more flowers are shipped than Mother’s Day – but there is a wider variety of flowers versus just the traditional roses. Fun fact: There are nearly 56 million pounds of fresh flowers moved just for Mother’s Day. C.H. Robinson has one of the largest temperature-controlled capacity networks in North America and handles a significant share of the rush floral orders. Mike Moyski, vice president, temperature-controlled and flatbed, C.H. Robinson, said, “We are proud of our ability to quickly scale to meet our customers’ needs and reduce complexities that can lead to delays. With florals, the clock on freshness runs down quickly.”', 'The journey of a bouquet goes from the fields straight to a temperature-controlled facility in Latin America, commonly in Colombia or Ecuador, to be cooled to 34 degrees Fahrenheit. From there, the flowers hop on a plane to Miami International Airport for processing and inspection, then more cooling and consolidation before trekking across the country via refrigerated trailers to floral shops. From there, consumers pick what they want and mothers across the country are happy.', '\xa0', 'Ranpak Holdings Corp. has launched the Climaliner Plus, temperature-protective paper liners for cold chain shipping, and Naturemailer eco-friendly padded mailers. Both products are 100% curbside-recyclable. Climaliner Plus liners provide up to 72 hours of thermal protection while being secondary food contact-safe.\xa0 The Naturemailer is a honeycomb design that provides protection while still maintaining temperature and Ranpak’s commitment to sustainability.', 'As highlighted in a press release, “The naturemailer solution harnesses the inherent strength of paper itself, eliminating the need for foam or poly interiors. Additionally, its user-friendly design features a self-sealing adhesive and pull-tab tear strip that simplifies the packing and opening processes. These features enhance the consumer experience while boosting productivity and cost savings for businesses across industries, such as e-commerce, healthcare, electronics, and industrial manufacturing.”', 'Significant developments in gene therapies have provided quite the hurdle to supply chains. Currently more than 20 gene therapies are expected to be approved by the end of 2025, which means by the end of that year there will need to be facilities ranging from manufacturing to storage and distribution to handle the required ultracold temperatures.', 'These specific therapies are a little different from traditional pharmaceuticals that need to be kept cold. Some cost millions of dollars for a one-time treatment. For example, atidarsagene autotemcel can cost $4.25 million for a one-time treatment. This medicine is for children with early onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, an ultrarare, rapidly progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal neurometabolic disease.', 'The rise in approval of these types of treatments gives cold chain providers a short window to plan and prepare for such shipments as the margin for error is razor-thin. It’s not just a pallet of lettuce that could spoil; it’s people’s lives and millions of dollars at stake.', 'This week’s SONAR market is the home of Mother’s Day flowers, Miami. The entire month of April had reefer outbound tender volumes hitting highs for the year as millions upon millions of fresh flowers entered the country. As reefer outbound tender volumes dropped off, that’s when reefer rejection rates shot up. Reefer rejection rates of 2.18% are still reasonable as the national average is at 3.93%. Spot rates in Miami aren’t hitting new heights and will likely return to lower levels that match early April or even lower as the flower business has tapered off – that is, until produce season comes.

Since issuing Phase 1 of its GHG regulations in 2011, EPA emissions rules for all vehicle classes have become increasingly rigorous. The latest Phase 3 rule continues to address heavy-duty vehicles which the EPA separates into five categories: light heavy-duty vocational; medium heavy-duty vocational; heavy heavy-duty vocational; short-haul (day cab) tractors; and long-haul (sleeper cab) tractors.', 'In its introduction for GHG Phase 3, EPA pointed out that its latest phase sets new carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2032 ""with more stringent CO2 standards phasing in as early as MY 2027 for certain vehicle categories."" Prior to finalizing GHG standards, EPA considers comments from various stakeholders like manufacturers, fleets, owner-operators, trucking associations, environmental interest groups and private citizens. The standards are technology-neutral and performance-based, allowing each manufacturer to choose what set of emissions control technologies is best suited to meet the standards and the needs of their customers.', '""We have assessed and demonstrated that these standards are appropriate and feasible considering cost, lead time, and other relevant factors,"" EPA noted in its executive summary.', ""While there is plenty to read in all 392 pages of GHG Phase 3, let's look at five major takeaways:"", 'The initial rollout for Phase 3 GHG impacts only MY 2027 light heavy-duty and medium heavy-duty on-highway vocational vehicles such as commercial chassis cabs, panel vans and box trucks (complete pickups not included) ranging from Class 2b to 3, or 8,500 to 14,000 lb. gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Though EPA does not endorse any particular technology and does not mandate the use of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), they do project a possible path of compliance for MY 2027 light heavy-duty vocational with 17% ZEVs and 83% powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). MY 2027 medium heavy-duty vocational could be a mix of 13% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) and 87% ICE.', ""Lower Phase 3 standards come next for MY 2028 short-haul (day cab) tractors which the EPA anticipates will be a combination of 8% ZEV and 92% ICE. MY 2029 heavy heavy-duty vehicles follow with a projected mix of 13% ZEV and 87% ICE. MY 2030 long-haul (sleeper cab) bring up the rear with an anticipated adoption rate of 6% ZEV and 94% ICE. Check the EPA's table below for other projected rates of adoption for subsequent model years through 2032."", ""EPA set its GHG Phase 3 timeline based on current and projected advances to prevent and control GHG emissions. The EPA makes clear that it does not pick and choose when it comes to emissions reduction. The agency recognizes that fleets and owner-operators will continue to adopt emerging technologies. Options such as all-electric, fuel cell and internal combustion will continue to play a vital role. A range of technologies can meet the demanding heavy-duty power requirements while continuing to reduce emissions along the way. For example, the Biden administration recently acknowledged the importance of emissions reduction through support of research and development of hydrogen internal combustion engines, including Cummins' X15H. EPA states in GHG Phase 3 that hydrogen engines have essentially a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions."", 'The EPA also announced that it is adding warranty requirements for batteries and other components of zero-emission vehicles and requiring customer-facing battery state-of-health monitors for plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles.', 'EPA notes it has improved its analysis of infrastructure readiness for heavy-duty all-electric, hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion trucks. Citing growing public and private funding sources, the agency states, ""there are significant efforts already underway to develop and expand heavy-duty vehicle electric charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure.""', ""Through Cummins' multi-solutions approach, the company can offer customers the industry's broadest portfolio of low- and zero-emissions, allowing customers to meet emissions regulations in a way that also best meets their business needs."", 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-inc Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cummins Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward."", ""Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' View our latest analysis for Exelon ', ""As Exelon operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%. Compared to the current share price of US$38.3, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$1.7 / (6.1% – 2.4%)', '= US$44.6', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exelon as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electric Utilities industry.', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions, and any impact from geopolitical developments."", ""Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 9th, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events, or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. I will now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton."", ""Tom Leighton : Thanks, Mark. Akamai got off to a strong start for the year with our Security and Compute portfolios. And we continued to experience industry headwinds with our delivery product-line. First quarter revenue grew to $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.64, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. The fast growing parts of our business, security and cloud computing, grew to represent almost two-thirds of total revenue in Q1, and combined they grew 22% over Q1 of 2023. The continued shift in Akamai's revenue mix towards security and compute, is a clear indicator that our growth strategy is achieving the intended results."", ""We continue to successfully leverage the market leadership and cashflow of our delivery product line to invest in our faster growing and more profitable security and cloud computing portfolios. And we are excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us, especially with our planned acquisition of Noname Security, which we announced this week. I'll say more about Noname in a minute. But first, looking at our security portfolio more broadly, security revenue grew 21% year-over-year in Q1 to $491 million, driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore Segmentation Solution. Customers who purchased Segmentation from Akamai in Q1 included one of the top telcos in the US, a supermarket chain with more than 1,500 stores across Canada, and a major business management software company in Latin America."", ""Our Zero Trust Network Access Solution, is also seeing good traction. For example, the United States Army announced last month that it selected Akamai for Zero Trust Security in Battlefield Networks. After a competitive evaluation of more than 40 vendors, the Army will use Akamai for its tactical identity, credential, and access management to enhance defenses in high-risk operational environments and limit network access to authorized users, devices, applications, and services. In response to customer requests to bring our Enterprise Zero Trust solutions together into a single platform, we've integrated Guardicore with our other enterprise security solutions to form our recently announced Akamai Guardicore platform. This new platform is the first of its kind to enable Zero Trust Security through a fully integrated combination of micro segmentation, Zero Trust Network Access, multi-factor authentication, DNS firewall, and threat hunting."", 'All designed to strengthen and simplify enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls through a single console. We think it will appeal to customers looking to consolidate security vendors and integrate their security tools. We also continue to see strong customer interests in our app and API security solutions. Customers who purchased Akamai API Security in Q1, included a major consumer financial services company, a US supermarket chain with more than 1,200 stores, and a leading US manufacturer of electric vehicles. Last month, one of our largest customers, a well-known hyperscaler, was hit with a massive denial-of-service attack, 24 million requests per minute. Using our rate controls and custom web app firewall rules, the customer successfully forwarded 99.999% of the attack traffic.', ""That's five nines of protection. The customer was delighted, telling us, “that's an A-plus by just about every calculation”. Unlike some of our competitors who struggled to defend against far smaller DDoS attacks in recent months, Akamai is capable of protecting even the hyperscalers. The scale of Akamai defenses and the depth of our expertise really matter for customers, who named Akamai a Customer's Choice for the fifth-year in a row in the new Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customers report for cloud web app and API protection. And soon, our suite of app and API security solutions will become even stronger with the planned acquisition of Noname Security. The use of APIs has exploded in nearly every industry, driven by digital transformation, the widespread adoption of mobile phones and IoT devices, and the increased sharing of data between third-party providers."", ""The increasing use of APIs also opens up new threat vectors for attackers and the need for API security. For example, we saw API attacks on our platform more than double from January 2023 to January 2024. And IDC Research now predicts that the API security market will grow at a CAGR of 34% to nearly a $1 billion by 2027. That's one reason why we are so excited about our plan to acquire Noname, as we accelerate our momentum in this fast growing segment. As one of the market leading API security offerings, Noname delivers visibility into API business logic abuse and contextual awareness between API requests and responses to ensure that anomalous traffic is detected, inspected, and blocked when warranted. We believe that the addition of Noname to our API security solution will offer Akamai customers enhanced attack analysis, more flexible deployment options, and extensive vendor integrations."", ""Ed will share some financial details about the acquisition shortly. Turning now to cloud computing, I'm pleased to say that 2024 is off to a great start, with strong early momentum across multiple verticals. Customers are excited about our differentiated cloud platform, which offers superior performance through a more distributed footprint, cloud diversification, and lower costs. Examples of major enterprises using our cloud computing platform now include one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, several global auto manufacturers, several large direct-to-consumer and OTT providers, several global SaaS providers, numerous travel and hospitality companies, including one of the world's largest cruise lines and a large airline in Asia, one of the largest credit unions in the US."", ""A multinational financial services company. An iconic global corporation that manufactures and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. A European cyber security company, and a leading ad tech company. Just this week, we signed up one of the world's best known media companies to a two-year deal worth several million dollars per year for compute. Yet another great example of major enterprises using our new cloud computing platform is Sony Group. Sony is excited about Akamai's investment into Edge Compute and has multiple latency-sensitive compute workloads that are running on Akamai. Current use cases include PlayStation.com, leveraging Edge Compute to improve search engine optimization, and PlayStation Direct, leveraging Edge Compute to ensure a fair experience for customers purchasing PlayStation Hardware."", ""We're also seeing strong early traction with our Independent Software Vendor, or ISV, partners. They offer solutions that run on our compute platform in which our go-to-market teams co-sell to help customers solve big challenges with a better together solution. For example, a media workflow provider, which powers OTT video, now offers its live encoder solution on Akamai Connected Cloud. The solution is designed to increase efficiency for large scale streaming while also lowering egress fees, by as much as 90% according to their calculations. Joint customers of the offering include OneFootball, one of the world's biggest digital soccer platforms, backed by clubs such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich. In partnership with an observability solution provider, we won cloud computing deals in Q1 with one of the world's leading gaming companies, a leading luxury goods brand in Europe and one of India's largest conglomerates."", 'Their solution powers observability using Akamai Cloud computing and enables real-time data ingestion at scale, lightning fast query performance, and extensive data retention at a fraction of the cost of other platforms. Another ISV partner that is providing distributed database services, enabled a well-known online travel marketplace to go live in Q1, with a geolocation implementation that uses Akamai’s Edge Computing to execute code at the edge for optimal performance. The travel site invoked more than 68 billion Edge Compute instances in March alone. By the end of Q1, we had over 200 customers spending $36,000 or more in Annual Recurring Revenue for our new compute services, with about half spending $100,000 or more, and six spending over $1 million per year, all just for compute.', ""All of these customer counts are triple what we had in Q1 of last year. Collectively, these customers are spending over $50 million annually coming out of Q1 for our new cloud computing solutions, which is up more than 4 times year-over-year. Beginning this quarter, our global enterprise cloud sales team is now led by Dan Lawrence, who joined us from AWS, where he ran data and analytics for its private equity segment. Before that, Dan ran the Americas analytics business for five customer segments, including gaming and high-tech SaaS. Dan joined Akamai for the potential he sees to combine Akamai's trusted brand and Edge Computing platform with the large market opportunity and distributed cloud. I'll now say a few words about content delivery, which represents a little over one-third of our overall revenue."", ""Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure, and near-flawless digital experiences. That said, our delivery revenue was less than expected in Q1, due to slowing traffic growth across the industry, and a large social media customer that is now optimizing their business to reduce costs. As a result, and as Ed will discuss shortly, we now expect our delivery revenue to decline at a higher rate this year. As we've noted before, delivery continues to generate profits that we use to fuel our future growth. It also helps our security and cloud computing portfolios, as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security, and compute on the same platform."", ""Of course, we are not happy to see the declining revenue in our delivery portfolio. And while it remains difficult to predict exactly when that business will begin to stabilize, we believe that Akamai’s CDN remains a critical enabler of doing business on the internet. This has been the case for the past 25 years, and we remain convinced that businesses will continue to need Akamai's superior scale, reliability, and security in the future as they migrate more workloads to the cloud, seek to secure their internal and external applications, and look to unlock the promise of AI, often while also leveraging Akamai security and compute capabilities. Moreover, given the exciting growth we're seeing in our security and compute portfolios, we believe it is only a matter of time before these businesses drive accelerating revenue growth for Akamai as a whole."", ""In summary, we are pleased by the strong performance of our security and compute portfolios to start the year. And we are very excited about our potential for future growth and profitability, as we add Noname to our security portfolio and as our fast-growing compute portfolio contributes a larger share of revenue. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 in the full year. Ed?"", 'Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today I plan to review our Q1 results and then provide some color on our Q2 expectations in our updated full year 2024 guidance, along with the financial impact of our recently announced acquisition of Noname Security. Before we get into that, I wanted to address a few items, including what Tom mentioned in his remarks, that have caused us to reduce our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, the US Dollar has strengthened significantly since the start of the year. As we have noted on many prior calls, foreign exchange fluctuations can significantly impact our top and bottom lines. Based on the strength of the US dollar, we now expect FX to have a negative impact of approximately $40 million on our top-line outlook for the full year 2024.', 'That translates to a negative impact of approximately $0.12 to our expected non-GAAP EPS for 2024. In addition, we expect this will negatively impact our full year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 basis points. Second, as Tom mentioned, a large social media customer has recently taken steps to lower its costs through a series of optimizations across its platform. As a result, they have reduced their overall traffic. Therefore, we now expect approximately $40 million to $60 million less revenue from this customer for the full year than we previously thought. This change will primarily impact our delivery product line. Finally, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, in addition to the large social media customer, we have seen lower than expected traffic in our delivery business over the past two months, most notably in gaming and video.', ""This is in-line with similar patterns that were cited earlier this week in a research note from a leading Wall Street bank that stated, video streaming services were seeing a drop in downloads, in active users during April. The note also mentioned that weakness was coming from streaming service providers pushing for ad-supported versions and password sharing crackdowns to stay ahead in the streaming wars. As a result of these recent market conditions, it's prudent to assume that this traffic weakness will continue for the remainder of 2024. This lower traffic outlook would translate into approximately $20 million to $30 million less delivery revenue for the remainder of the year than we previously expected. The good news is that in contrast to some other competitors in the industry, both our delivery business and the overall company continue to be highly profitable."", 'As a result, the significant cash flows we generate give us the financial flexibility to execute strategic acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, invest in our future growth, and further diversify our business away from delivery and into the faster growing and even more profitable areas of security and compute. Turning now to our first quarter results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our two fastest growing offerings, Compute and Security, grew 22% year-over-year on a combined basis and now represent 64% of total revenue. Compute revenue was $145 million, up 25% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, we have more than 200 enterprise customers using our cloud computing solutions.', ""Our offerings clearly resonate well with customers and we remain optimistic about the early traction we see from large enterprise businesses. It's worth noting that the annual run rate of our enterprise compute revenue is now over $50 million and is growing at over 300% year-over-year. Security revenue was $491 million. Security revenue grew 21% year-over-year as reported, and in constant currency. We are very pleased by our continued performance with our Guardicore Zero Trust Solution and highly encouraged by the traction we are seeing in our recently launched API security solution. Moving to delivery. Revenue was $352 million, which declined 11% year-over-year as reported and 10% in constant currency. International revenue was $475 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q1."", ""Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a negative $4 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. And finally, our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 30%. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.3 billion. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $125 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. We now have roughly $400 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback authorization. As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new buyback program of up to $2 billion effective today in running through the end of June, 2027."", 'Combining the two authorizations, we currently have roughly $2.4 billion available for share repurchases. Our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Earlier this week, we announced our intent to acquire Noname security for approximately $450 million. We believe this acquisition demonstrates our continued balance approach to capital allocation by opportunistically buying back shares over time, while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Before I provide our Q2 and full year 2024 guidance, I wanted to touch on some housekeeping items. First, regarding our planned acquisition of Noname Security.', 'We expect this transaction to add approximately $20 million in revenue for the full year, to be diluted to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.10, and to be diluted to non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. We expect that the acquisition will close sometime in June. We do not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on Q2 results. And as a reminder, our updated full-year guidance includes the impact of the acquisition. Finally, specific to traffic, we expect a modest uptick in media traffic in Q3, primarily due to the Olympics. This event is expected to drive approximately $3 million to $4 million of additional revenue in the third quarter. And while Q4 is typically our strongest quarter seasonally, we saw a more muted impact of that seasonality last year.', 'We expect that we will see a similar result this year. So with those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in a range of $967 million to $986 million or up 3% to 5% as reported, and 4% to 6% in constant currency over Q2 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $5 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $9 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $302 million to $307 million. We expect Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 41% to 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $126 million to $128 million.', 'And we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $175 million to $183 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and cost, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.51 to $1.56. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $59 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3,950 million to $4,020 million, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as [reported now] (ph) 4% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024, including the contribution from the acquisition of Noname.', 'With a strong start for our compute offerings in Q1, we now expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 21% to 23% in constant currency for the full year 2024. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29%. We now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.20 to $6.40. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on the non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%, and fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of total revenue. This updated CapEx is higher than our original expectations outlined last quarter due to our lower revenue outlook, slightly higher software capitalization rates across the business as more work is being done on capitalized projects and higher than expected server component costs, driven primarily by NAND storage pricing in certain servers that support our cloud computing buildup.', 'In closing, we are pleased with our progress in security and compute to start the year. Tom and I would be very happy to take your questions.

Baked into the forward guidance are expectations for a revenue decline in the first half of the year as 7 out of 10 CDN (content delivery network) customers renew their contract.

It is also investment-grade rated and has a broad geographic reach with operations in the United States and Europe. Even if the company's growth slows down, Realty Income is highly likely to muddle through to better days while continuing to reward investors all along the way. Notably, the dividend has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years."", 'Unlike Realty Income, industrial REIT Rexford is not the biggest name within its property type. But it is one of the most dominant players in the Southern California market where it has chosen to focus its investment efforts. Industrial REITs were all the rage during the pandemic because warehouse space was in high demand. Wall Street has moved on from that story as demand has begun to cool. The stock is down over 45% from peak levels in 2022. With rising interest rates and a slowdown in the industrial property niche, that makes sense.', ""Only Rexford is still passing on sizable rent increases as leases renew. It also has notable plans to redevelop assets already in its portfolio so it can charge more rent. The Southern California market is one of the best industrial markets in the United States. In other words, it looks a bit like Rexford got caught up in a Wall Street fad that's now over, but nothing has really changed about the REIT's long-term story. Meanwhile, the stock decline resulted in a near decade-high dividend yield of 3.7%. Note that the dividend has been increased annually for 11 consecutive years with a very rapid 16% annualized growth rate over the past decade."", ""Public Storage and Rexford have similar stories, as demand for self-storage units picked up during the pandemic and then cooled off. The stock has lost around a third of its value since reaching a high-water mark in 2022. The interesting thing is that self-storage units tend to be fairly low-maintenance and highly sticky. Not many people want to move their belongings just to save a few bucks. The bigger issue is that demand has led to an increase in supply, so there's more competition for new customers. With a market cap of around $45 billion, Public Storage is one of the biggest players in the industry, so this is a headwind. This backstory helps explain the historically high 4.5% dividend yield."", ""To be fair, Public Storage's adjusted funds from operations (FFO) was down about 1% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. But with a massive portfolio of over 2,500 locations, Public Storage is well positioned to remain a dominant player in the storage sector and may even end up acting as a consolidator. Longer-term, demand seems likely to remain robust with the elevated cost of housing leaving many consumers locked out of buying a new, perhaps larger, home for their growing piles of stuff. The dividend hasn't been increased every year, but it has trended higher over time. If you like buying industry leaders while they are unloved, this could be your opportunity to buy Public Storage."", ""There are a lot of REITs that have been put on the sale rack right now; Realty Income, Rexford Industrial, and Public Storage are just three of them. But they offer unique stories, with two being flat-out industry giants and one being a giant in an attractive geographic market. If you are trying to find stocks that are on sale, all three should be on your shortlist for a deeper dive. It's likely that one or more could end up in your portfolio this year."", 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has lost 3.9% over this period.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of +132.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.80 points to a change of +118% from the prior year.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +76.4%.

The company holds a dominant market position, controlling over 50% of the market for lab balances. Geographically diversified, Mettler-Toledo garners about 30% of its sales from the United States, 30% from Europe, 20% from China, and the remaining 20% from other parts of the world.', 'The company reported flat sales compared to the previous year, with total revenue amounting to $925.9 million. This stability in sales reflects the recovery of delayed shipments from Q4 2023, which positively impacted the revenue by 6%. However, regional performance varied, with sales in Europe and the Americas experiencing growth, while Asia and the Rest of the World saw a decline.', ""Net earnings per diluted share (EPS) for the quarter stood at $8.24, a slight decrease from $8.47 in the same period last year. The adjusted EPS, which excludes certain non-recurring items, was $8.89, marking a 2% increase from the previous year's $8.69. This adjustment reflects the company's ongoing efforts to optimize its cost structure and enhance productivity amidst challenging market conditions."", ""Despite the flat sales growth, Mettler-Toledo demonstrated strong operational performance with an adjusted operating profit of $267.3 million, slightly up from $266.5 million in the prior year. The company's focus on productivity and cost-saving initiatives has been crucial in mitigating the impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations and other external challenges."", ""President and CEO Patrick Kaltenbach highlighted the company's robust execution and strategic measures which have been essential in navigating reduced market demand, particularly in China. Kaltenbach remains optimistic about the company's growth strategies and product innovations moving forward."", 'Looking ahead, Mettler-Toledo anticipates a challenging second quarter in 2024, with expected local currency sales to decline by approximately 4%. The adjusted EPS for the upcoming quarter is projected to be between $8.90 and $9.05, reflecting an 11% to 13% decrease, influenced partly by currency headwinds. For the full year, the company expects a modest increase in local currency sales and adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 6%.', ""As Mettler-Toledo continues to adapt to dynamic market conditions and execute its long-term growth strategies, the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the precision instrument industry. Investors and stakeholders are encouraged to attend the upcoming conference call, detailed on the company's investor relations page, to discuss these results and future plans more comprehensively."", 'Explore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Mettler-Toledo International Inc for further details.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Applebee’s and Chili’s are moving in,CNN Business,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/85babbe1-0779-3916-b572-d27f15ef4acd/fast-food-is-expensive..html,1715418003,STORY,['MCD'],"['McDonald’s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.', '“You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”', 'If Peyton’s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.', 'For a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they’re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out.', 'That means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.', 'Because fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.', 'The overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.', 'Applebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.', 'For them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.', 'Years of price hikes have\xa0contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.', '“It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said.\xa0“You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”', 'Fast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”', 'In the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.', 'A few years ago, McDonald’s\xa0said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.', 'CEO Chris Kempczinski said\xa0during a February analyst call\xa0that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded\xa0during another analyst call\xa0that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”', 'The chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg.', 'Things aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.', 'Sales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year\xa0slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.', '“For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”', 'He added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”', 'With fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.', 'People have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns. Chili’s has been paying attention.', '“Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.', 'The chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.', 'On X, Chili’s asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.', 'But it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said Henkes.', 'One problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.', '“People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.', 'Still, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap.', '“Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

On the company’s first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said McDonald’s had to be “laser-focused on affordability” given how price-weary diners have become. The company’s results were weaker than expected.', '“What we don’t have in the US right now is a national value platform,” Kempczinski said, prompting questions from analysts about what such an offer might entail.', 'McDonald’s shares rose as much as 2.7%, the most since January 2023, in New York trading Friday after Bloomberg’s initial report of the meal-deal effort. Wendy’s Co. fell as much as 3.7%, and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. slid 1.3%.', 'At McDonald’s, franchisees pay into an advertising fund and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns, including promotions such as the viral Grimace Shake. A prior attempt to get operators — who run about 95% of US stores — to endorse the $5 meal initiative failed earlier this year, the person said.', 'Some operators were concerned about losing money on the roughly four-week promotion, particularly in states such as California, where the minimum wage for fast-food workers jumped 25% to $20 an hour earlier this year. McDonald’s has said that franchisee cash flows are up about 50% since 2018 and are still on the rise, though an independent group representing operators has raised concerns about the cost of labor and investments to freshen up stores.', 'To sweeten the deal, McDonald’s enlisted money from Coca-Cola Co. that could help cushion a potential profitability hit for franchisees, the person familiar said. The size of the beverage company’s contribution hasn’t been decided, and the burger chain wasn’t expected to put up funds. Coca-Cola, which often contributes to customers’ marketing programs, declined to comment.', 'McDonald’s declined to elaborate beyond Kempczinski’s prior comments. John Palmaccio, the chairman of the operators’ advertising fund, said in a statement to Bloomberg News that the company, franchisees and suppliers are coming together to deliver “great value and affordability” now that “our customers really need it.”', 'Catching Up', 'After years of solid sales and traffic results, McDonald’s is now grappling with a pullback from low-income consumers, who account for a substantial portion of its clientele.', 'Kempczinski bemoaned in the most recent earnings call that the company was offering local deals and bundles rather than national promotions, as some competitors do. Burger King, for example, has a limited-time $5 duo, and Wendy’s a two-for-$3 breakfast deal.', '“McDonald’s has had such strong sales in recent years that they didn’t really need it,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research, which focuses on restaurants. “Now that the consumer has shown by action that they’re demanding value more than they were even six months ago, McDonald’s is changing with the times.”', 'Earlier this year, the independent franchisee group urged the company to bring back the discontinued snack wraps, arguing they’re “craveable, relatively simple to produce” and could “easily satisfy the call for more affordable options on the menu.” The organization cautioned against discounting the chain’s “iconic” menu items and nudged the company to expand its beverage lineup.

His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, first bought shares of Coke stock in 1988 and owns 400 million shares."", ""The big news revealed at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting last week was that it had sold 13% of its stake in Apple. While that sounds significant, and is, Apple remains the company's largest position by far, moving down from around 50% to 40% of the total portfolio. However, even though Buffett said Apple was a better business than Coca-Cola and American Express, his other longtime favorite, he has never sold a share of Coke or American Express."", ""Let's see what he said about Coca-Cola and how that might influence your opinion of it as an investor."", ""Buffett often groups Coca-Cola and American Express together. He praises their dominance and how they've carved out exceptional niches in their industries, with strong moats and leadership. Recently, he's added Apple to create a trio of favorite stocks, or as he would say, businesses. He reiterated that he invests in businesses, not stocks, and explained that longtime partner Charlie Munger, who passed away last year, helped him shift his mindset to investigating a business instead of paying attention to the market."", '""And that\'s sort of the story of why we own American Express, which is a wonderful business,"" he said. ""We own Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business, and we own Apple, which is an even better business.""', 'He gave a further explanation for what it is about Coca-Cola that he finds so compelling:', ""No company hardly does business around the world like Coca-Cola. I mean, they are the preferred soft drink. You know, something maybe like 170 or 180 out of 200 countries. Those are rough approximations from a few years back, probably, but that degree of acceptance worldwide is, I think it's almost unmatched."", ""Coca-Cola's global acceptance means that it enjoys high sales and makes it very hard to beat. That's a moat that ensures its survival, and so long as the company keeps it strong, Coca-Cola should continue to perform well, keep up its dividend, and grow."", ""Coca-Cola remains the largest beverage company in the world, with $46 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. It has successfully raised prices on many of its products because loyal customers are willing to spend for their favorite drink. That's the kind of brand Coca-Cola has developed over time. It has forged relationships with customers that lead to reliable sales, providing it with resilience during rough times. This is the quality that Buffett is describing."", 'Management recently made some changes to become an even stronger company. It removed half of its brands, about 200 in total. These were mostly local brands that accounted for less than 2% of volume and 1% of revenue. Consider that: Half of its brands were accounting for less 1% of sales. No wonder management decided to do away with them and refocus resources on better-performing brands.', ""This is what Buffett is talking about when he mentions that Coca-Cola is a global company. The stronger a company's global brand presence, the harder it is to topple from its perch. The more Coca-Cola focuses on its large, global, core brands, the stronger it becomes."", 'Investors can talk about quarterly earnings and profitability and change their positions accordingly. Or you can think about the business the way Buffett does. ""It\'s such a simple approach that it\'s almost deceptive,"" he said. ""Most things, if you keep working harder and harder at it ... but investments, you don\'t really have to do that. You really have to have your mind set properly.""', 'This is a useful paradigm when considering any stock. It can help investors think outside of the near-term box and focus on the long term, where investors can reap the real gains of successful investing.', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

These improvements have allowed us to rely on a single rig for a portion of the year while still delivering double-digit volume growth. We completed four wells and brought six wells online during the period, benefiting from two drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, from late 2023.

This will expand our existing operating footprint in New Mexico by adding 13,900 contiguous net acres.', 'The acreage is largely underdeveloped but is 99% held by production through legacy vertical wells.

We remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders and delivering predictable and sustainable growth for years to come.

As usual, investors are gleaning all they can from the comments made by chief Warren Buffett during the event. And well they should. He may be 93 years old, but he's still one of the world's sharpest stock-pickers."", ""However, copying every trade Berkshire Hathaway makes probably isn't feasible for most investors. If you only want to poach a few picks from the Oracle of Omaha, here are three of your best bets at this time."", ""It's a painfully predictable pick. That doesn't mean The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) isn't a great company for most investors, though. In fact, it's a commonly suggested stock specifically because it's such a great one to own."", ""The company is, of course, the name behind the world's single most popular soda. Coca-Cola is only part of its soda lineup, however. The Coca-Cola Company also owns carbonated beverage brands Sprite, Schweppes ginger ale, and Barq's root beer. Its non-carbonated drinks include Minute Maid juice, Golf Peak tea, and Dasani water, just to name a few. It's got a product for every consumer preference, explaining its relatively consistent top- and bottom-line results... and its reliable growth."", ""The familiarity of Coca-Cola's brand names isn't the ultimate reason investors should consider owning a stake in the company. The crux of the bullish argument here is the underlying reason the company is a beverage behemoth. That is, The Coca-Cola Company is a brilliant marketer and advertiser. It's not simply selling drinks. Its brands are a lifestyle choice, and in some ways they're woven into the fabric of our culture."", 'Don\'t see it? Consider this: How many other brand names and logos do you see incorporated into fashion, holiday ornaments, home décor, and outright art? Older investors can probably even still remember all the lyrics to the ""I\'d like to teach the world to sing"" song written specifically for one of the company\'s branding campaigns. It became a conventional hit song after it was a Coca-Cola TV commercial jingle.', ""Songs don't directly generate revenue, of course, and even great advertising jingles eventually get tired. This is the sort of marketing magic The Coca-Cola Company's been able to successfully replicate for decades."", ""The kicker: In February the company raised the stock's annualized dividend payment for a 62nd consecutive year. Better still, despite Coke stock's recent strength, the dividend yield still currently stands at a compelling 3.1%."", ""Many investors may feel that one energy company is just as good as another. To be fair, that's not an entirely misguided assumption -- oil and gas are oil and gas, after all. All energy companies are seemingly exploring, drilling, extracting, and refining it in the same basic way."", ""There are distinct differences between these companies, though. They're just different in ways that aren't necessarily easy to see."", ""Enter Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)... one of only two oil and gas businesses Warren Buffett likes well enough right now to leave parked in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The fund owns a little over 248 million shares of Oxy collectively worth nearly $16 billion. That's roughly one-fourth the entirety of the energy company."", ""It's also one of a handful of companies specifically mentioned by name in Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire shareholders penned and posted in February of this year. Buffett said of the pick he's been holding since 2019:"", ""Under [CEO] Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country."", 'Warren Buffett adds of Oxy: ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives.""', ""And he's right. While it's often difficult to see, Hollub is investing in the right exploration and production projects, and divesting the ones that don't quite fit. For example, in December Occidental announced it would be acquiring CrownRock to expand its exposure to the Permian Basin, but it's also already looking to sell the Barilla Draw (Texas) sliver of that purchase."", ""Even less obvious is the fact that Hollub is one of the few energy chiefs who recognizes that the industry is underinvesting to meet the world's oil and gas needs just a couple of years from now. Seeing an opportunity, she's positioning Occidental Petroleum now to be able to meet that demand then."", 'If you can be as patient as Buffett is, you should be well rewarded for it.', 'Last but not least, add The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) to your list of no-brainer Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.', 'It\'s an eyebrow-raising suggestion. This is one of Berkshire Hathaway\'s rare misfires, after all, leading Buffett to admit in 2019 that ""we overpaid for Kraft"" when melding it with Heinz in 2015.', ""Many of the operational and fiscal kinks linked to the deal are now being worked out, but new challenges have surfaced in the meantime. Inflation is the biggest of these headaches. Kraft Heinz's revenue fell slightly last quarter, largely because people are balking at the company's most recent round of price hikes. The total volume of food sold during the three-month stretch in question fell a little over 3%. Shares fell -- again -- on the alarming implications of the report."", ""There's something not being considered by the majority of investors, though. That is, inflation is cooling off, and the economy is still growing... even if at a snail's pace. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes overall food price growth within the United States will decelerate to a modest 2.2% this year, making food at least seem more affordable to buy and sell. To this end, The Kraft Heinz Company's 2024 revenue-growth guidance of between nil and 2% still holds water, as does its comparable outlook for profit growth. After that, the organization can really begin flexing its brands' marketing muscles again."", 'Or, think about Buffett\'s sage advice to ""buy unpopular stocks"" while they\'re unpopular. Said another way (again in Buffett\'s words), ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" There\'s certainly plenty of fear surrounding Kraft Heinz stock right now.', ""Whatever your motivation is, newcomers will be stepping into this stock while the dividend yield's a healthy 4.4%. That's based on a dividend payment, by the way, that's still more than easily covered by real, actual earnings."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Once finalized, the new 13-person board of directors will each serve a one-year term expiring in 2025.', 'Norfolk Southern said it would elect a new chair at its next meeting, to be scheduled in the coming weeks.', 'While Shaw gets a second wind, he will be under more pressure with the new board in place, as investors made it clear that they thought some of Ancora’s claims had some merit.', 'Beyond getting past the $1.1 billion derailment, which generated criticism from residents, lawmakers and investors alike and provoked some questions about the safety of U.S. railroad operations, Norfolk Southern has to address declining service levels and poor earnings results compared to other Class I railroads.', 'Ancora had long argued that the rail had to establish infrastructure to support the precision scheduled railroading (PSR) operating model, instead of its current “resilience railroading” strategy. The hedge fund said that under its own CEO candidate to replace Shaw, former UPS executive Jim Barber, it planned to incorporate a more traditional framework for PSR that would help cut the company’s operating ratio from 67.4 percent of revenue to 57 percent within three years.', 'Norfolk Southern said it also would reach a sub-60 percent operating ratio, but it would take a year longer than Ancora’s plan. The plan would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years. The company’s resilience strategy relies in part on not furloughing train crews during downturns like the current ongoing freight recession so the railroad could maintain service and capture volume in a rebound.', 'However, it is likely that certain elements of PSR will be further implemented with the Norfolk Southern strategy going forward. One of the three new board members voted in Thursday, Sameh Fahmy, is a former executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading at Kansas City Southern—suggesting that there will be some new influence on how the company’s operating model will be carried out.', 'With the vote, the rail company also staved off the replacement of newly appointed chief operating officer John Orr with former CSX executive vice president of operations Jamie Boychuk.', 'Norfolk Southern defeated an effort that was backed in part by one of the major proxy advisors, Glass Lewis, while counterpart ISS recommended to keep Shaw in place. Ancora also had the support of multiple labor unions, including separate divisions of the Teamsters, as well as one of its largest customers, steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs.', 'Ancora called the changes “meaningful,” saying it would keep holding Shaw accountable and push for the appointment of a qualified operator “who can actually drive shareholder value.”', '“This represents a loud and clear message to replace the company’s unqualified CEO and reconsider its ineffective strategy, which has driven industry-worst customer delivery times, severe derailments and persistent share price underperformance,” read a statement from Ancora chairman and CEO Frederick DiSanto, and James Chadwick, president of Ancora Alternatives. “Notably, CEO Alan Shaw received what we deem a resounding vote of no confidence based on preliminary voting results that indicate he barely received support from holders of 50 percent of the company’s outstanding shares.”', 'On the other hand, more unions have come out in favor of the vote. The Transportation Trades Department (TTD) of the AFL-CIO, which is a coalition of 37 transportation- and logistics-related unions that threw support behind Shaw, applauded the vote.', '“While we certainly do not agree with Mr. Shaw on everything, we asked for him to remain because we believe he has made meaningful safety improvements since the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio last year,” said Greg Regan, president of the TTD of the AFL-CIO in a statement. “We also believe his leadership would better serve rail customers, workers, and Shareholders in the long run. Any way you slice it, Mr. Shaw is better than Ancora’s proposed alternative.”', 'Among the new directors elected to Norfolk Southern’s board were the railroad’s own nominees Richard Anderson, former CEO of passenger railway Amtrak, and former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp.', 'Aside from Fahmy, the Ancora-supported board electees include former U.S. Surface Transportation Board commissioner and vice chairman William Clyburn, Jr. and Gilbert Lamphere, chairman of MidRail Corporation and co-founder of MidSouth Rail Corporation.']"

His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, first bought shares of Coke stock in 1988 and owns 400 million shares."", ""The big news revealed at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting last week was that it had sold 13% of its stake in Apple. While that sounds significant, and is, Apple remains the company's largest position by far, moving down from around 50% to 40% of the total portfolio. However, even though Buffett said Apple was a better business than Coca-Cola and American Express, his other longtime favorite, he has never sold a share of Coke or American Express."", ""Let's see what he said about Coca-Cola and how that might influence your opinion of it as an investor."", ""Buffett often groups Coca-Cola and American Express together. He praises their dominance and how they've carved out exceptional niches in their industries, with strong moats and leadership. Recently, he's added Apple to create a trio of favorite stocks, or as he would say, businesses. He reiterated that he invests in businesses, not stocks, and explained that longtime partner Charlie Munger, who passed away last year, helped him shift his mindset to investigating a business instead of paying attention to the market."", '""And that\'s sort of the story of why we own American Express, which is a wonderful business,"" he said. ""We own Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business, and we own Apple, which is an even better business.""', 'He gave a further explanation for what it is about Coca-Cola that he finds so compelling:', ""No company hardly does business around the world like Coca-Cola. I mean, they are the preferred soft drink. You know, something maybe like 170 or 180 out of 200 countries. Those are rough approximations from a few years back, probably, but that degree of acceptance worldwide is, I think it's almost unmatched."", ""Coca-Cola's global acceptance means that it enjoys high sales and makes it very hard to beat. That's a moat that ensures its survival, and so long as the company keeps it strong, Coca-Cola should continue to perform well, keep up its dividend, and grow."", ""Coca-Cola remains the largest beverage company in the world, with $46 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. It has successfully raised prices on many of its products because loyal customers are willing to spend for their favorite drink. That's the kind of brand Coca-Cola has developed over time. It has forged relationships with customers that lead to reliable sales, providing it with resilience during rough times. This is the quality that Buffett is describing."", 'Management recently made some changes to become an even stronger company. It removed half of its brands, about 200 in total. These were mostly local brands that accounted for less than 2% of volume and 1% of revenue. Consider that: Half of its brands were accounting for less 1% of sales. No wonder management decided to do away with them and refocus resources on better-performing brands.', ""This is what Buffett is talking about when he mentions that Coca-Cola is a global company. The stronger a company's global brand presence, the harder it is to topple from its perch. The more Coca-Cola focuses on its large, global, core brands, the stronger it becomes."", 'Investors can talk about quarterly earnings and profitability and change their positions accordingly. Or you can think about the business the way Buffett does. ""It\'s such a simple approach that it\'s almost deceptive,"" he said. ""Most things, if you keep working harder and harder at it ... but investments, you don\'t really have to do that. You really have to have your mind set properly.""', 'This is a useful paradigm when considering any stock.

As usual, investors are gleaning all they can from the comments made by chief Warren Buffett during the event. And well they should. He may be 93 years old, but he's still one of the world's sharpest stock-pickers."", ""However, copying every trade Berkshire Hathaway makes probably isn't feasible for most investors. If you only want to poach a few picks from the Oracle of Omaha, here are three of your best bets at this time."", ""It's a painfully predictable pick. That doesn't mean The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) isn't a great company for most investors, though. In fact, it's a commonly suggested stock specifically because it's such a great one to own."", ""The company is, of course, the name behind the world's single most popular soda. Coca-Cola is only part of its soda lineup, however. The Coca-Cola Company also owns carbonated beverage brands Sprite, Schweppes ginger ale, and Barq's root beer. Its non-carbonated drinks include Minute Maid juice, Golf Peak tea, and Dasani water, just to name a few. It's got a product for every consumer preference, explaining its relatively consistent top- and bottom-line results... and its reliable growth."", ""The familiarity of Coca-Cola's brand names isn't the ultimate reason investors should consider owning a stake in the company. The crux of the bullish argument here is the underlying reason the company is a beverage behemoth. That is, The Coca-Cola Company is a brilliant marketer and advertiser. It's not simply selling drinks. Its brands are a lifestyle choice, and in some ways they're woven into the fabric of our culture."", 'Don\'t see it? Consider this: How many other brand names and logos do you see incorporated into fashion, holiday ornaments, home décor, and outright art? Older investors can probably even still remember all the lyrics to the ""I\'d like to teach the world to sing"" song written specifically for one of the company\'s branding campaigns. It became a conventional hit song after it was a Coca-Cola TV commercial jingle.', ""Songs don't directly generate revenue, of course, and even great advertising jingles eventually get tired. This is the sort of marketing magic The Coca-Cola Company's been able to successfully replicate for decades."", ""The kicker: In February the company raised the stock's annualized dividend payment for a 62nd consecutive year. Better still, despite Coke stock's recent strength, the dividend yield still currently stands at a compelling 3.1%."", ""Many investors may feel that one energy company is just as good as another. To be fair, that's not an entirely misguided assumption -- oil and gas are oil and gas, after all. All energy companies are seemingly exploring, drilling, extracting, and refining it in the same basic way."", ""There are distinct differences between these companies, though. They're just different in ways that aren't necessarily easy to see."", ""Enter Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)... one of only two oil and gas businesses Warren Buffett likes well enough right now to leave parked in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The fund owns a little over 248 million shares of Oxy collectively worth nearly $16 billion. That's roughly one-fourth the entirety of the energy company."", ""It's also one of a handful of companies specifically mentioned by name in Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire shareholders penned and posted in February of this year. Buffett said of the pick he's been holding since 2019:"", ""Under [CEO] Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country."", 'Warren Buffett adds of Oxy: ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives.""', ""And he's right. While it's often difficult to see, Hollub is investing in the right exploration and production projects, and divesting the ones that don't quite fit. For example, in December Occidental announced it would be acquiring CrownRock to expand its exposure to the Permian Basin, but it's also already looking to sell the Barilla Draw (Texas) sliver of that purchase."", ""Even less obvious is the fact that Hollub is one of the few energy chiefs who recognizes that the industry is underinvesting to meet the world's oil and gas needs just a couple of years from now. Seeing an opportunity, she's positioning Occidental Petroleum now to be able to meet that demand then."", 'If you can be as patient as Buffett is, you should be well rewarded for it.', 'Last but not least, add The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) to your list of no-brainer Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.', 'It\'s an eyebrow-raising suggestion. This is one of Berkshire Hathaway\'s rare misfires, after all, leading Buffett to admit in 2019 that ""we overpaid for Kraft"" when melding it with Heinz in 2015.', ""Many of the operational and fiscal kinks linked to the deal are now being worked out, but new challenges have surfaced in the meantime. Inflation is the biggest of these headaches. Kraft Heinz's revenue fell slightly last quarter, largely because people are balking at the company's most recent round of price hikes. The total volume of food sold during the three-month stretch in question fell a little over 3%. Shares fell -- again -- on the alarming implications of the report."", ""There's something not being considered by the majority of investors, though. That is, inflation is cooling off, and the economy is still growing... even if at a snail's pace. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes overall food price growth within the United States will decelerate to a modest 2.2% this year, making food at least seem more affordable to buy and sell. To this end, The Kraft Heinz Company's 2024 revenue-growth guidance of between nil and 2% still holds water, as does its comparable outlook for profit growth. After that, the organization can really begin flexing its brands' marketing muscles again."", 'Or, think about Buffett\'s sage advice to ""buy unpopular stocks"" while they\'re unpopular. Said another way (again in Buffett\'s words), ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" There\'s certainly plenty of fear surrounding Kraft Heinz stock right now.', ""Whatever your motivation is, newcomers will be stepping into this stock while the dividend yield's a healthy 4.4%. That's based on a dividend payment, by the way, that's still more than easily covered by real, actual earnings."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

On the company’s first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said McDonald’s had to be “laser-focused on affordability” given how price-weary diners have become. The company’s results were weaker than expected.', '“What we don’t have in the US right now is a national value platform,” Kempczinski said, prompting questions from analysts about what such an offer might entail.', 'McDonald’s shares rose as much as 2.7%, the most since January 2023, in New York trading Friday after Bloomberg’s initial report of the meal-deal effort. Wendy’s Co. fell as much as 3.7%, and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. slid 1.3%.', 'At McDonald’s, franchisees pay into an advertising fund and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns, including promotions such as the viral Grimace Shake. A prior attempt to get operators — who run about 95% of US stores — to endorse the $5 meal initiative failed earlier this year, the person said.', 'Some operators were concerned about losing money on the roughly four-week promotion, particularly in states such as California, where the minimum wage for fast-food workers jumped 25% to $20 an hour earlier this year. McDonald’s has said that franchisee cash flows are up about 50% since 2018 and are still on the rise, though an independent group representing operators has raised concerns about the cost of labor and investments to freshen up stores.', 'To sweeten the deal, McDonald’s enlisted money from Coca-Cola Co. that could help cushion a potential profitability hit for franchisees, the person familiar said. The size of the beverage company’s contribution hasn’t been decided, and the burger chain wasn’t expected to put up funds. Coca-Cola, which often contributes to customers’ marketing programs, declined to comment.', 'McDonald’s declined to elaborate beyond Kempczinski’s prior comments. John Palmaccio, the chairman of the operators’ advertising fund, said in a statement to Bloomberg News that the company, franchisees and suppliers are coming together to deliver “great value and affordability” now that “our customers really need it.”', 'Catching Up', 'After years of solid sales and traffic results, McDonald’s is now grappling with a pullback from low-income consumers, who account for a substantial portion of its clientele.', 'Kempczinski bemoaned in the most recent earnings call that the company was offering local deals and bundles rather than national promotions, as some competitors do. Burger King, for example, has a limited-time $5 duo, and Wendy’s a two-for-$3 breakfast deal.', '“McDonald’s has had such strong sales in recent years that they didn’t really need it,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research, which focuses on restaurants. “Now that the consumer has shown by action that they’re demanding value more than they were even six months ago, McDonald’s is changing with the times.”', 'Earlier this year, the independent franchisee group urged the company to bring back the discontinued snack wraps, arguing they’re “craveable, relatively simple to produce” and could “easily satisfy the call for more affordable options on the menu.” The organization cautioned against discounting the chain’s “iconic” menu items and nudged the company to expand its beverage lineup.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculation is not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Hasbro HAS, Brinker International EAT, DaVita DVA, Leidos Holdings LDOS and Allstate ALL are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”', 'Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.', 'This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.', 'It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.', 'This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.', 'The lower, the better.', 'This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.', 'This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.', 'No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.', ""The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our five picks out of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen:Hasbro is engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys. The company is expected to benefit from its dedicated efforts to broaden its product range, optimize inventory management and capitalize on robust demand within the gaming sector. These strategic initiatives, coupled with the pursuit of an out-licensing strategy for select brands, are anticipated to bolster structural profitability in the near term. A heightened emphasis on implementing a more adaptable strategy, coupled with a marketing budget aimed at refining consumer targeting and amplifying its impact, is likely to play a pivotal role in bolstering the company's performance in the near term and resetting its cost structure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HAS’ 2024 earnings has moved north by 11.4% to $3.61 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same twice, the average surprise being 17.45%.Brinker International owns, operates, develops and franchises various restaurants under Chili’s Grill & Bar (Chili’s) and Maggiano’s Little Italy (Maggiano’s) brands. Chili’s is a preeminent leader in the bar & grill category of casual dining. The brand has been functioning for over 40 years.Brinker remains steadfast in its goal to drive traffic and revenues through a range of sales-building initiatives, such as streamlining of menu and its innovation, strengthening its value proposition, better food presentation, advertising campaigns, kitchen system optimization and introduction of better service platform.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EAT’s fiscal 2024 earnings has moved north by 5.7% to $3.91 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 213.35%.DaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The company has been expanding its global presence via its Integrated Kidney Care business. DVA has been opening and acquiring several dialysis centers both within the United States and overseas, which is promising. Per management, after years of investment and consistent year-over-year improvements in cost savings, DaVita’s Medicare Advantage contracts and Special Need Plans have now reached profitability. The strong solvency position of DVA is an added plus.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DVA’s 2024 earnings has increased by 2.8% to $9.49 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 29.35%.Leidos Holdings is a global science and technology leader that serves the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. Its core capabilities include providing solutions in the fields of cybersecurity, data analytics, enterprise IT modernization, operations and logistics, sensors, collection and phenomenology, software development, and systems engineering. Organic growth due to increased sales volume from programs like hypersonics and the Sentinel, along with positive synergies from the Cobham Special Mission acquisition, is likely to aid Defense Solution’s revenues in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LDOS’ 2024 earnings has moved north by 7.9% to $8.37 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 23.43%.Allstate is the third-largest property-casualty (P&C) insurer and the largest publicly-held personal lines carrier in the United States. The company’s focus on keeping up with elevated loss cost trends is commendable, given it has been pursuing rate hikes consistently to earn profits in its Auto and Homeowners business. The auto insurance business is expected to be driven by expanding earned premiums and reduced adverse non-catastrophe prior-year reserve re-estimates in the near term. Meanwhile, the homeowners’ insurance business is likely to receive a boost from improved average gross premium per policy in Allstate and National General brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALL’s 2024 earnings has improved by 8.9% to $14.82 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 41.88%.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

(AP) — A cyberattack on the Ascension health system operating in 19 states across the U.S. forced some of its 140 hospitals to divert ambulances, caused patients to postpone medical tests and blocked online access to patient records.', 'An Ascension spokesperson said it detected “unusual activity” Wednesday on its computer network systems. Officials refused to say whether the non-profit Catholic health system, based in St. Louis, was the victim of a ransomware attack or whether it had paid a ransom, and it did not immediately respond to an email seeking updates.', 'But the attack had the hallmarks of a ransomware, and Ascension said it had called in Mandiant, the Google cybersecurity unit that is a leading responder to such attacks. Earlier this year, a cyberattack on Change Healthcare disrupted care systems nationwide, and the CEO of its parent, UnitedHealth Group Inc., acknowledged in testimony to Congress that it had paid a ransom of $22 million in bitcoin.', 'Ascension said that both its electronic records system and the MyChart system that gives patients access to their records and allows them to communicate with their doctors were offline.', '“We have determined this is a cybersecurity incident,” the national Ascension spokesperson’s statement said. “Our investigation and restoration work will take time to complete, and we do not have a timeline for completion.”', 'To prevent the automated spread of ransomware, hospital IT officials typically take electronic medical records and appointment-scheduling systems offline. UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty told congressional committees that Change Healthcare immediately disconnected from other systems to prevent the attack from spreading during its incident.', ""The Ascension spokesperson's latest statement, issued Thursday, said ambulances had been diverted from “several” hospitals without naming them."", ""In Wichita, Kansas, local news reports said the local emergency medical services started diverting all ambulance calls from its hospitals there Wednesday, though the health system's spokesperson there said Friday that the full diversion of ambulances ended Thursday afternoon."", 'The EMS service for Pensacola, Florida, also diverted patients from the Ascension hospital there to other hospitals, its spokesperson told the Pensacola News Journal.', ""And WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee reported that Ascension patients in the area said they were missing CT scans and mammograms and couldn't refill prescriptions."", 'Connie Smith, president of the Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, is among the Ascension providers turning to paper records this week to cope. Smith, who coordinates surgeries at Ascension St. Francis Hospital in Milwaukee, said the hospital didn’t cancel any surgical procedures and continued treating emergency patients.', 'But she said everything has slowed down because electronic systems are built into the hospital’s daily operations. Younger providers are often unfamiliar with paper copies of essential records and it takes more time to document patient care, check the results of prior lab tests and verify information with doctors’ offices, she said.', 'Smith said union leaders feel staff and service cutbacks have made the situation even tougher. Hospital staff also have received little information about what led to the attack or when operations might get closer to normal, she said.', '“You’re doing everything to the best of your ability but you leave feeling frustrated because you know you could have done things faster or gotten that patient home sooner if you just had some extra hands,” Smith said.', 'Ascension said its system expected to use “downtime” procedures “for some time” and advised patients to bring notes on their symptoms and a list of prescription numbers or prescription bottles with them to appointments.', 'Cybersecurity experts say ransomware attacks have increased substantially in recent years, especially in the health care sector. Increasingly, ransomware gangs steal data before activating data-scrambling malware that paralyzes networks. The threat of making stolen data public is used to extort payments. That data can also be sold online.', ""“We are working around the clock with internal and external advisors to investigate, contain, and restore our systems,” the Ascension spokesperson's latest statement said."", 'The attack against Change Healthcare earlier this year delayed insurance reimbursements and heaped stress on doctor’s offices around the country. Change Healthcare provides technology used by doctor offices and other care providers to submit and process billions of insurance claims a year.', 'It was unclear Friday whether the same group was responsible for both attacks.', ""Witty said Change Healthcare's core systems were now fully functional. But company officials have said it may take several months of analysis to identify and notify those who were affected by the attack."", 'They also have said they see no signs that doctor charts or full medical histories were released after the attack.
