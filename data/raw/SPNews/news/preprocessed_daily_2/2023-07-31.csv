If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring rich and the most expensive places to retire to, you may go to 5 Expensive Places to Retire That Are Worth It.When it comes to wealthiest cities in the world, New York emerges at the top with over 340,000 millionaires. Tokyo, and of course San Francisco’s Bay Area follow the lead, with 290,300 and 285,000 millionaires respectively. But do these millionaires prefer these cities for retirement, or do they have second-homes elsewhere? Read on to find out.Retiring RichRetirement is a multifaceted term carrying diverse connotations for retirees. For those without substantial savings, downgrading lifestyles and relying on social security is largely what reaps retirement. Such individuals, or even those with moderate nest eggs, end up facing the decision of rejoining the workforce, or worse, emulating the paths of their less fortunate counterparts. Conversely, the affluent tend to embrace a more autonomous working lifestyle in this period, instead of completely relinquishing their professional pursuits.For such affluent retirees, money still comes from investments, businesses built, and ventures started. They pay taxes and build on their wealth while enjoying a slower pace of life. However, CNBC notes that becoming such a high-net-worth individual may seem farfetched for 74% of US adults. The impossible dream takes more than making a good salary or diverse income streams. In fact, CNBC reveals that retirement investing plays a significant role in the portfolios of the elite.Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are few financial institutions offering individuals with retirement accounts for their golden years. Many high-net-worth individuals have contributed as much as 55% of their wealth through such retirement accounts. Michelle Brownstein, a certified financial planner and vice president of Empower Private Client Group working with high-net-worth clients, reveals thatStory continues""The strategies needed to get rich are different from the ones required to stay rich and eventually earn on your money"".Therefore, a diversified investment portfolio can go a long way in expanding wealth. Maxing out your retirement account can also help your money grow through the magic of compound interest. For those who are employers themselves, companies such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) offer traditional and Roth IRAs to allow you and your employees to start saving.Expensive Places to Retire toA complex question every potential retiree faces when nearing retirement is where they should be retiring to. Many affordable options have been popping up over the years, from the sunny state of Florida to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. The average retiree finds affordable options to help make the most of their retirement income.However, not everyone tends to think this way. For the rich retirees, the top priority isn't affordability; it's luxury. Due to this reason, this time, we've been rounding up on the most expensive cities to retire to, such as New York, Paris, Nice, and Monaco City, to see which ones classify as the best places for the affluent to retire to.Not only are these some of the best places to retire if you’re rich, but also the best options for retirees to socialize with like-minded individuals. For those who wish to stay in the States, Ney York's Big Apple, New York City, is home to the most number of millionaires in the world. This fact grants it the title of the wealthiest city in the world, according to a report by Henley &amp; Partners.CNBC has also crowned New York as the most expensive state to retire in, followed by New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Maryland. California is also an expensive state to live in. Wealthy individuals love to retire to such places, offering them the best of shopping, dining, and other form of leisure. There are many expensive retirement communities for the wealthy in other parts of the states too, such as Promontory Club in Utah, White Sands at La Jolla, La Jolla, California, and The Clare in Chicago.Wherever you choose to retire, you must start saving immediately and have enough savings in your retirement accounts. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) not only offer retirement accounts but also offer a range of resources to help you maximize your retirement savings.20 Expensive Places to Retire That Are Worth ItJCStudio/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo compile the list of expensive places to retire that are worth it, we began by checking out the most expensive countries in the world.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

3,7472da01-9516-3bee-aea3-0474022edaf8,AYI,2023-07-31,Here's What To Make Of Acuity Brands' (NYSE:AYI) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-acuity-brands-nyse-ayi-124956235.html,1690721396,STORY,['AYI'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Acuity Brands' (NYSE:AYI) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Acuity Brands, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$520m ÷ (US$3.4b - US$624m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).So, Acuity Brands has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Electrical industry. See our latest analysis for Acuity Brands roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Acuity Brands compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Acuity Brands.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 27% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Acuity Brands' ROCEIn the end, Acuity Brands has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 24% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Acuity Brands   you'll probably want to know about.While Acuity Brands may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.1. Futures edge higherU.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, S&amp;P futures added 4 points or 0.08%, and Nasdaq 100 futures moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has added 3.8%.As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.2. Amazon and Apple results aheadE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.Story continuesApple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI).

U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendarHiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.Economists predict that total nonfarm employment rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the jobless rate is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FTThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) cease trading in all digital tokens except for Bitcoin prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist crypto assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJRetail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has further cemented its interest in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.The moves boost Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers.Related ArticlesAmazon and Apple earnings ahead, U.S. jobs report looms -- what's moving marketsAnalysis-Dwindling excess savings could scupper markets' soft-landing hopesCanada's Trudeau sets sights on fourth election fight with Cabinet refresh]"

He said it is better to produce oil and natural gas at home rather than rely on foreign leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine sent global energy prices soaring around the globe.“We have all witnessed how Putin has manipulated and weaponized energy — disrupting supply and stalling growth in countries around the world,’’ Sunak said in a statement. “Now more than ever, it’s vital that we bolster our energy security and capitalize on that independence to deliver more affordable, clean energy to British homes and businesses.’’The plan comes as Sunak faces pressure to roll back expensive environmental commitments as his Conservative Party scrambles to attract voters amid opinion polls showing that the party is likely headed toward a crushing defeat in the next general election.But U.N. scientists and environmental campaigners are calling on governments around the world to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels after a summer of record high temperatures, drought and floods linked to man-made climate change. Burning oil and gas to power vehicles, factories and electricity generating stations releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the main driver of global warming.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has raised concerns that governments were backtracking on their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions at a time when they should accelerate their efforts.Story continues“The problem is not simply fossil fuel emissions, it’s fossil fuels — period,” Guterres told reporters last month in New York.“The solution is clear: The world must phase out fossil fuels in a just and equitable way — moving to leave oil, coal and gas in the ground where they belong — and massively boosting renewable investment in a just transition.”Britain began pumping oil and gas from the North Sea in the mid-1970s, a major source of jobs and tax revenue, particularly in Scotland. But production has been declining since around 2000, making support for the industry a major political issue.British authorities have pledged to reduce net carbon emissions by 68% by the end of the decade, on the way to reaching net-zero by 2050. Achieving net-zero means releasing only as much greenhouse gasses as can be pulled out of the atmosphere through natural or technological means.But the government's climate advisers say the pace of progress is “worryingly slow.” In a report last month, an advisory panel that tracks the U.K.'s decarbonization efforts slammed officials for backtracking on commitments and said Britain had “lost its clear global leadership position on climate action.”The Climate Change Committee said backing for a new coal mine and new domestic oil and gas production undermined Britain’s “international messaging” on the need to stop developing fossil fuel projects.The carbon capture and storage projects backed by Sunak aim to remove carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and pump it into old gas fields for permanent storage underground.Environmental campaigners say the risk of focusing on this technology is that it may distract the government from other programs needed to accelerate the drive to net-zero, and deceive consumers into thinking that continued use of fossil fuels is compatible with such a goal.“It's a bit difficult to take seriously the idea that this should be prioritized for prime ministerial attention when so much else needs it instead,'' Doug Parr, the chief scientific officer for Greenpeace UK, told the BBC.Stuart Haszeldine, a professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, said Sunak's cash injection could be “transformative'' in expanding carbon capture and storage, but there is reason to be skeptical about the motives of the energy industry, which has traditionally been more focused on making money for shareholders than pursuing environmental targets.“Unless the governments make carbon capture and storage profitable, oil companies tend not to be very interested,'' Haszeldine told the BBC. “Their money can talk very loudly, but it doesn’t listen very well.""""What governments are often subjected to is intense lobbying by oil and gas companies to continue extracting oil and gas and to go slow on carbon capture and storage,” he added.]"

(NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.39 per share on the 1st of September. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 4.0%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before this announcement, FirstEnergy was paying out 217% of what it was earning, and not generating any free cash flows either. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 52%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.56. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.4% a year during that period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.FirstEnergy Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. FirstEnergy has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Strong earnings is nice to see, but unless this can be sustained on minimal reinvestment of profits, we would question whether dividends will follow suit.FirstEnergy's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about FirstEnergy's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While we generally think the level of distributions are a bit high, we wouldn't rule it out as becoming a good dividend payer in the future as its earnings are growing healthily. We don't think FirstEnergy is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

It said it was aiming to make a final decision on the deal by Aug. 29.The public consultation raises the chance that the biggest gaming deal in history could go ahead, with the deadline for completion having been extended by the parties to Oct. 18.Story continuesThe Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in London, which was set to examine the CMA's decision to block the deal, has already published Microsoft's argument that the binding commitments accepted by the European Commission shortly after Britain blocked the deal had changed the situation.Microsoft's appeal at the CAT was put on hold earlier this month to give the parties more time to resolve the dispute.The CMA was left increasingly isolated in its opposition after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission struggled in its attempts to block the deal.Microsoft said in its arguments published on Monday that evidence that emerged in the U.S. bolstered its case on market definition in relation to cloud gaming.(Reporting by Sarah Young, Sam Tobin and Paul Sandle; Editing by Kate Holton, Barbara Lewis, Christina Fincher and Sharon Singleton)]"

This means the annual payment is 6.4% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Despite not generating a profit, Walgreens Boots Alliance is still paying a dividend. Along with this, it is also not generating free cash flows, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the dividend.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 21%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendWalgreens Boots Alliance Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.10, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.7% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Earnings per share has been sinking by 28% over the last five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Walgreens Boots Alliance is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

33,417c7594-d7b3-3592-a2b0-06ab828f5aed,PAYX,2023-07-31,"Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 74%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-inc-nasdaq-payx-favorite-123347593.html,1690720427,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Paychex's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 14 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Paychex. See our latest analysis for Paychex ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Paychex?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Paychex already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Paychex's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Paychex is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Paychex's case, its Top Key Executive, B. Golisano, is the largest shareholder, holding 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.6%.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PaychexThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Paychex, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$46b, and insiders have US$4.9b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

34,69ad2d07-4dd3-37ef-92b2-535c2df13284,SBUX,2023-07-31,Copart and Cal-Maine Foods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copart-cal-maine-foods-highlighted-095000518.html,1690797000,STORY,"['CPRT', 'CALM', 'SBUX', 'ARHS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 31, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Copart CPRT as the Bull of the Day and Cal-Maine Foods CALM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Starbucks Corp. SBUX, Arhaus ARHS and Costco COST.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Copart, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), enjoys a dominant leadership position in the automotive auction market, commanding a roughly 40% market share. A set of bullish initiatives including new facility openings, elevated salvage auction volumes, and an industry-leading digital offering in Copart Max have helped the stock resume its long-term upward trajectory. CPRT stock hit an all-time high earlier this month as stocks have entered a new bull market. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.CPRT sports the second-highest Zacks Growth Style Score of 'B', indicating further upside is likely based on favorable earnings and sales growth metrics. The company is part of the Zacks Auction and Valuation Services industry group, which ranks in the top 1% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. It's not a coincidence that this group has been steadily outperforming this year.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionCopart is a global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services. The company enables the processing and selling of vehicles over the internet through its virtual bidding, auction-style sales technology to vehicle sellers, insurance companies, banks, charities, dealers, and vehicle rental companies.Story continuesCopart's range of services includes online seller access, salvage estimation, end-of-life vehicle processing, transportation, vehicle inspection, title processing and procurement, flexible payment options, and dealer programs.The company also enables the selling of vehicles through CashForCars.com; Copart Recycling service, which allows the public to purchase parts from salvaged vehicles; and Copart 360, an online technology platform for posting vehicle images. Copart sells its products to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers, as well as to the public.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates CPRT has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in May, the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $0.72/share, a 16.13% surprise over the $0.62 consensus estimate. CPRT has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.61%.The Dallas, TX-based company primarily has two revenue streams: service revenue and purchased vehicles. Both earnings and revenues have grown steadily despite previous economic headwinds.For the current fiscal year, analysts have increased earnings estimates by 3.36% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $2.46/share, reflecting potential growth of 10.31% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 9.17% to $3.82 billion.Let's Get TechnicalCPRT shares have advanced nearly 46% in the past year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, CPRT is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Copart has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and CPRT continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.Bottom LineSolid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. CPRT enjoys a dominant market position, along with a strong balance sheet and high liquidity. Increasing volume at recent breakout levels is another bullish sign for the stock.Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Investors would be wise to consider CPRT as a portfolio candidate.Bear of the Day:Cal-Maine Foods produces, packages, and distributes shell eggs. The company offers specialty shell eggs such as nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic, and brown eggs under recognized brand names including Egg-Land's Best, Land O' Lakes, Farmhouse Eggs, and 4-Grain. CALM markets and sells its products to national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, independent supermarkets, and foodservice distributors. Cal-Maine Foods was founded in 1957 and is based in Ridgeland, MS.The Zacks RundownCALM, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Agriculture – Products industry group, which ranks in the bottom 10% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has throughout this year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.The odds are stacked against CALM, and the stock is agreeing with this notion. CALM shares experienced a climax top in December of last year and have been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the stock continues to lag the major market indexes.Deteriorating Outlook Cal-Maine Foods has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current quarter (fiscal Q1), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate sits at a loss of -$0.01/share, reflecting a -100.39% decline relative to the same quarter last year.For the current fiscal year, analysts have also revised their EPS estimates downward by 13.93% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $4.20/share, translating to negative growth of -72.94%. Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical TrendAs illustrated below, CALM stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The 50-day moving average has recently acted as resistance and shares are currently testing that level. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, CALM stock has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross', wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CALM would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 10% this year alone, widely underperforming the major indices.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that CALM is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. Falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of CALM shares until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:What's In Store for Starbucks (SBUX) Earnings?Starbucks Corp. is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.

In the same quarter a year ago, the retail coffee chain posted per-share profit of 84 cents on sales of $8.2 billion. In its most recent quarter, Starbucks enjoyed stronger-than-expected sales as demand in China began to recover.ONLINE RETAIL BELLWEATHERAmazon issues its second-quarter earnings report after the bell on Thursday.Wall Street is expecting the e-commerce giant to post profit of 35 cents per share on $131.4 billion in sales for the quarter. In the same period a year ago, Seattle-based Amazon lost $2 billion, or 20 cents per share, in the three-month period ended June 30. That loss was driven by a $3.9 billion write-down of the value of its investment in electric vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) stock is up an impressive 129% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 23% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Parker-Hannifin managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.3% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 18% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Parker-Hannifin's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Parker-Hannifin's TSR for the last 5 years was 150%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Parker-Hannifin has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 42% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 20% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Oversold Dividend Stocks to Invest In. Dividend investing stands as a highly significant investment strategy for generating reliable and stable cash flow. Over the years, dividend stocks demonstrated their ability to outperform the broader market on several occasions. This makes them an attractive choice for investors seeking both income and potential long-term growth. Moreover, dividend stocks have represented a significant portion of overall market returns. We also reported Hartford Fund’s data which revealed that dividends have accounted for approximately 41% of the index's total return on average from 1930 to 2022.Though investors favored tech growth stocks in early 2023, analysts believe that dividend stocks may make a comeback due to the potential for a mild recession. On July 18, Bank of America released a global fund manager survey indicating that sentiment has turned more bearish. The majority consensus is now leaning towards a mild recession in the last quarter of 2023. The main concerns cited by respondents include potential risks related to inflation, policy mistakes, and a credit crunch. To navigate this bearish sentiment, analysts advise adding dividend-paying stocks to portfolios as these stocks historically perform better during economic downturns compared to non-dividend ones.Dividend stocks are not completely recession-proof, but they tend to be more stable compared to high-growth or speculative stocks when the economy is going through a downturn. Last year’s bear market also showed a strong outperformance of dividend stocks in comparison with other asset classes. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index declined by 6.47% in 2022, whereas the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst performance since 2008, falling by over 19%. Investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their dividends for long periods of time rather than those with high yields. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their continuous commitment to shareholders for decades.Story continuesAlso read: 11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyWhen speaking about economic downturns, these periods can negatively impact investor confidence, leading to widespread selling across various stocks and causing some to become oversold.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's press release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.Sam Hazen: Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The company produced solid earnings in the second quarter. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins. Across most areas of our business, we maintain the operational momentum that we experienced over the past 3 quarters. We believe this strength should continue into the second half of the year. Accordingly, we updated our earnings guidance for 2023 to reflect this outlook. Against the difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2022, diluted earnings per share increased to $4.29. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong. Admissions grew 2.2% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries increased 1.8%, same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.7%.Story continuesThis growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.7% and outpatient surgeries which grew 3.3%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, with increased 5%. The growth in volumes was broad-based across the company's divisions and diversified within most service lines. Additionally, volumes were supported by strong acuity growth of 1.6% and a favorable payer mix from commercial adjusted admissions growth of 5%. These factors drove an increase in same facility revenue of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we continued to invest in our people, and as a result, we saw improvements across virtually all key labor metrics. Turnover continued to decline for nurses and trended at an annualized rate of 17%.Nurse hiring remained strong in the quarter and for the year has increased by 9% as compared to last year. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 20% compared to the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we improved available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined and represented 0.8% of total admissions, down from 1.5% in the first quarter. We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide even higher quality care to our patients. As we look to the future, we remain encouraged by both the backdrop of strong demand that we expect in our markets and our overall competitive positioning within them.Africa Studio/Shutterstock.comHCA Healthcare will continue to use its disciplined operating culture to execute our strategic and capital allocation plans. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and their overall effectiveness. So let me close with this. I want to speak to a recent event that we take very seriously. On July 10, we announced that we had recently discovered a list of certain information with respect to some of our patients was made available by an unknown and unauthorized party on an online forum. We have confirmed that the list does not include clinical information, payment information or other sensitive information like passwords, driver's license or social security numbers. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, but this event appears to be a theft from an external storage location that was exclusively used to format e-mail messages.We are in the process of notifying all affected patients in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. And not unexpectedly, we have been named as a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits. This incident has not caused any disruption to our day-to-day operations nor do we believe it will materially impact our business or financial results. HCA Healthcare believes the privacy of its patients is a vital part of its mission and remains committed to maintaining the security of their personal information. With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results.Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 7% to $15.86 billion from $14.82 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4% growth in equivalent admissions and 2.9% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in the Valesco joint venture and we are now consolidating the operations of this venture. This reduced our consolidated margins approximately 30 basis points in the quarter.We believe this transaction not only mitigates business risk with the Envision bankruptcy proceedings but will also further support alignment between our hospital-based physicians and our hospital care teams on improving quality, patient satisfaction and efficiencies. When you consider this transaction and the $145 million payer settlement we recognized last quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margins have remained consistent between the first and second quarters. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $845 million in the quarter from $1.63 billion in the prior year to $2.475 billion this year. Capital spending was just over $1.2 billion.We paid $164 million in dividends and repurchased $915 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $63.25 billion and $64.75 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.9 billion and $5.255 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.70 and $18.90, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion during the year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&amp;A.Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill.

58,6b6361cd-d3fa-3be3-89ea-3a07e7dd8f9b,TSN,2023-07-31,The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Protect Your Portfolio From Global Chaos,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-dividend-stocks-protect-235456165.html,1690242896,STORY,"['CVX', 'NVS', 'TSN', 'ABBV', 'BTG', 'PKE']","[Although the best dividend stocks for portfolio protection might come off as a rather boring endeavor, at the present juncture, there may be no more relevant idea for investors. Frankly, with the world seemingly poised for a massive conflict, market participants may want to seek the relative stability of dividend investing in proven enterprises.First off, Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine shows zero sign of ending anytime soon. Sure, less-than-good-faith arguments exist about Western forces not fueling the conflict. However, the Russian government-backed itself into a corner because the free world cannot allow the normalization of brazen military conquests. And that’s because of China.Let’s face reality. China has long claimed Taiwan as its rightful territory, issuing strong rhetoric to undergird its claims. For now, China and Western allies play diplomatic circus acts over the issue. However, the normalization of military conquests could give the Chinese government bad ideas. Cynically, such a framework only heightens the case for global chaos-resistant stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAtop of all this, you have a global food crisis along with brewing tensions over critical resources. Put another way, it’s time to consider the top dividend stocks for protection.Best Dividend Stocks: Novartis (NVS)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA Swiss multinational pharmaceutical firm, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) organically makes a strong case for top dividend stocks for portfolio protection. After all, when you need medical care, you just need it, irrespective of economic conditions. Therefore, it’s not terribly surprising that NVS gained almost 14% since the beginning of this year.At the same time, Novartis benefits from its therapeutic specialty in addressing obesity. The company enjoys a strong acumen in the field. As well, the company’s MBL-949 is currently undergoing Phase II studies for the underlying obesity indication. Cynically, because the condition represents a growing health concern in the U.S. and other parts of the world, NVS ranks among the insulated ideas for global chaos-resistant stocks.Story continuesFor passive income, Novartis commands a forward yield of 3.33%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Moreover, the payout ratio sits at 46.49%, easing concerns about yield sustainability.Best Dividend Stocks: Park Aerospace (PKE)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text. discounted dividend stocksSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAn intriguing but risky idea for the best dividend stocks, Park Aerospace (NYSE:PKE) provides a solid balance between passive income and capital gains potential. A materials manufacturer, Park Aerospace provides solutions for various industries, including telecommunications, internet infrastructure, and high-end computing. Of course, it specializes in the aerospace field, presenting very attractive upside opportunities.On a less-controversial note, Park Aerospace features strong implications for the burgeoning space economy given its advanced composite materials specialty. On a more controversial note, the company also plays into defense/military needs. As explained earlier, geopolitical tensions and outright flashpoints are worsening. And they may continue to worsen without strong moral resolve, which may benefit PKE as one of the best dividend stocks.Speaking of which, Park Aerospace carries a forward yield of 3.44%, above the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Combined with the enterprise’s consistent profitability and strong balance sheet, PKE ranks among the top ideas for dividend investing.Best Dividend Stocks: Tyson Foods (TSN)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAs a major operator in the food industry, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) easily makes a case for the best dividend stocks for portfolio protection. No matter what happens in the economy or in global affairs, people must eat. And if we’re going to at least acknowledge the cynical realm of this subject, geopolitical flashpoints represent a powerful catalyst for TSN and its ilk.Basically, the world is rushing toward a framework of limited resources for a rising global populace. Logically, such a condition engenders conflict and in turn will raise prices for critical goods. Fortuitously, then, the backdrop may cover up many ills for Tyson Foods. Yes, TSN is down 17% for the year. And in the past 365 days, it lost 37% of its equity value. Still, outside factors bolster its relevance.As for passive income, Tyson carries a forward yield of 3.65%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. In addition, the company’s payout ratio is somewhat elevated but still reasonable at 56.64%. Lastly, it sports 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, making TSN worth consideration.Chevron (CVX)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA hydrocarbon energy giant, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might not seem like one of the best dividend stocks for portfolio protection based on the intense focus on green energy solutions. With political and ideological forces stressing the importance of building renewable infrastructures, Chevron seems rather anachronistic. The market seemingly agrees, sending CVX down nearly 9% since the January opener.Still, on a fundamental note, Chevron deserves consideration from those interested in dividend investing. Given the high energy density of fossil fuels, it’s unlikely that the hydrocarbon sector will simply go away. Also, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are intermittent. Therefore, oil and gas plays will likely be relevant for years to come as they offer diversification among other attributes.For passive income, Chevron sports a forward yield of 3.81%. In fairness, this stat rates a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24.%. However, CVX’s payout ratio sits at 43.74%, offering confidence regarding yield sustainability. Plus, it enjoys 37 years of consecutive dividend increases.AbbVie (ABBV)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAnother pharmaceutical idea for best dividend stocks, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) benefits from reliable relevance. Again, if patients find themselves in need of medical help, they’ll seek it irrespective of economic or market conditions. Further, I appreciate AbbVie specifically because of its Allergan acquisition, which subsequently brought Botox under the acquirer’s control.First, social normalization trends suggest that people will be interacting with each other in person. Naturally, this framework should bolster Botox sales. Second, as millennials and eventually members of Generation Z become older, their vanity offers a viable backdrop for enhanced sales. As a bonus, ABBV trades at forward earnings multiple of 12.48, lower than 68.5% of the competition.Moving onto passive income, AbbVie commands a forward yield of 4.12%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 4.12%. With a payout ratio of 53.41%, investors seeking dividend stocks for portfolio protection have reasonable sustainability assurances. Lastly, the company enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases.B2Gold (BTG)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile I could have gone with a more conservative idea for best dividend stocks in the precious metals arena, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) offers a tantalizing mix of upside return potential and passive income. Fundamentally, gold-related ideas offer a hedge against market uncertainty, making them an idea against global chaos.Interestingly, though, BTG hasn’t performed that well in the chart. Since the beginning of this year, BTG slipped almost 2%. However, in the trailing 365 days, shares gained nearly 12% of equity value. With their value steadily printing a series of higher lows, investors may be looking at a burgeoning opportunity.Also, it’s worth pointing out that BTG trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.48x. In contrast, the sector median stat comes in at 0.84X. Therefore, market participants seeking dividend investing ideas can pick up an attractive discount. Finally, B2Gold carries a forward yield of 4.43%, well above the material sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, its payout ratio is reasonable at 53%.IBM (IBM)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile technology firms might not rank among the best dividend stocks amid global chaos, IBM (NYSE:IBM) may be the exception. As a legacy tech provider, “Big Blue” carries a reputation for being boring. I can see why that is but in recent years, the company has ramped up its relevance, particularly with its hybrid cloud solutions.Moving forward, IBM also offers viable solutions in the field of enterprise-level cybersecurity. If we’re going to talk about global chaos resistant stocks, we can’t ignore rising cybercrimes and online network vulnerabilities. State-sponsored nefarious actors can easily wreak havoc, which is why cybersecurity has never been more important.To be sure, banking on IBM stock may not be the path to meme-like riches. However, for the patient investor, it can be a worthwhile asset. Featuring a forward yield of 4.78%, IBM soars above the tech sector’s average yield of only 1.37%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best August Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the stock market, various strategies may gain popularity at different times, but investors consistently gravitate toward dividend stocks due to their ability to generate regular cash. As of the beginning of 2023, there has been a resurgence in the popularity and performance of tech stocks, while dividend stocks have been trailing behind in terms of investor interest and returns.Overall, the S&amp;P 500 experienced sluggish growth in dividend payments during the second quarter of 2023. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, 460 companies increased their dividends in Q2 2023, down 17.1% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that total dividend increases were $9.80 billion during this period, compared with $19.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsThe ongoing concerns over inflation and fears of a potential recession have prompted investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks. Historically, dividends have shown strong performance during economic downturns, making them more appealing among income investors. We recently reported Refinitiv Lipper’s data which highlighted that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received a significant boost with $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This surge represents the highest two-week increase for the ETF since January.To increase their cash flow, investors often prioritize companies with a history of strong dividend growth. By investing in such firms, investors can potentially benefit from both regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. According to a report by iShares, dividend growers outperformed dividend cutters and eliminators during both bull and bear markets from 1978 to 2021. These equities also recorded an overall strong performance than non-dividend payers during this period. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best dividend stocks to consider that have increased their dividends for decades.Story continuesDividend Capture Strategy:Within the broad category of dividend investing, various related strategies exist to help investors generate wealth. The dividend capture strategy is one of the known investment approaches where investors aim to profit from capturing dividend payments of specific stocks. The goal is to buy the stock just before the ex-dividend date, hold it long enough to receive the dividend, and then promptly sell it. By repeatedly executing this process with different dividend-paying stocks, investors can generate a stream of income from dividends.10 Best August Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list features the dividend capture strategy for selecting notable dividend stocks set to trade ex-dividend in August 2023.

Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street Analysts.Last week was marked by significant central bank decisions, leading to increased volatility in the markets. Global central banks are now shifting their policies to be more data-dependent when it comes to rate adjustments. Surprises from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have disrupted expectations and caused notable currency movements. Traders are bracing for more volatility in the coming days as they grapple with the implications of the recent central bank actions. The US dollar, euro, and yen are particularly in focus on Monday as investors try to determine if the Federal Reserve and ECB's rate hikes signal the end of their tightening cycles. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's shift towards a looser grip on bond yields adds further complexity to the global monetary policy landscape. These developments have left investors uncertain about the future trajectory of interest rates and their potential impact on the financial markets.Oil prices slightly decreased on July 31 but remained close to three-month highs, heading towards the biggest monthly gains in over a year, reported Reuters. The market anticipates that Saudi Arabia will continue its voluntary output cuts into September, contributing to a tightening of global supply. Brent crude futures were down 30 cents at $84.69 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude stood at $80.36 a barrel, down 22 cents. Both Brent and WTI settled on July 28 at their highest levels since April, rising for the fifth consecutive week, supported by tightening oil supplies worldwide and expectations of an end to U.S. interest rate hikes. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce the extension of its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month including September at the OPEC+ meeting on August 4. Global oil demand reached a record 102.8 million bpd in July, according to Goldman Sachs, which revised up its 2023 demand estimates for India and the U.S. due to stronger economic growth projections, offsetting a downgrade for China's consumption. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods predicts record oil demand for this year and the next, potentially boosting energy prices in the latter half of the year. In the U.S., the number of oil rigs decreased for the eighth consecutive month in July, with energy firms cutting one rig to reach 529 rigs, according to Baker Hughes' weekly report on July 28.Story continuesOn the Asian side, the ASEAN nations are collaborating on a cross-border payment system with the aim of promoting financial inclusivity across the region, reported CNBC. Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have implemented a system that allows residents in these countries to pay for goods and services using their local currencies. This move is anticipated to have several positive impacts, including boosting tourism, increasing consumer spending, and facilitating remittance flows between the nations. Experts predict that the implementation of the cross-border payments system will be particularly advantageous for micro-enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, and the unbanked population. On the Chinese front, China's factory activity continued to contract for the fourth consecutive month in July, and non-manufacturing activity also slowed to its weakest level this year. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for July was 49.3, slightly better than the forecast of 49.2 but still below the 50-point level that indicates expansion. Similarly, the official non-manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5 in July, showing a slowdown in activity compared to previous months. China's struggles to revive growth momentum are evident due to soft global demand and insufficient domestic demand. Enterprises reported challenges in the current external environment, with decreased overseas orders and insufficient demand as their main difficulties. These readings point to a challenging economic recovery in China, as top leaders describe it as ""tortuous."" The situation is attributed to various factors, including insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, risks in key areas, and a complex external environment.Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts. Check out the complete article to see the details of these and other stocks.10 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street AnalystsSource: unsplash10. Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22On July 28, Cantor Fitzgerald raised its rating for Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) from Neutral to Overweight, signifying a more positive outlook on the company's prospects. Along with this upgrade, the analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald has set a new price target of $17, which represents an increase from the previous target of $13. The reasoning behind this upgrade lies in Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) robust performance during the second quarter, where it reported ""solid"" results. This indicates that the company is starting to experience the advantages of scale, which could potentially lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and improved profitability.Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR), as a prominent online education platform, has been gaining traction and popularity among learners worldwide. With its diverse course offerings and accessibility, it has been able to attract a broad user base. As more individuals seek to enhance their skills and knowledge through online education, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) position in the market becomes increasingly significant. The upgrade from Cantor Fitzgerald reflects the belief that Coursera's positive momentum is likely to continue and might even accelerate in the future. By realizing the benefits of scale, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) could potentially improve its margins and achieve better financial performance. This, in turn, could lead to increased investor confidence and attract more attention from the market.09. Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25On July 28, Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) received an upgrade from TD Securities. The company's rating was raised from Hold to Buy, indicating a more optimistic outlook on Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) future prospects. The analyst responsible for the upgrade, Steven Green, has maintained a price target of $21 on Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) shares. This price target represents the level at which TD Securities believes the stock could reach in the future and suggests the potential for significant growth from its current trading price. The upgrade to Buy from Hold suggests that TD Securities believes Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) stock has a strong potential for appreciation and may outperform the broader market or its industry peers.Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) is getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.Palm Valley Capital made the following comment about Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“For the full calendar year, the Fund’s top performers were Coterra Energy (ticker: CTRA), Amdocs, and Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI). Coterra’s stock rose sharply along with energy prices at the beginning of 2022. Amdocs delivered record operating results during the year and demonstrated the strength of its market position serving the world’s leading communication service providers. All the Fund’s precious metals holdings, led by Alamos, contributed positively to performance in 2022, with a 1% collective contribution from gold and silver equities. We think this was a good outcome relative to gold and silver prices that ended the year essentially flat, after a summer swoon. Additionally, precious metals miners were down, on average, in 2022.”08. Owens Corning (NYSE:OC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28JP Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut has recently upgraded Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) from Underweight to Neutral and simultaneously increased the price target from $95 to $133. This upgrade comes as a result of JP Morgan's positive outlook on the company's composite materials and roofing businesses. In a report released on July 28, Michael Rehaut stated that Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) composites margins have already experienced a notable decline in 2022 due to a softer demand environment. However, the roofing margins are expected to remain robust at least through the end of the year. This positive outlook on the roofing segment is likely a contributing factor to the upgrade. Although some investors may still have concerns about the company's elevated margins, JP Morgan believes that Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. The stock is currently valued at approximately 6.6 times the estimated EBITDA for 2023, which represents about a 5% discount compared to the company's five-year average and a 15% discount compared to its ten-year average. This upgrade and optimistic analysis may attract increased interest in Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) stock as the company's prospects appear to have improved, especially in its composite materials and roofing businesses.07. New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28On July 28, JPMorgan upgraded its rating for New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) from Neutral to Overweight, signaling a more positive outlook on the company's future prospects. Along with this upgrade, JPMorgan has also increased the price target for New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) stock from $13 to $16, reflecting higher expectations for its potential growth.One of the key factors driving this upgrade is the bank's second-quarter performance, which marked the first full quarter to include the impact of the recently added Signature teams. These newly integrated teams likely bring valuable expertise and assets to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB), and their contributions are now more accurately reflected in the financial results.As a result of having a better understanding of the earnings potential of the combined company with the addition of Signature teams, JPMorgan has revised its earnings estimates significantly higher for the years 2023-2024. This suggests that JPMorgan believes the integration of the Signature teams has positively impacted New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) financial performance and could continue to do so in the coming years.06. The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34On July 28, BTIG upgraded its rating for The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) from Neutral to Buy with a $103 price target. BTIG believes the company's improving fundamentals could lead to stronger results in the current year and drive faster growth with margin improvement in the future. Initially, BTIG was positive about The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) market position but had concerns about aggressive 2023 expectations. However, their view has completely reversed now. According to BTIG analysts, the programmatic market is growing at a substantial pace of 20% to 25% annually, driven by increased ad spend on lower funnel digital formats and automation outside of search and social platforms. The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is already established in connected TV and Retail Media segments and is seen as an attractive alternative to DV360, indicating the potential to surpass high-end market growth. BTIG acknowledges that valuing The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) can be complex and evaluated the company using a discounted cash flow method, excluding executive stock-based compensation packages for a comprehensive understanding of its value.Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund made the following comment about The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is the leading internet advertising demand-side platform, enabling programmatic (automated) buying of digital advertising. The company is benefiting from the growth in CTV, while also expanding its market share as advertisers find its neutral positioning in the market attractive; the company only operates on one side of the market (the buy side) as opposed to Google which also purchases ads for its own assets (such as YouTube). Thus, Google operates under a structural potential conflict of interests: on the one hand, its advertising customers are interested in paying as little as possible for the ads they purchase, but on the other hand, its publishing assets such as YouTube, are interested in getting as much as possible for the ads they sell. Trade Desk’s management continues showing excellent performance under an uncertain macro backdrop. In its last quarterly results, the company reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth with 50% adjusted EBITDA margins, while also providing outlook that was slightly above expectations. This revenue growth rate is quite impressive when considered against the negative growth rates reported by most other digital advertisers, including -2% for Google search and -4% for Meta.

68,1fa5ae6b-0630-3110-8ce7-fc8b3fe8060c,BA,2023-07-31,How Smart Money Is Playing The $700 Billion EV Boom,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-money-playing-700-billion-000000699.html,1690761600,STORY,"['VMAR', 'BA', 'EH', 'HON', 'WPRT', 'RIVN', 'QS', 'REVG', 'BLDP']","[China is the “800-pound gorilla” of global EV supplies, and it dominates this market in every way, including sales. Last year, China’s exports of EVs increased 131.8% YoY to some 680,000 units, based on official data. In the first half of 2023, the Chinese sold 2,093,000 EVs.Last year’s and this year’s global EV markets are breaking all kinds of records, but China is the clear frontrunner—by miles—accounting for around 60% of global electric car sales, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). More than half of the EVs on the roads today, are in China, and it’s already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy vehicles.In Europe, the second largest market, EV sales rose by over 15% in 2022, while sales in the United States – the third largest market – increased 55% in 2022, reaching a global share of 8%.Electric vehicle sales are set for a 35% year-on-year increase in 2023, with national policies and incentives providing further impetus for producers and consumers. So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors, especially considering that the top 14 EV stocks with only a fraction of the market capitalization of their traditional auto giant peers ended up outperforming them on the stock market.And the next wave is in the water.The recreational electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.As the electric vehicle playing field shifts to the waterways, it’s not surprising to find celebrity figures such as NFL superstar Tom Brady joining in by buying an electric boat racing team for the inaugural UIM E1 World Championship, which will launch in early 2024.But Vision Marine is already on the waterways with, with a first-of-its-kind proprietary outboard motor and powertrain powering the newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat, which made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries set to start this summer.Story continuesThe boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.This is only the beginning.VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system can turn any boat into an electric boat.And its sales strategy removes any notion of the unwanted cash burn that EV manufacturers are burdening investors with right now. VMAR plans to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs in an incredibly savvy move in a market flooded with struggling, cash-negative EV makers. VMAR is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year.VMAR is also developing an electric system for pontoons and a major second revenue chain that involves completely flipping the massive boat rental market from ICE to electric.With the build-out well underway, VMAR now says it is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.The World’s Most Powerful Electric PowertrainVision Marine has already made history once.Last fall, the company broke the world electric boat speed record at 109 MPH in a 100% electric boat in the Lake of the Ozarks Shootout, the largest boating event of the year in North America.Now, it’s about to do it again, on a journey that (in their own words) “will challenge the limits of what was thought possible”.Armed with cutting-edge electric propulsion technology, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR), is equipping its Zenith pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America. This month, they will embark on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida. Vision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a pricing perspective, it beats everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.For Vision Marine, this first-mover advantage is key, and it’s already received advance orders from OEMs.Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received an initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024. VMAR also plans to completely transform  the massive, global boat rental market already valued at well over $18 billion and on its way to topping $30 billion by 2031.Here, too, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) is in a leadership position, with its flagship Newport business serving 300,000 clients in the first three years, and annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin. The plan for the rest of this year is to build this out with two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and the launch of a franchise model. After that, it’s smooth sailing and all about scaling, scaling, scaling.By the end of 2024, Nasdaq-listed Vision Marine expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.The Start of a $12-Billion Transition in the WaterFrom NFL superstar Tom Brady and the first-ever electric boat racing world cup to two history-making VMAR records, the waterways are undergoing a sea change. This is the biggest transition in boating history since the first gasoline-powered outboard motors came on the market in 1896.The global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031. More specifically, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is poised to reach $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% over the next 8 years. The marine battery market, too, is explosive, and represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.All the hype isn’t just about climate change, either—though that is the driving impetus. Water-lovers appreciate the absence of extremely noisy gasoline-powered boat motors and enjoy the peaceful quiet of electric, as well as the fact that from a safety perspective, there is no risk of gasoline leakage or carbon monoxide poisoning. Also adding to the attraction is longer-term savings, not just in gasoline, but also in maintenance costs. Electric outboard motors are said to require far less maintenance, making them cheaper overall to operate.The world is at the beginning of a ~$12-billion transition to electric boats, and Vision Marine Technologies seems to be the frontrunner in this new, fast-moving space, breaking all kinds of records and following a sales strategy that avoids the cash-burn typical of this space.Other EV niches to keep an eye on: Rivian Automotive Inc.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Illumina Illumina Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Chief Commercial Officer Susan Tousi was not the only time they sold Illumina shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$210 per share in a -US$1.0m sale. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$192. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Susan Tousi sold a total of 6.00k shares over the year at an average price of US$206. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Illumina Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Illumina. Specifically, Chief Commercial Officer Susan Tousi ditched US$1.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Illumina insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$47m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Illumina Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Illumina stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Illumina.

AI Recommended Energy Stocks in JulySource: PopTika / ShutterstockAn infrastructure services company, Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR) provides solutions for electric power, pipeline, industrial and communications industries. Some of its capabilities include the planning, design, and installation of most types of network infrastructure. Since the beginning of the year, PWR has been a highflyer, gaining over 43% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 51%.As one of the best renewable energy stocks, Quanta delivers expertise across multiple avenues, including solar and wind power engineering, procurement, and construction. In addition, it features acumen in battery energy storage systems (BESS), renewable energy repowering solutions, and hydrogen pipeline installation and maintenance, among several other services. It even goes into the realm of carbon capture.Story continuesTo be fair, because of the current chart performance, PWR carries a rich earnings premium. However, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise. Plus, analysts appreciate the idea, pegging PWR a consensus strong buy. The experts’ high-side target stands at $228, implying over 13% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the skyrocketing renewable stocks to consider.Ormat (ORA)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockAn enticing idea for renewable energy stocks, Ormat (NYSE:ORA) supplies alternative and renewable geothermal energy technology. Per its public profile, Ormat built over 190 power plants and installed over 3,200 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Since the start of the year, ORA slipped 1%. In the trailing one-year period, shares gained a modest 3% of equity value.Fundamentally, though, Ormat deserves consideration as one of the top green energy stocks because of its geothermal energy solution, which ultimately involves extracting power out of the earth’s heat energy. It’s clean, renewable, and imposes a relatively small footprint, making the platform a viable idea. To be fair, ORA trades at a rich earnings multiple. As well, it only prints middling strength in the balance sheet. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it a worthwhile speculation for those investing in renewable energy.Lastly, analysts peg ORA as a consensus hold. Their average price target comes in at $91.25, implying over 8% upside potential.Plug Power (PLUG)A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.One of the riskiest ideas among the best renewable energy stocks for speculators, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) focuses on the development of hydrogen fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles. On a technical level, PLUG attracts plenty of attention because of its massive chart mobility. For example, PLUG’s 52-week range goes from $7.39 to $12.80.During the peak of its power in early 2021, shares traded hands at an average weekly price of nearly $67. Since then, the valuation of the enterprise eroded, especially during 2022 when the Federal Reserve implemented a hawkish monetary policy.Financially, Plug Power’s narrative centers on its aspirations. Fueling optimism is the top line, which has seen impressive expansion since 2020. Otherwise, it features a long road to profitability, which may dissuade conservative investors. Nevertheless, analysts are willing to gamble on PLUG, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $18.68, implying nearly 51% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The new unit represents a long-term investment in the state's clean energy future and will provide reliable, emissions-free energy to customers for decades to come.""The Plant Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear expansion is another incredible example of how Georgia Power is building a reliable and resilient energy future for our state,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""It is important that we make these kinds of long-term investments and see them through so we can continue providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our 2.7 million customers. Today's achievement is a testament to our commitment to doing just that, and it marks the first day of the next 60 to 80 years that Vogtle Unit 3 will serve our customers with clean, reliable energy.""Vogtle Unit 3 is the first newly-constructed nuclear unit in the U.S. in over 30 years and can power an estimated 500,000 homes and businesses. Once all four units are online, the Plant Vogtle site will be the largest generator of clean energy in the nation and support continued growth in Georgia as more industries, businesses and families come to the state.""Today is a historic day for the State of Georgia, Southern Company, and the entire energy sector, as we continue transforming the way we power the lives of millions of Americans,"" said Chris Womack, president and CEO of Southern Company. ""With Unit 3 completed, and Unit 4 in the final stages of construction and testing, this project shows just how new nuclear can and will play a critical role in achieving a clean energy future for the United States. Bringing this unit safely into service is a credit to the hard work and dedication of our teams at Southern Company and the thousands of additional workers who have helped build that future at this site, as well as all of the partners who have helped make this day a reality.""Story continuesNuclear energy is the only zero-emission baseload energy source available today, offering high reliability, and efficient operations around the clock. Nuclear energy currently provides approximately 25% of Georgia Power's overall energy mix, including the existing units at Plant Vogtle and Georgia's other nuclear facility at Plant Hatch in Baxley, Georgia.""The Vogtle expansion is an American energy success story and would not be possible without the support of strong public and private partners like our partners at North America's Building Trades Unions,"" said Tom Fanning, chairman of the Board of Directors for Southern Company. ""We continue to appreciate their support and those who have stood with us at the local, state and federal levels to complete this new clean energy source to serve electric customers. Providing leadership in our industry and a commitment to safety and quality are in Southern Company's DNA. Today's milestone at the Vogtle expansion site underscores this legacy, and I couldn't be prouder of the dedication our teams have shown in seeing Unit 3 through to completion."" The final stages of construction and testing continue at Vogtle Unit 4, with the unit projected to be placed in service during the late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter of 2024.  The unit completed hot functional testing in May, in significantly less time than Unit 3 as the team continues leveraging best practices and learnings from the earlier unit. The Vogtle site has also received nuclear fuel for Unit 4, with a total of 157 fuel assemblies necessary for the safe and reliable startup of the unit.Also, last week, Georgia Power announced the receipt of the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for Vogtle Unit 4. This finding was confirmed in an official letter received by Southern Nuclear and signifies that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations. No further NRC findings are necessary in order for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup sequence for the new unit.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.About Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO), America's premier energy company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best August Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the stock market, various strategies may gain popularity at different times, but investors consistently gravitate toward dividend stocks due to their ability to generate regular cash. As of the beginning of 2023, there has been a resurgence in the popularity and performance of tech stocks, while dividend stocks have been trailing behind in terms of investor interest and returns.Overall, the S&amp;P 500 experienced sluggish growth in dividend payments during the second quarter of 2023. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, 460 companies increased their dividends in Q2 2023, down 17.1% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that total dividend increases were $9.80 billion during this period, compared with $19.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsThe ongoing concerns over inflation and fears of a potential recession have prompted investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks. Historically, dividends have shown strong performance during economic downturns, making them more appealing among income investors. We recently reported Refinitiv Lipper’s data which highlighted that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received a significant boost with $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This surge represents the highest two-week increase for the ETF since January.To increase their cash flow, investors often prioritize companies with a history of strong dividend growth. By investing in such firms, investors can potentially benefit from both regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. According to a report by iShares, dividend growers outperformed dividend cutters and eliminators during both bull and bear markets from 1978 to 2021. These equities also recorded an overall strong performance than non-dividend payers during this period. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best dividend stocks to consider that have increased their dividends for decades.Story continuesDividend Capture Strategy:Within the broad category of dividend investing, various related strategies exist to help investors generate wealth. The dividend capture strategy is one of the known investment approaches where investors aim to profit from capturing dividend payments of specific stocks. The goal is to buy the stock just before the ex-dividend date, hold it long enough to receive the dividend, and then promptly sell it. By repeatedly executing this process with different dividend-paying stocks, investors can generate a stream of income from dividends.10 Best August Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list features the dividend capture strategy for selecting notable dividend stocks set to trade ex-dividend in August 2023.

Historically, dividends have shown strong performance during economic downturns, making them more appealing among income investors. We recently reported Refinitiv Lipper’s data which highlighted that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received a significant boost with $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Fastest-Growing Blue-Collar Jobs.Remote Work for Blue Collar JobsWe know that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of remote work. However, it was not just for white-collar professionals but also for lower-paid service workers, including blue-collar employees in different industries. Remote work for blue-collar workers like desk receptionists was largely facilitated by programs like Zoom Video Communications, Inc (NASDAQ:ZM)’s video conferring, which allowed them to connect with customers across states and even across the country and provided a sense of being in the same room.The ability to work remotely has significantly impacted the labor force participation rate, which increased from 62.2% to 62.6% in June 2023, with more workers seeking remote roles. About 20% of active job seekers are now looking exclusively for remote work. The option to work from home has particularly benefited women aged 25 to 54, with their participation rate reaching a record 77.8%.Blue-collar industries, such as restaurants and retail, have also embraced remote work as a solution to severe labor shortages. For instance, the restaurant chain Baby Jack's implemented remote drive-thru workers and saw a surge in job applications. In addition, Bite Ninja, a sister company that employs remote gig workers and serves multiple fast-food chains across several states, provides new job opportunities for stay-at-home mothers, the disabled, and college students.What are the Highest-Paying Blue-Collar Jobs?Power plant operators, aircraft technicians, and petroleum pump system operators are a few of the highest-paying blue-collar jobs. However, if we are speaking numbers here, Air Traffic Controller is one of the high-paying blue-collar jobs with a six-figure salary. Moreover, one of the best blue-collar jobs is an Electrician. This is because the role offers job stability and steady demand as electrical systems are integral to modern life.Story continuesElectricians have opportunities for career advancement and can earn competitive wages with relatively short training periods.

Majority of its employees are hourly workers at its approximately 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), despite forecasting flat sales and lower profits for 2023, implemented a $1 billion pay hike for its frontline workers. This strategic move was aimed at maintaining Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)’s industry-leading position and attracting high-quality workers.Recently, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) announced to invest over $700 million to increase their hourly wages for their frontline workers.

Moreover, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) has also offered an educational program providing up to $21,000 for continuing education opportunities, free financial coaching, and access to counseling services.Is AI threatening Blue Collar Jobs?Despite some promising blue collar jobs, there are concerns that the rapid growth of AI, exemplified by language models like ChatGPT, poses both opportunities and challenges for the blue-collar job market as automation may lead to the displacement of 85 million jobs in the next 2 years.AI chatbots and virtual assistants can decrease the demand for manual labor in industries like manufacturing and customer service. Between 400 million and 800 million individuals worldwide may face unemployment due to automation by 2030.

83,deb4a189-a2ef-39dc-9b66-a7e1c124f133,NAVI,2023-07-31,Navient's (NASDAQ:NAVI) investors will be pleased with their impressive 171% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navients-nasdaq-navi-investors-pleased-132156293.html,1690723316,STORY,['NAVI'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. To wit, the Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) share price has flown 138% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. It's also good to see the share price up 16% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Navient To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Navient achieved compound earnings per share growth of 26% per year. In comparison, the 33% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Navient's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Navient, it has a TSR of 171% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Navient shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Navient better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Navient , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.We will like Navient better if we see some big insider buys.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The 20-slot rule has investors imagine they get a stock investment punch card that has only 20 slots available. After making 20 investments, they can’t make anymore. Such an exercise really focuses your mind to only choosing the best stocks to buy.“You’d really have to think carefully about what you did,” Buffett said. “And you’d be forced to load up on what you really think about. So you’d do much better.” So, if you think of your next investment as one of only a handful you can buy in your lifetime, it should probably be one of these three stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsApple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is certainly one that Buffett likely believes everyone should own. It is his single biggest investment that represents more than 46% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio – and there’s solid reasoning behind such a large bet.Although products generate the most revenue, services are the most profitable. iPhones, Macs and other hardlines had 36% gross margins on $74 billion in sales. The App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud had $21 billion in sales, but margins of 71%. Services growth is where Apple’s future lies.But don’t ignore the growth in products, because they fuel the services business. The iPhone in particular is a massive driving force. Wall Street often gets it wrong when it comes to predicting the lifespan of Apple’s premiere product. Yet there is plenty more to come and at least one analyst sees that Apple is one of the best stocks to buy.Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, predicts Apple is poised to benefit from another major upgrade cycle. He estimates there are 250 million iPhones that have not been upgraded in the past four years. The next iteration of the iPhone will drive consumers to purchase a new one. They will also likely pay more for the device, boosting Apple’s revenue and profits. Ives also predicts services will soon be a $100 billion business for Apple.Story continuesApple’s stock is not cheap on traditional metrics like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales. The tech giant, though, has rarely been a discounted stock. However the opportunity for growth remains clear for the foreseeable future. Apple is one of the best single investment stocks you can buy today.Genuine Parts (GPC)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) may seem an odd choice for a must-own stock. This boring company owns the 9,600-store NAPA Auto Parts chain. It also owns an industrial replacement parts and supplies distribution business serving repair shops, service stations and fleet operators. It may seem lackluster, but it’s actually one of the best stocks to buy. Genuine Parts was founded in 1928. It survived recessions and depressions, world wars, political upheavals, natural disasters and a global pandemic or two. It also paid a dividend for 75 years. Genuine Parts has raised the payout for 67 consecutive years. That makes it a Dividend King, a small, select group of stocks that increased their dividend for 50 years or more. The retailer is benefitting from unique circumstances in the auto industry. There remains a critical shortage of parts and labor at vehicle manufacturers. Fewer vehicles are making it to dealer lots, forcing consumers to keep their existing vehicles on the road longer. That increases demand for replacement parts, thereby allowing Genuine Parts to raise its prices.Genuine Parts reported record second quarter sales of $5.9 billion last week. It generated adjusted profits of $2.44 per share, up 11% from last year. The retailer also raised full-year earnings guidance from a range of $8.95 to $9.10 per share to $9.15 to $9.30 per share.Genuine Parts trades at 15 times next year’s earnings and for a fraction of sales. With a dividend payout ratio of just 44%, there’s plenty of safety built in with more room for further increases.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) S&amp;P 500 displayed on a stock chart. SPY stock.Source: Immersion Imagery / ShutterstockArguably even more head-scratching than Genuine Parts for inclusion on this list is the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). Yet the exchange traded fund is here because of its superior historical performance. Over rolling 20-year periods for the past century, it never had a losing year.According to data from Crestmont Research, between 1900 and 2023 the SPDR ETF enjoyed 104 consecutive years of positive returns for investors. It analyzed the rolling 20-year total returns, including dividends paid. So long as an investor held and didn’t sell, they would never have a year of negative returns. It goes to show the old adage that the plain vanilla choice of investing — the S&amp;P 500 index — is still the best option for most investors. Buy it, set it and forget it. The S&amp;P 500 was not actually created until 1957. Crestmont Research had to look at other indexes with similar components that did exist back then. It was able to extrapolate their data and estimate the hypothetical returns going back to the start of the century.Perhaps even better for investors, though, is that today’s stock market is much different than it was back in 1900 — or even 1957 for that matter. More current returns are even better. That’s why I say that for the vast majority of investors the SPDR 500 ETF Trust is one of the best stocks to buy. On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

Tour de Turtles is a fun, educational event that follows the migration of sea turtles from their nesting beaches to their feeding grounds and, ultimately, provides scientific data on how best to protect their species.Teams from Disney Conservation and the Sea Turtle Conservancy released two sea turtles July 29, 2023, as part of the 16th annual Tour de Turtles event at Disney’s Vero Beach Resort.

Not unlike Gabbie, another character in the film who enlists a motley crew of so-called spiritual experts to help rid their home of supernatural squatters – Tour de Turtles brings together a team of researchers from the STC and Disney Conservation annually to undertake a daunting mission - using satellite telemetry to track two female turtles to determine where and how far they swim during the migration season.Each turtle swims to raise awareness about various threats to sea turtle survival. The turtle to swim the furthest distance will win the Tour de Turtles race.""Disney's commitment to sea turtle conservation in Vero Beach spans 20 years, and we are very proud to have recently watched our 1.5 millionth sea turtle hatchling leave the nest and shuffle its way to the ocean,"" said Mark Penning, Vice President of Disney's Animals, Science and Environment.

""Disney's commitment to conservation, passion for environmental education, and effectiveness at communicating with audiences have made the Tour de Turtles a fun and successful program since it was launched over a decade ago.""In addition to Tour de Turtles, the Disney Conservation team has dedicated nearly 19,000 hours to studying and monitoring sea turtle nests during the summer nesting season along the five-mile coastline at Disney's Vero Beach Resort. From approximately May to October, Disney Vacation Club members and resort guests also have the opportunity to assist the team by joining outings to observe real-time sea turtle research while learning how they can take action to protect sea turtles. So far this year, the Disney Conservation team has a record-breaking number of nests along their survey route – nearly 2,000 by August, well above the average 1,500 normally counted in an entire season.Tour de Turtles is a research and education program of the Sea Turtle Conservancy and Disney's support is just one example of bringing Disney Planet Possible to life by taking action to make a happier, healthier planet possible for all.

The resort is located less than a two-hour drive from the Walt Disney World Resort, and its design reflects the Treasure Coast region where it is situated. Disney Vacation Club, a leader in vacation ownership, debuted in 1991 with a flexible, vacation points-based system rather than the traditional fixed-week timeshare model. Disney Vacation Club Members are able to choose from among a variety of exciting vacation destinations, including a stay at any Disney Vacation Club Resort or one of thousands of other vacation options in destinations around the world.ABOUT DISNEY'S ""HAUNTED MANSION""Inspired by the classic theme park attraction, Disney's ""Haunted Mansion"" is about a woman and her son who enlist a motley crew of so-called spiritual experts to help rid their home of supernatural squatters.Directed by Justin Simien, the film features an all-star cast ensemble including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Chase W. Dillon and Daniel Levy, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto as The Hatbox Ghost. The film's producers are Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich, with Nick Reynolds and Tom Peitzman serving as executive producers. Teams from Disney Conservation and the Sea Turtle Conservancy released two sea turtles July 29, 2023, as part of the 16th annual Tour de Turtles event at Disney’s Vero Beach Resort.

Its linear TV business is declining, and so are subscribers to its flagship streaming service Disney+.That makes the move to take sports network ESPN fully over-the-top as high-stakes as it can get. Sports has long been viewed by the industry as a key content category to lure in loyal viewers.The risk, though, is that while audiences are willing to pay for the network as part of the traditional cable bundle, they may not be so interested in subscribing to a standalone streaming service.But its one Disney CEO Bob Iger seems willing to take.""Sports stands very tall in the media landscape for its ability to convene millions of people all at once,"" Iger said earlier this month, reiterating his bullish stance on ESPN and confirming plans to take the network fully over-the-top as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform.Analysts and media watchers have cautioned the full transition to streaming will be a difficult journey, particularly when it comes to consumers footing the bill for an additional streaming service versus watching sports as part of the cable bundle.ESPN charges pay-TV operators between $8 and $9 per subscriber, according to an estimate from SNL Kagan. To compare, ESPN+'s average revenue per user is $5.64.""In a future world of streaming, it's à la carte, meaning if you want to pay for it you have to actually go out and pay for it. There isn't going to be somebody subsidizing you,"" Brandon Nispel, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance.Nispel, who has a Sector Weight rating on the stock, pointed to recent KeyBanc survey data that showed a ""low willingness to pay.""In a note published on June 29, the analyst wrote, ""Who's going to pay $30+/month for ESPN? Not many.""Disney hasn’t disclosed any details regarding pricing, although analysts have estimated the service would need a minimum cost of around $30 a month in order to break even — let alone turn a profit.Story continues""From our survey work, we found consumer interest in sports is relatively high in linear, though willingness to pay in streaming is low: we found &gt;25% of subscribers would not be willing to pay for a pure sports streaming service, 46% of subscribers would be willing to pay &lt;$10/month, and 26% would pay &gt;$20/month.""""The future profitability in sports is really the question,"" Nispel said. ""How many people would sign up and then what's the profitability profile? Going from linear to streaming is much more difficult, because you don't have the masses subsidizing.""Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, ""It's a huge, huge risk to massively disrupt the bundle, which is already [in decline.] It's just a massive, extra disruptive event to put sports completely streaming over-the-top.""The analyst, who has a Neutral rating on Disney and $94 price target, added ESPN would likely have to offer different incentives, along with the ability to turn the service on and off given the fragmented nature of sports fans.""There are a lot of people that might be sports specific,"" the analyst said. ""So you might not necessarily want the thing year-round, or you might only want it for the first two months of the season.""As a result, ESPN will likely ""have to give that minimum price to generate as many possible subscribers as they can, but the real way to make money is going to be from targeted advertising on the service,"" he continued.On top of pricing, another question revolves around how many subscription services people are even willing to pay for, especially within streaming's oversaturated marketplace. ESPN+ currently boasts 25.3 million subscribers.""The consumer taps out at 7 to 8 streaming services a month [at] about $60 to $70 a month,"" Mark Boidman, partner and global head of media at Solomon Partners, told Yahoo Finance.""So what happens then? People go to bars to watch sports for free, they go to a friend's house to watch it, they try to find it for free on some site. Young people are even fine just watching the highlights on TikTok,"" he said.Still, Boidman maintained he continues to see value in sports. After all, ESPN has seen an uptick in TV viewership, which climbed 8% year-over-year in 2022, despite sharp declines in linear subscribers, which dropped to 74 million at the end of last year from 100 million in 2011, according to an SEC filing.But that value may diminish over time as the transition to streaming takes hold.""The question is will [sports be valued] the same way as it had been valued historically, because everybody who had a TV subscription was indirectly paying for sports, even if they didn't watch any sports. That's going to certainly change because people are no longer going to be paying for things that they don't want to consume,"" he said.""For streaming, there will be value, and it'll be paid for by consumers directly and paid for by advertising and paid for by packaging sports content into Prime-type memberships or other things. So people will still pay for sports indirectly, but they may not pay for it directly and certainly not at those [historic] price points.""Who will be ESPN's strategic partner?Disney CEO Bob Iger speaks at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum on Sept. 25, 2019, in New York.(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)Disney's Iger said the company is open to strategic partners, either through a joint venture or part ownership, to enable ESPN to make the transition to DTC.In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Iger said he's looking for partners that ""come with value"" — whether that be content value, distribution value, or capital value to de-risk the business. If that's found, ""we're going to be very open-minded about that."" He said there have been ""some"" conversations with possible partners but did not elaborate on potential names or timelines.On Thursday, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh shot down the possibility of NBC partnering with Disney.""I've been asked about and read the speculation that, in some way, we might be interested in swapping businesses [with Disney] as part of what's going on in the sports space,"" he said.""I would just say that, that's very improbable given [there's] tremendous issues around tax, minority shareholders, and structuring generally. So I would put aside the idea that there's anything inorganic that is likely to happen around ESPN, in particular.""Disney has held exploratory talks with major sports leagues including the NFL, NBA, and MLB regarding strategic partnerships, according to a source with knowledge of Disney's plans.""I really struggled with understanding why the leagues would do that,"" KeyBanc's Nispel said. ""It seems almost like a conflict of interest, if you will, because the leagues get paid by ESPN. If they have ownership in ESPN, they would be sort of favored to continue to provide the rights to ESPN over others.""Nispel said Disney will likely need to find multiple partners and that the media giant will need to make ""difficult decisions"" in terms of the content they keep in order to capture the broadest audience possible.A button for ESPN+ is on a remote control in Portland, Ore., Aug. 13, 2022. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)Another potential strategic partner could be Apple (AAPL).Iger, who appeared at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, touted a new collaboration between the two companies focused on Apple's recently announced VR headset, which Iger said ""lends itself to sports.""At the time, the executive revealed users will be able to watch movies and TV shows from Disney+, in addition to a more immersive sports viewing experience.Another bonus? Apple has a lucrative deal with Major League Soccer (MLS), which has recently seen a boost following international soccer star Lionel Messi's decision to join MLS.""Streaming is a lower margin business and the only way that it really works is through global distribution,"" Nispel said, calling out the potential upside with Apple and its MLS partnership.The analyst said, at this point, Disney is likely considering all options: ""I think it goes down the list of basically everybody.""Disney will report quarterly earnings results on Aug. 9.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

These 3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows May Deliver Soon.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-bounce-back-3-stocks-172342020.html,1690219422,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'DIS', 'CPB', 'NDAQ']","[If you’re looking for stocks to rebound, the relatively strong performance of the S&amp;P 500 in 2023 is up nearly 19% year-to-date, so you won’t be able to find as many options as you once could.A quick screen of the index’s stocks shows 25 at a new high and just two at a new low. I need three bounce-back stocks for this article, so I must broaden my search. Per Finviz.com, 11 S&amp;P 500 stocks are trading within 5% of their 52-week lows. That makes my life a little easier. However, of the 11, none are from the technology sector. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s not surprising. Technology has the highest performance YTD of the 11 sectors in the index, with a 47.2% return through July 19. The worst-performing sector? Utilities and energy are tied at -6.1%. Neither is represented in the group of 11. I have six sectors to choose from for my three bounce-back stock selections. Let’s look at communication services, financial, and consumer defensive/staples.   Walt Disney (DIS)Entrance to Walt Disney World park. DIS stock.Source: VIAVAL TOURS / ShutterstockWhen Bob Iger handed over the reins as CEO of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) to Bob Chapek in February 2020, I’m confident he didn’t think he’d be trapped in the troubling situation he currently finds himself in.  Disney stock is trading within 3% of its 52-week low of $84.07. It’s down 16% over the past year and 22% over the past five years. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up 62% over the past five years. Barron’s recently published an article discussing Disney’s six major problems, some of which weren’t Chapek’s creation but rather Iger himself. The most obvious is his push into streaming with Disney+. Right now, Iger is facing a perfect storm. He’s in a hurry to deliver a profitable streaming platform — a 2024 projection for Disney+ making money — but the actors and writers strike means he won’t have a full slate of content to keep subscribers happy. The article suggests that its assets might not be as valuable as Iger believes. For example, only value investors would consider taking a run at ABC. As for ESPN, it’s seeing the cost of content moving higher while the benefits of cable diminish daily. Even its theme parks appear ready to take a step backward. The cash cow of Disney — if that goes, Disney stock could soon be trading below $50.Story continuesSo, why buy DIS stock?If you look at Disney’s chart, it hasn’t consistently traded below $100 since 2014. Its business is much bigger today, and almost all of the issues are solvable, but it will take time. With Iger signed through 2026, he has time to figure things out.The risk/reward proposition seems tilted in the investor’s favor for the first time in a long time.Nasdaq (NDAQ)Nasdaq 100 stocks: the Nasdaq building lit up at nightSource: ShutterstockIronically, Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) trades within 2% of its 52-week low when the Nasdaq Composite Index is up more than 36% YTD. I guess the company isn’t techie enough for investors.Nasdaq reported Q2 2023 results on July 19. It managed to earn 71 cents a share in the quarter, 5 cents higher than the analyst estimate. On the top line, its revenue increased by 4% to $925 million.  Since Adena Friedman became CEO of the company in November 2016, she’s pushed it away from market-sensitive businesses, such as IPOs, to more tech-focused revenue streams. For example, in the second quarter, Nasdaq acquired Adenza for $10.5 billion. Adenza makes risk management and regulatory software for banks and investment firms. It is Nasdaq’s largest acquisition in its history. Adena generates nearly $600 million in annual revenue. Investors are likely worried that the company is overly leveraged relative to its historical norm. Friedman disagrees. “We think we paid an appropriate price for an exceptional asset, but helping people understand how exceptional the opportunity is, I think, is going to take some time,” Friedman stated in June.Getting further away from its transaction-focused roots will pay dividends down the road.Campbell Soup (CPB)A variety of Campbell's soups in a grocery store. CPB stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / ShutterstockIt was either Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) or Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG). I decided to go with the former because it had a higher free cash flow yield — 3.7% compared to 2.5% — and I’m addicted to soup of any kind. On a more serious note, both companies haven’t done very well financially — or in the supermarkets — in recent years. CPB is down 17% in 2023, a little more than 2% over the past year, and up 13.7% in the past five years, 77% less than the S&amp;P 500. At the end of June, Barron’s contributor Al Root wrote a good piece about what’s wrong with the current markets using Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and CPB as examples. “Things are harder for Campbell because it is facing pressure from private labels, wrote Stifel analyst Matthew Smith in a June report. ‘Shares currently trade below 11 times using our calendar 2023 Ebitda estimate, a 15% discount to peers, which we believe appropriately balances the slower top line trajectory and risk volumes do not recover as pricing diminishes,’” Root wrote on June 30.As Root points out, it trades at a 21% discount to the index. Translation: By some valuation metrics, including market capitalization to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), it’s a value play right now. I say some because Campbell’s free cash flow yield of 3.7% is below what I consider fair value and a reasonable buy (4-8% is fair value, and above 8% is value territory). However, as recently as 2020, its free cash flow was nearly $1.1 billion, nearly double the trailing 12 months. Further, its shareholder yield — dividend yield plus buyback yield — is 4.39%, the highest since 2017.  When its volumes turn positive as inflation subsides and consumers get more comfortable spending on brand-name products, its cash flow will accelerate.   On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Markets were also awaiting more cues on the U.S. economy from nonfarm payrolls data due later in the week.Brent oil futures fell 0.3% to $84.14 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $80.35 a barrel by 22:258 ET (02:28 GMT).China stimulus in focus after weak PMIsData on Monday showed that Chinese manufacturing activity shrank for a fourth straight month in July, while broader business activity also deteriorated as the country struggles with a slowing post-COVID economic recovery.But concerns over the weak data were largely offset by expectations of more stimulus measures from the country, with media reports suggesting that officials are set to unveil more spending measures later on Monday.Monday’s data furthered the case for more fiscal support for the economy, as it struggles with weak spending and slowing inflation.While Chinese oil imports have remained close to record levels this year, fuel demand in the country has remained well below pre-COVID levels. Oil bulls are betting that more stimulus measures in the country will help improve fuel consumption.Promises of more Chinese stimulus were also among the key factors behind an oil market rally over the past month, as the country’s top policymakers vowed to further support the economy.Oil set for best month since Jan 2022Despite stalling on Monday, oil price futures were set to add between 12% and 14% in July - their best monthly performance since January 2022.Story continuesSigns of tightening supplies, following production cuts by major oil exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia, were the biggest boost to the market over the past month.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Oversold Dividend Stocks to Invest In. Dividend investing stands as a highly significant investment strategy for generating reliable and stable cash flow. Over the years, dividend stocks demonstrated their ability to outperform the broader market on several occasions. This makes them an attractive choice for investors seeking both income and potential long-term growth. Moreover, dividend stocks have represented a significant portion of overall market returns. We also reported Hartford Fund’s data which revealed that dividends have accounted for approximately 41% of the index's total return on average from 1930 to 2022.Though investors favored tech growth stocks in early 2023, analysts believe that dividend stocks may make a comeback due to the potential for a mild recession. On July 18, Bank of America released a global fund manager survey indicating that sentiment has turned more bearish. The majority consensus is now leaning towards a mild recession in the last quarter of 2023. The main concerns cited by respondents include potential risks related to inflation, policy mistakes, and a credit crunch. To navigate this bearish sentiment, analysts advise adding dividend-paying stocks to portfolios as these stocks historically perform better during economic downturns compared to non-dividend ones.Dividend stocks are not completely recession-proof, but they tend to be more stable compared to high-growth or speculative stocks when the economy is going through a downturn. Last year’s bear market also showed a strong outperformance of dividend stocks in comparison with other asset classes. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index declined by 6.47% in 2022, whereas the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst performance since 2008, falling by over 19%. Investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their dividends for long periods of time rather than those with high yields. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their continuous commitment to shareholders for decades.Story continuesAlso read: 11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyWhen speaking about economic downturns, these periods can negatively impact investor confidence, leading to widespread selling across various stocks and causing some to become oversold.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Devon Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Devon Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Devon Energy. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. With 8.1% and 6.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Devon Energy Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$210m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Devon Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Devon Energy (including 2 which don't sit too well with us) .Ultimately the future is most important.

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick.Story continuesPatrick Kaltenbach: Thanks Adam, and good evening, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Tonight, we reported our second quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on page three of our presentation. Our sales growth in the second quarter included strong growth in our service business as well as solid performance across our industrial product categories, which was offset in part by softer market conditions in Laboratory and China. Focused execution of our margin expansion and cost control initiatives resulted in good growth in adjusted EPS despite currency being much greater-than-expected headwind this quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2023, there is increased uncertainty in the global economy and our end markets.In addition, market demand in China has deteriorated. While we have reduced our growth expectations for 2023 due to weaker market conditions, we remain confident in the factors we can control, including execution on our best-in-class sales and marketing programs and our margin expansion and cost-saving initiatives. Our team remains very agile in adapting to changing market conditions, and I'm confident that our efforts will deliver solid results this year. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance, and I will then come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn?Shawn Vadala: Thanks Patrick, and good evening, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $982.1 million, which represented an increase in local currency of 2%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales were flat as currency reduced sales growth by 2%. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 4% in Asia, rest of the world; 1% in the Americas and were flat in Europe. Local currency sales increased 3% in China in the quarter. On slide number five, we show sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 4% for the first six months, with 3% growth in both the Americas and Europe, and 6% growth in Asia, rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 6% in China on a year-to-date basis.On slide number six, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales decreased 3% and Industrial increased 6% with core industrial up 6% and product inspection up 5%. Food Retail grew 17% in the quarter as we benefited from significant project activity. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 1%; and Industrial increased 6%, including 6% growth across both core industrial and product inspection. Food Retail increased 25%. Let me now move to the rest of P&amp;L, which is summarized on slide number eight. Gross margin was 59.4%, an increase of 100 basis points as pricing was partially offset by higher cost, business mix and currency.R&amp;D amounted to $47.2 million in the quarter, which is a 6% increase in local currency over the prior period, reflecting increased project activity. SG&amp;A amounted to $228.6 million, a 6% decrease in local currency over the prior year and includes lower variable compensation and benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $307.7 million in the quarter, an 8% increase. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 4%. Adjusted operating margin was 31.3%, which represents an increase of 210 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&amp;L. Amortization amounted to $18 million in the quarter; interest expense was $19.3 million; and other income amounted to $1 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter, above our previously guided range of 18.5% for the full year.This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We now expect our tax rate to be 19% for the full year. Fully diluted shares amounted to 22.1 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $10.19, a 9% increase over the prior year or a 13% increase excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.69 as compared to $9.29 in in the prior year. Reported EPS the quarter includes $0.23 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.29 of restructuring costs. We also had a $0.02 benefit from tax items. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales grew 4% for the six-month period.Adjusted operating income increased 9% or 14% excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our operating margin expanded 190 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 9% on a year-to-date basis or 15%, excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&amp;L and let me comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $260.5 million, up $52 million, helped by favorable working capital. Year-to-date cash flow per share grew 44%. DSO was 35 days, while ITO was 3.7 times. Let me now turn to guidance. As we look to the remainder of the year, there's increased caution across our customer base such as pharma and biopharma, chemical companies and food manufacturing. And there's also greater uncertainty regarding the global economic conditions.In particular, conditions in China have deteriorated sharply as there is growing uncertainty around the pace of economic growth and limited government stimulus. This is particularly true with our pharma and biopharma customers who are delaying investment decisions in China, but also in the Americas and Europe. In Europe, the outlook remains uncertain in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine and soft general economic growth. Global manufacturing PMIs have also continued to trend lower and have been below the 50 growth -- no growth index level for many months. Now turning to our guidance. We expect local currency sales to be down 3% to 4% in the third quarter with a mid single digit decline in Laboratory. This reflects deteriorating conditions in China as mentioned earlier, with particularly soft demand from pharma and biopharma customers.Healthcare biology microscopegoodluz/Shutterstock.comWe also expect modest sales declines across our industrial businesses in the third quarter. We are implementing actions to reduce our costs in response to the softer sales environment and manage productivity, while maintaining various growth investments that are important for the future. We estimate our operating margin will increase in the 70 to 100 basis point range for 2023 based upon our disciplined approach to margin expansion, productivity and cost savings initiatives. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.85, representing a decline of 3% to 6%. This includes foreign exchange headwind to EPS of approximately 3%. Now turning to the full year 2023. Our local currency sales growth guide is now 0% to 1%, reflecting the factors mentioned earlier.This is down from our previous guidance of approximately 5% local currency sales growth. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $40.30 to $41.20, representing a growth rate of about 2% to 4% or approximately 5% to 7%, excluding unfavorable foreign currency. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $43.65 to $43.95. There are three factors to our revised adjusted earnings per share outlook. First, the reduced local currency sales growth forecast for the year compared to our previous guidance, partially offset by our cost reduction efforts. Our reduced outlook largely reflects a lower Laboratory sales forecast of a decline of low single digits, down from our previous mid single digit outlook. Additionally, we now see pronounced weakness in our business in China, where we now expect our total business to decline mid single digits for the year compared our prior forecast of high single digit growth.Secondly, foreign exchange, as mentioned earlier, is now expected to be a 3% to 4% headwind to EPS growth this year compared to 2% the last time we spoke, largely due to the weakening of Chinese renminbi and the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro. Relative to the impact on sales, currency is expected to be a 1% headwind to sales growth for the full year and roughly neutral in the third quarter. And third, we would now expect a higher tax rate of 19% in 2023 compared to our prior guidance of 18.5%. Some final details on guidance as you update your models. Total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization is forecast to be $72 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pretax basis or $0.93 per share.Interest expense is forecast at $78 million for the year. We now expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million compared to our previous estimate of approximately $900 million, and we'll also reduce our share repurchase program by a similar amount. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick.Patrick Kaltenbach: Thanks Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, where sales were softer than we had expected for the quarter. While we continue to see robust demand on hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, our pharma and biopharma customers have become increasingly cautious with their spending and have delayed investment decisions, particularly in China. As expected, our pipette sales were again weak in the second quarter as customers reduced inventories of chips and instrument sales declined. The impact of the lower pipette sales was in line with our previous expectations, and we continue to expect this headwind to ease in the second half of the year as comparisons become easier.As mentioned, we also see customers, especially in our key market segments such as pharma and biopharma delaying purchases. However, our pipeline and customer quoting activity has remained strong, and we were pleased to see continued strong service growth across our Lab business in the second quarter. We are hopeful conditions normalize soon, but we have not built this into our 2023 guidance. Turning now to our Industrial business. We again saw strong demand for our automation solutions from core industrial portfolio this quarter. While we expect to continue to benefit from customer investments in automation and localization of supply chains globally, we are not immune to the increased uncertainty around the global economic outlook. Regarding product inspection, it also had good performance this quarter, but our packaged food customers have also become more cautious about making investments in new equipment due to inflation and uncertain economic conditions, and we would expect softer results for the remainder of year.Finally, Food Retail delivered strong growth this quarter due to robust project activity in the Americas. Our Food Retail sales can be lumpy, and we would expect strong growth again in the third quarter. One final comment on the business. Service sales remained very strong overall and grew 13% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of our business. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe were flat in the quarter with growth in core industrial and product inspection, offset by declines in laboratory products. In the Americas, we saw good growth across our industrial and retail businesses offset by declines in our laboratory product offering, especially pipette.Finally, Asia and the rest of world had another quarter of good growth. China grew 3% with good growth in Industrial, but sentiment, particularly in Laboratory has become much more cautious as activity has slowed following the COVID reopening, and there has been limited economic stimulus as mentioned before. As of today, we expect a significant decline in sales in in China the second half of the year, but our team in China will remain agile to capitalize on growth opportunities however market conditions unfold. Now, I would like to share with you some updated thoughts about our strategic priorities and how we are investing to drive growth over the long-term. While market conditions have become increasingly challenged over the past year, we have remained at very high level of incremental investment to support the long-term growth of the organization and market share gains.The hallmark of or culture is the agility and focused execution, and our team continues to respond very well to unexpected changes in the environment to gain market share, expand profitability and make additional important growth investments for the future. Starting with our sales and marketing programs, we have developed increasingly sophisticated digital approaches with our Spinnaker program that more efficiently feeds our pipette -- our pipeline with new leads, [indiscernible] alerts with a special focus on customers that we do not do business today. Webinars have been an important areas of investment in sort of new customer leads as we look to increase potential customer interactions in a very efficient format. We can directly show how other solutions address common customer pain points in very specific end-use applications.We have had strong participation in our webinars, which positions us as trusted subject matter subject experts in specific applications, but also provides a good sales pipeline as customers seek unique solutions to challenging or new applications. This is particularly true in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, sustainable materials and the semiconductor industry. Our data-centric approach in nurturing and qualifying these leads allows field sales team to prioritize their efforts on hyper potential business opportunities and increase our win rates. We have also continued to invest very strongly in research and development over the past year to maintain and improve our technology leadership and support our growth potential. I am very excited about our pipeline of new and recently released products that enhance our customers' productivity, but also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.This has been a topic of increasing importance for our customers as of late and our innovative solutions like LabX, enhanced productivity through workflow automation, while ensuring full data integrity and traceability across customer entire workload. Earlier this year, we launched a new thermal analysis instrument that allows customers to increase sample analysis throughput through new automation and software features. This is especially important in hot segments like advanced materials and the battery segment. Additionally, our Process Analytics business recently released a new conductivity sensor that is unmatched in the industry for measuring ultra-pure water in the microelectronics industry, helping increasing yields for our semiconductor customers, while reducing the amount of very expensive ultra-pure water required for their operations.Lastly, our Industrial business had great success with our new line of hygienic scales that help customers clean their scales up to 40% faster, but also help eliminate contamination risk in regulated environments like food and pharma. While individual new product launches are not material on their own, given the diversity of our portfolio, they provide a very important compounding element to our growth algorithm, expanding our technology leadership, enhancing our value propositions and helping drive market share gains. Going forward, we have a very exciting pipeline of innovative products that we plan to launch over the coming year that will further extend our leadership position. Turning now to our margin initiatives. Our pricing and SternDrive initiatives have been very effective in supporting our margin expansion this year.As a reminder, SternDrive is focused on improving productivity and driving operational excellence across our manufacturing and back-office operations, with our team executing several hundred projects to reduce material costs and improve productivity. We have excellent opportunities ahead of us with enhanced -- with advanced data-driven approaches around value engineering, smart manufacturing and common platform architectures that we expect to launch in the near future. I hope this provides some context to our updated guidance for the year, but also shows the confidence we have in our ability to continue to execute on our long-term growth initiatives, expand our margins and deliver solid earnings growth this year and beyond. Now that concludes -- that is the conclusion to our prepared remarks.Operator, I'd like to open the line now for questions.See also 12 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love and 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI Boom.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McDonald's, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in McDonald's. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 4.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$387m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best August Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the stock market, various strategies may gain popularity at different times, but investors consistently gravitate toward dividend stocks due to their ability to generate regular cash. As of the beginning of 2023, there has been a resurgence in the popularity and performance of tech stocks, while dividend stocks have been trailing behind in terms of investor interest and returns.Overall, the S&amp;P 500 experienced sluggish growth in dividend payments during the second quarter of 2023. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, 460 companies increased their dividends in Q2 2023, down 17.1% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that total dividend increases were $9.80 billion during this period, compared with $19.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsThe ongoing concerns over inflation and fears of a potential recession have prompted investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks. Historically, dividends have shown strong performance during economic downturns, making them more appealing among income investors. We recently reported Refinitiv Lipper’s data which highlighted that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received a significant boost with $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This surge represents the highest two-week increase for the ETF since January.To increase their cash flow, investors often prioritize companies with a history of strong dividend growth. By investing in such firms, investors can potentially benefit from both regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. According to a report by iShares, dividend growers outperformed dividend cutters and eliminators during both bull and bear markets from 1978 to 2021. These equities also recorded an overall strong performance than non-dividend payers during this period. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best dividend stocks to consider that have increased their dividends for decades.Story continuesDividend Capture Strategy:Within the broad category of dividend investing, various related strategies exist to help investors generate wealth. The dividend capture strategy is one of the known investment approaches where investors aim to profit from capturing dividend payments of specific stocks. The goal is to buy the stock just before the ex-dividend date, hold it long enough to receive the dividend, and then promptly sell it. By repeatedly executing this process with different dividend-paying stocks, investors can generate a stream of income from dividends.10 Best August Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list features the dividend capture strategy for selecting notable dividend stocks set to trade ex-dividend in August 2023.

Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry.

The names on the list weren't necessarily what you might think. While 2 of the ""Magnificent 7"" were on the list, that meant the others were not.The list reflected the last 23 years. That's a long time to hold, and compound, a stock. Compounding is usually associated with value investors, like Warren Buffett, because it's value investors which are normally long-term investors.But what about valuation? None of the Magnificent 7 are cheap.Should you buy a company at any price if you intend to hold it for a long time? Some on Twitter have argued that valuation is irrelevant. Look at Visa and Costco. Neither have been cheap but they have been good long-term performers.Does Valuation Matter in Long-Term Investing? 1.       Tractor Supply Co. TSCOInvestors might be surprised to see Tractor Supply as the third best performer in the S&amp;P 500 since 2000. Since Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Tractor Supply is up 18,980%.Story continuesEarnings of Tractor Supply are expected to rise 7% in 2023 and 10% in 2024. You're not getting the shares dirt cheap today, however, as it has a forward P/E of 20.5. And with that earnings growth, it has a PEG of 2.3.Should Tractor Supply still be on the value investor's shortlist?2.       Ansys Inc. ANSSAnsys is a software company that specializes in engineering simulation. Ansys didn't join the S&amp;P 500 until 2017 but it is now the 8th best performing S&amp;P 500 stock since 2000. From Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Ansys is up 13,162%.Earnings of Ansys are expected to rise 7.6% in 2023 and 11.6% in 2024. But you'll pay a high price for those earnings as it has a forward P/E of 40 and a PEG ratio of 8.Is it too late for value investors to get into Ansys?3.       Visa Inc. VVisa did not make the S&amp;P 500 best performers list. It went IPO in 2008 and shares are up 1,363% during that time.Earnings of Visa are expected to jump 15.2% in fiscal 2023 and another 12.8% in fiscal 2024. Shares have always been expensive. At the IPO, it was trading at 40x and in 2021, when shares hit new highs, it was trading at 51x. But it's gotten cheaper. Visa currently trades with a forward P/E of 27 and a PEG of 1.8.Should value investors keep an eye on Visa?4.       Costco Wholesale Corp. COSTCostco didn't make the S&amp;P 500 best performers list either, even though it's a fan favorite both of shoppers and investors. Shares of Costco are up 1,052% from Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023.Earnings of Costco are expected to rise 9.7% in fiscal 2023 and another 6.9% in fiscal 2024. But is that good enough? Costco is expensive, with a forward P/E of 39.2 and a PEG ratio of 4.7.For value investors, is it time to concede you will never own Costco?5.       Chipotle Mexican Grill CMGChipotle Mexican Grill also did not make the list of the top 10 best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks. It went IPO in Jan 2006 and promptly rose 100% on its first day of trading. Chipotle hasn't been a cheap stock since. Shares of Chipotle are up 4,404% since the IPO.Earnings of Chipotle are expected to soar 34.5% in 2023 and rise another 20% in 2024. Shares have come down off recent all-time highs so its PEG ratio is just 1.3. That looks more attractive than its forward P/E, which is 42.7.If Chipotle shares weaken further, will value investors take a look?What Else Do You Need to Know About Long-Term Investing and Compounding?

So what exactly is a biotech stock? It’s a company that’s somehow involved in the creation of innovative drugs. This can be through research, development, or production. This sector saw a huge pandemic-related boost when the mRNA technology that many of them specialize in was thrust into the spotlight. The biotech industry is underpinned by some pretty undeniable growth trends. First and foremost is the aging global population. A more senior population brings higher health risks, which means the discovery and distribution of new drugs to combat long-term illnesses and improve quality of life are of the utmost importance. Once the therapies have been created, biotech firms invest heavily in making sure they’re protected by a patent to limit competition and increase market share and profitability.The drug industry sees a great deal of merger and acquisition activity. Larger companies frequently swallow up smaller ones with success in a specialized, specific therapy in order to grow their portfolios. As a result, undervalued biotech stocks have a strong appeal for investors looking to maximize their capital. These are three biotech stocks that I think are both undervalued and worth considering for investors due to their promising project pipelines.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntellia (NTLA)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comIntellia (NASDAQ:NTLA) is one of the highest risk picks on this risk because the company doesn’t have any treatments on the market, but this uncertainty also makes it one of the most undervalued biotech stocks. The group’s partnered with Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) on a treatment for a rare genetic heart disease. So far, clinical trial results have been promising, though it’s important to remember the process is long and arduous. There are no guarantees. The potential treatment itself is appealing, but it’s the underlying technology that makes Intellia look like one of the best biotech stocks to buy.  The group uses CRISPR technology, which is basically slicing up and correcting DNA in order to treat genetic diseases. The applications for this type of treatment are far-reaching and could be groundbreaking for condition that currently lack viable treatment options. This suggests that Intellia could really take-off after gaining experience moving treatments from pipeline to shelf, whether on its own or as a takeover target for big-name acquisition. Story continuesModerna (MRNA)red text reads ""moderna"" on a light blue background. there is a bottle of liquid vaccine next to a medical needleSource: diy13 / ShutterstockModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is best known for its role in developing a Covid-19 vaccine, but it’s also a strong pick among undervalued biotech stocks as it moves on from the pandemic. Moderna was able to quickly ramp up its vaccine candidate thanks to its expertise with mRNA technology. Now, the group’s looking to use its mRNA platform as a springboard for new growth opportunities. Moderna says it can deliver solutions to all kinds of diseases, from influenza to cancer, via mRNA. It says the method is a faster and more efficient way to develop and launch medicine. If Moderna is able to pivot its business toward other diseases using the same principle, the growth potential could be enormous. Of course this kind of pivot comes with a great deal of spending and no guarantee of a return. But the idea is promising and makes Moderna a strong pick among biotech stocks. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Various medical equipment is on top of a page with information about cystic fibrosis.Source: ShutterstockIt may be surprising to see Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) on a list of undervalued biotech stocks given its share price is up almost 30% so far this year. But the group is at the start of what looks like a very promising growth trajectory, so the optimism is well deserved.Vertex’s bread and butter is Cystic Fibrosis drugs. The group’s carved out a strong position as a leader in the market here, and is expecting to remain top dog through at least the late 2030s. The existing treatments plus some up-and-coming potential blockbusters offer even further confidence to investors. But Vertex isn’t resting on its laurels as a leader in Cystic Fibrosis. The company’s now looking at ways to push its portfolio into new corners of the market. One of the most exciting ventures is its CRISPR gene editing program. Vertex is looking to put the technology to work on type 1 diabetes, which could be a game changer for this group of patients.  On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global spirits market, the rise of spirit RTDs, the new popular RTD in the market, and the success of celebrity-owned spirits, and go directly to 10 Most Popular Spirits in the World. Any alcoholic liquid that has been distilled after going through fermentation is referred to as a ‘spirit’. Alcohol is produced when yeast breaks down sugar into ethanol through the fermentation process. The produced alcohol is then removed from water and other impurities in the fermented liquid through the distillation process. Spirits are often more costly than other alcoholic beverages like beer and wine because of the said distillation process. Among the many distilled liquors available, there are just six base spirits – rum, gin, brandy, tequila, whiskey, and vodka. The Spirits Market: The spirits industry is overcoming economic headwinds to meet changing consumer preferences as it chips away at the dominance of beer. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the spirits revenue market share grew from 28.7% in 2000 to 42.1% in 2022, while beer held a 41.9% market share last year. Thus, the spirits industry surpassed beer in revenue for the first time ever. According to Future Market Insights, the global spirits market is estimated to be at $59.4 billion in 2023, and is expected to be worth around $90.29 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.27% during the forecast period. The rising popularity of premium alcoholic drinks and RTDs owing to higher consumer spending could be one of the key factors for the rapid development of the spirits industry. The Rise of Spirit RTDs: Ready-to-drink beverages continue to make headlines as the fastest-growing alcohol beverage category. While malt-based RTDs still retain a 91% share by volume in the American RTD market, spirit-based RTDs grew by 51% in 2021, approximately double the growth of the wine-and malt-based categories. According to IWSR, the spirits-based RTDs are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% in volume in the U.S. by 2025. Story continuesAs consumers continue to look for ‘healthier’ alcohol options, spirit RTDs are responding with spirit-based seltzers with natural flavors and fewer calories. Spirit RTDs like Owl’s Brew’s Tea-based Seltzers claim to be alcoholic drinks that are good for health, benefiting from the ‘health halo’ created by ingredients like vitamins, anti-oxidants, and probiotics. New RTD in the Market: Although a good ol’ Jack &amp; Coke has been a quintessential serve at every bar for a long time, the much-loved cocktail is now also available in the form of a pre-mixed, canned RTD – courtesy of a joint venture between the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD made its U.S. debut in March this year in 12-oz. cans (7% ABV), and Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also became available in May. Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) took a test-and learn-approach for the initial launch, applying lessons from a single-country rollout in Mexico to a global scaling strategy, bringing the product to 13 countries in 12 months. Both the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) rank among the Largest Beverage Companies in the World in 2023. The Success of Celebrity-owned Spirits: A growing number of celebrities are investing their time and money in the spirits business by backing brands, getting involved with distillation, deciding on flavor profiles or forging partnerships within the industry. These ventures have often proven quite lucrative. In 2017, George Clooney and his co-owners sold their tequila brand Casamigos to Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in a cash out that also motivated others to get in on the action. Ryan Reynolds also became a co-owner of the Oregon-based Aviation American Gin in 2018 and after some genius and chuckle-inducing marketing skits by the Hollywood actor, the brand was eventually acquired by Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) for $610 million in 2020. Similarly, Jay-Z also sold the majority stake in D’USSÉ – his best-selling cognac brand – to Bacardi this year, in a deal worth approximately $750 million. The beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) also recently announced the launch of its own whisky and vodka brands in India in partnership with Aryan Khan, son of the Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan. With that said, here are the most popular spirit brands in the world. 25 Most Popular Spirits in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to The Brand Champions 2023 magazine of The Spirits Business, looking for the Most Popular Spirit Brands, and ranked them according to the sales volume of their 9-liter cases in 2022.If you’d like to find out which brands are in demand these days in the gin market, please refer to 20 Most Popular Gin Brands in 2023. 25 Most Popular Spirits in the World25.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.Andy Taylor: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. As forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.Devin Stockfish: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $230 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $238 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $469 million in the second quarter. This is a 19% increase from the first quarter and was largely driven by an increase in wood products commodity pricing and strong EWP sales volumes. Notwithstanding elevated mortgage rates, we've been encouraged by resilient demand for new homes this year, which provided a nice tailwind for our Wood Products business in the second quarter. We delivered solid results in the quarter, and I'd like to thank our teams for their collective efforts and focus on safety, operational excellence, and continuing to serve our customers.Story continuesBefore moving into our business results, I'd like to comment briefly on a Timberlands transaction we completed earlier this month. As we reported yesterday, we acquired 22,000 acres of high quality Timberlands in Mississippi for approximately $60 million. This acquisition is comprised of highly productive timberlands strategically located to deliver immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser timber and mill operations. With a mature age class and well stock timber inventory, we expect these timberlands to generate strong cash yields. Additionally, the acquisition offers incremental real estate and natural climate solution opportunities in the future. This transaction is a great example of our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio with high quality, well managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders.As highlighted on Page 22 of our earnings slides, we continue to make great progress against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $360 million against this target, including the recent Mississippi transaction and the acquisitions in the Carolinas and Washington, which were completed in 2022. Turning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $104 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a $16 million decrease compared to the first quarter. This was largely driven by lower average sales realizations for export logs in the west.Turning to the western domestic market. Favorable weather conditions during the quarter supported increased log supply across the region. Log demand improved as mills returned to more normalized operating levels in response to strengthening lumber prices and later in the quarter, took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories ahead of wildfire season. These dynamics kept log prices fairly stable during the second quarter. And as a result, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the first quarter as a result of favorable operating conditions. Domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we intentionally shifted logs to the domestic customers to capture higher margin opportunities.Per unit log and haul costs improved in the second quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Moving to our Western Export business. In Japan, log markets continued to soften in the second quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were lower compared to the first quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. As we look forward, we expect European lumber inventories in Japan to normalize in the coming months, which should increase demand for our Douglas Spur logs into the Japanese market later in the year. In China, log markets softened in the second quarter in response to an influx of log supply from New Zealand combined with the reduction in log takeaway at the ports.As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were lower compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market. Turning to the south. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $79 million, a slight reduction compared to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improved with drier conditions and mills bolstered log inventories following weather-related challenges in the first quarter. In contrast, Southern fiber markets softened in response to elevated inventories of logs and finished goods at mills as well as lower overall demand for pulp and paper end market, in products. Given favorable operating conditions, our thinning activity increased in the second quarter, resulting in a higher mix of fiber locks.As a result, our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter, and our fee harvest volumes were comparable. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower, primarily due to lower fuel prices and forestry and road costs were seasonably higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $52 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, a $19 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly in the second quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels.We continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in May. In the second quarter, we completed the third-party audit process and submitted the project to the American Carbon Registry for final approval. Once approved, we expect an initial issuance of approximately 30,000 credits in year one, and we're currently developing two additional projects in the U.S. South. We remain focused on positioning our credits to capture the highest value possible in the marketplace. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $218 million of earnings in the second quarter and $270 million of adjusted EBITDA.Second quarter EBITDA was an 82% improvement from the first quarter largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB sales realizations and strong sales volumes for engineered wood products. Starting with lumber. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, a $43 million increase over the prior quarter and largely driven by improved sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for lumber held fairly stable in April and May as sentiment remained cautious. Buyers mostly limited orders to necessity purchases despite lean inventories. By mid-June, overall sentiment and benchmark pricing improved in response to stronger housing activity, perceived risks to supply from Canadian wildfires and announced mill curtailments also bolstered buying activity in June.For the quarter, the framing lumber composite was comparable to the first quarter while our average sales realizations increased by 6% with the relative outperformance driven by our regional mix and product mix. Our sales volumes were moderately higher compared to the first quarter as our Northwest mills returned to more normalized operating levels. Log costs were slightly lower, primarily for Western logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $15 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing, slightly offset by higher unit manufacturing costs related to planned and unplanned downtime. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the second quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by lean inventories and steady demand from new home construction activity.As the quarter progressed, buyer sentiment and benchmark pricing continued to improve as Canadian wildfires disrupted supply and in response to improving residential construction activity. As a result, the OSB composite pricing increased by 21% compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 11%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes were moderately lower in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance and a temporary period of unplanned downtime related to wildfire activity near one of our facilities in Alberta. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter.Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $62 million or 76% compared to the first quarter. This result is directly tied to improving demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. As a result, our production and sales volumes were significantly higher for most products in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved significantly for solid section and I-joist products. That said, our average sales realizations were lower for most products as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Raw material costs decreased for all products in the second quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million compared to the first quarter, a 55% improvement as the business benefited from strong EWP sales volumes in the second quarter.With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.fotoknips/Shutterstock.comDavid Wold: Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $496 million of cash from operations in the second quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.8 billion. In May, we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and issued $750 million of debt due in 2026 and at a coupon of 4.75%. This debt issuance prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. And due to the shape of the yield curve, we were able to reinvest these cash proceeds in the interim at interest rates in excess of the bond coupon.As a result of this transaction, our full-year 2023 interest expense will increase by $10 million to approximately $280 million. That said, this increase will be more than offset by the interest income earned on the invested issuance proceeds. In mid-July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay our $118 million, 78% note at maturity, and we intend to use the remainder of issuance proceeds towards our December 2023 maturity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased in the first quarter by 5.6% to $0.19 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter.These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.59 and as of quarter, our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $415 million, and we have generated $470 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations.Domestic log demand was steady at the outset of the third quarter in response to improved pricing and a way of lumber and as mills continue to build inventories ahead of wildfire season. That said, absent fire-related disruptions in the region, log supply is expected to remain ample as the quarter progresses, largely driven by a seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. As is typical during the warmer and dryer months, we have transitioned in the higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity. As a result, our fee harvest volumes will be moderately lower in the third quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher as we do a significant amount of this work during the summer months and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower, partly due to a decrease in fuel prices.Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, we anticipate our Japanese sales volumes will increase compared to the second quarter due to the timing of vessels, and we expect our sales realizations to be comparable. In China, elevated log imports from New Zealand and reduced log consumption continued to have an impact on the Chinese log market. We expect these conditions to persist through the third quarter. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we flex logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities.In the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter and fiber markets to soften further. This is being driven by a seasonal increase in log supply, elevated mill inventories and softening demand, particularly for pulp and paper products. That said, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and will include a higher mix of fiber logs as increased spinning activity continues. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher.In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remain steady, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be slightly higher and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full-year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment and now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.For our Wood Products segment, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand relatively lean inventories and the prospects of supply disruptions following an early start to wildfire season in Canada. As shown on Page 21, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are well above the second quarter averages. Assuming this pricing dynamic remains intact for the balance of the third quarter, we expect our Wood Products financial results to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2023. That said, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than last quarter.For our Lumber business, we expect moderately higher production and sales volumes in the third quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we expect production and sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher and fiber costs are expected to be comparable. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we continue to see improving demand for EWP products, and this has extended our order activity well into the third quarter. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to increase slightly compared to the second quarter. Notwithstanding this dynamic, we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets.That said, third quarter EWP prices are expected to remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to adjust in response to demand signals from the homebuilding segment, which has seen more strength of late, particularly for single-family construction. Raw material costs are expected to be higher compared to the second quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.Devin Stockfish: Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market has become incrementally more positive over the last several months, supported by improvements in homebuilder sentiment and increase in new home sales and an uptick in single-family starts. Despite elevated mortgage rates, we continue to see resilient demand from the homebuilding segment largely driven by the historically low inventory of existing homes, a strong labor market and solid household balance sheets. That being said, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty around the trajectory of mortgage rates in the broader U.S. economy. As a result, we still expect to sign starts in 2023 to be lower than the last couple of years.But again, our outlook has become more positive as the year has progressed, and there may be incremental upside if mortgage rates move down from the high 6% range. And longer-term, we remain quite optimistic on housing fundamentals supported by favorable demographic trends and significantly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity strengthened slightly in the second quarter and has held up well year-to-date, largely supported by solid demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment was steady in the second quarter and is largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Near-term, we expect stable demand from this segment as prospective homebuyers may choose to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment.And longer-term, we continue to believe the repair and remodel market will be an important demand driver for our businesses, supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock. In closing, our teams delivered solid operational and financial results in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress against the multi-year targets we set out in 2021 through strategic Timberlands acquisitions and the advancement of our Forest Carbon business. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by recent improvements in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. We remain focused on operational excellence and innovation, driving industry leading margins and supporting our customers.And with our strong financial position, our unmatched portfolio of assets and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions.See also 10 Stock Market Forecasts Next 6 Months and 10 Best Regional Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Waste Management How Fast Is Waste Management Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Waste Management grew its EPS by 14% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Waste Management remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 5.2% to US$20b.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Waste Management's forecast profits?Are Waste Management Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Waste Management, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$131m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Waste Management but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesIs Waste Management Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Waste Management is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Dennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued the news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hopper. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.Story continuesNow, I'll turn over the call to Steve.Steve Johnston: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2023 was quite a change from the net loss of more than $800 million for last year's second quarter. As we've noted in the past, large income swings can occur as gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value. And this year, we recognized a significant investment gain. We believe the value of our equity portfolio will continue to grow over the long term. As of June 30, it had $6.1 billion in appreciated value, increasing 8% since the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income of $191 million for the quarter more than doubled the $94 million from a year ago despite catastrophe losses that were $11 million higher on an after-tax basis.Our 97.6% second quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 5.6 percentage points better than last year's second quarter, including a decrease of 0.4 points for catastrophe losses. The 90.4% ex-cat accident year combined ratio for the second quarter was 2.4 percentage points better than the same period a year ago and is another important indicator of improved performance. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and ongoing elevated inflation effects, we continue to see reasons for confidence about performance for the second half of the year. Pricing continued to accelerate during the second quarter of this year and we also worked to address inflation in other ways, such as changing factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs.We reported improved underwriting performance ratios in just about every major line of business compared with the first quarter of this year. On a current accident year basis, measured at June 30 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 and consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.5 percentage points on a case incurred basis which included 0.6 point improvement on a paid basis. For the same period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 4.7 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. Similar to the first quarter, we earned a small underwriting profit for our commercial umbrella line in the second quarter.In our commercial casualty line of business in total had an estimated combined ratio of approximately 90%. Our underwriters continue to do an excellent job in risk selection and pricing Importantly, Asians appointed by Cincinnati Insurance continue to produce profitable business for us in an outstanding fashion. Underwriters emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were higher than the first quarter for each of our major lines of business. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range.Personal Lines for the second quarter included auto in the high single-digit range and homeowner in the mid-single-digit range. In terms of net written premiums, consolidated property casualty growth was 9% for the second quarter of 2023. That included an 11% increase in second quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insurance exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Next, I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. Commercial Lines grew second quarter 2023 net written premiums 3%, reflecting discipline, particularly for commercial umbrella risks. Its combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points better than a year ago, including 1.5 points from lower catastrophe losses.We see the second quarter 10% reduction in new business written premiums as an expected result of pricing and underwriting discipline. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 23%, with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for the high net worth clients and our agencies. Its combined ratio was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago despite an increase of 0.6 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 92.2% and net written premiums grew 16%. Its combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 9.9 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continued to enhance our profitability. Cincinnati Re had a strong 73.7% combined ratio for the second quarter of 2023.Pixabay/Public DomainIts net written premiums essentially matched last year's second quarter, while casualty premiums decreased as a result of fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market, property net written premiums increased by 27% and largely due to a combination of higher pricing and market opportunities. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 88.3% with net written premiums continuing strong growth at 19%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to report excellent results in the second quarter with net income up 91% from last year in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. As I usually do, I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our second quarter 2023 VCR was 4.0%, another strong result.Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.8%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 2.2%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other important factors about our financial performance.Mike Sewell: Thank you, Steve and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued at a strong pace of 13% for the second quarter of 2023 versus last year's second quarter. As expected, dividend income decreased 3% for the quarter due to 2 items we touched on last quarter. First, we are seeing dividend rates increase more slowly. Second, in last year's second quarter, we received a $5 million special dividend from 1 of our stockholdings that didn't repeat this year. Net equity security purchases for the first half of 2023 totaled $93 million. Bond interest income rose 19% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with the net purchases totaling $732 million for the first 6 months of the year.The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.34% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 34 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2023 was 5.88%. Valuation changes in aggregate for our equity portfolio during the second quarter of 2023 were favorable but were unfavorable for the bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain for the equity portfolio was $459 million, while the net loss for the bond portfolio was $158 million. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.1 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $838 million.Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth in addition to rising bond yields boosting interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2023 was $825 million, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to emphasize expense management with a balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year as premium growth outpaced growth in total expenses. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.For the first half of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $452 million, including $358 million for the IBNR portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $101 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.5 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2023 included: favorable $99 million for 2022; unfavorable $5 million for 2021; favorable $49 million for 2020 and a favorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. Regarding capital management, our approach remains consistent as we pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans.We still believe our financial flexibility is outstanding and that our financial strength is in excellent shape. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 398,000 shares at an average price per share of $104.48. We also paid $117 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.15. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.86. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $0.81.Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.31 and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2 per share during the second quarter to $7.33 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.Steve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. We are in the challenging insurance market and I'm proud of the way our associates are navigating it. We believe we are taking the necessary actions to continue delivering profitable growth through all insurance cycles. In the last month, to third-party organizations agreed. S&amp;P affirmed our high financial strength ratings and we were also again included on the 50 list, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 32 times to the Property Casualty Awards 50 since the analysis began in 1991. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for General Electric The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.86bUS$7.09bUS$8.35bUS$8.88bUS$9.29bUS$9.65bUS$9.98bUS$10.3bUS$10.6bUS$10.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.34%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$5.4kUS$6.0kUS$6.6kUS$6.4kUS$6.2kUS$5.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.1kUS$4.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$58bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$175bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$175b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$78bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$135b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$114, the company appears about fair value at a 8.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.063. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General ElectricStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Industrials market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For General Electric, we've compiled three additional items you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for General Electric (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does GE's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.3bUS$16.8bUS$17.7bUS$18.5bUS$19.2bUS$19.8bUS$20.4bUS$20.9bUS$21.4bUS$21.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$14.3kUS$14.7kUS$14.5kUS$14.2kUS$13.8kUS$13.3kUS$12.8kUS$12.3kUS$11.8kUS$11.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$133bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$471bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$471b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$243bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$376b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$156, the company appears about fair value at a 1.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Procter &amp; GambleStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Over the years, dividend stocks demonstrated their ability to outperform the broader market on several occasions. This makes them an attractive choice for investors seeking both income and potential long-term growth. Moreover, dividend stocks have represented a significant portion of overall market returns. We also reported Hartford Fund’s data which revealed that dividends have accounted for approximately 41% of the index's total return on average from 1930 to 2022.Though investors favored tech growth stocks in early 2023, analysts believe that dividend stocks may make a comeback due to the potential for a mild recession. On July 18, Bank of America released a global fund manager survey indicating that sentiment has turned more bearish. The majority consensus is now leaning towards a mild recession in the last quarter of 2023. The main concerns cited by respondents include potential risks related to inflation, policy mistakes, and a credit crunch. To navigate this bearish sentiment, analysts advise adding dividend-paying stocks to portfolios as these stocks historically perform better during economic downturns compared to non-dividend ones.Dividend stocks are not completely recession-proof, but they tend to be more stable compared to high-growth or speculative stocks when the economy is going through a downturn. Last year’s bear market also showed a strong outperformance of dividend stocks in comparison with other asset classes. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index declined by 6.47% in 2022, whereas the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst performance since 2008, falling by over 19%. Investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their dividends for long periods of time rather than those with high yields. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their continuous commitment to shareholders for decades.Story continuesAlso read: 11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyWhen speaking about economic downturns, these periods can negatively impact investor confidence, leading to widespread selling across various stocks and causing some to become oversold.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for D.R. Horton, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$6.4b ÷ (US$32b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceIn the above chart we have measured D.R. Horton's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is D.R. Horton's ROCE Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at D.R. Horton. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 24%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 124%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.What We Can Learn From D.R. Horton's ROCETo sum it up, D.R. Horton has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 209% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if D.R. Horton can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for D.R.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best August Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the stock market, various strategies may gain popularity at different times, but investors consistently gravitate toward dividend stocks due to their ability to generate regular cash. As of the beginning of 2023, there has been a resurgence in the popularity and performance of tech stocks, while dividend stocks have been trailing behind in terms of investor interest and returns.Overall, the S&amp;P 500 experienced sluggish growth in dividend payments during the second quarter of 2023. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, 460 companies increased their dividends in Q2 2023, down 17.1% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that total dividend increases were $9.80 billion during this period, compared with $19.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsThe ongoing concerns over inflation and fears of a potential recession have prompted investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks. Historically, dividends have shown strong performance during economic downturns, making them more appealing among income investors. We recently reported Refinitiv Lipper’s data which highlighted that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received a significant boost with $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This surge represents the highest two-week increase for the ETF since January.To increase their cash flow, investors often prioritize companies with a history of strong dividend growth. By investing in such firms, investors can potentially benefit from both regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. According to a report by iShares, dividend growers outperformed dividend cutters and eliminators during both bull and bear markets from 1978 to 2021. These equities also recorded an overall strong performance than non-dividend payers during this period. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best dividend stocks to consider that have increased their dividends for decades.Story continuesDividend Capture Strategy:Within the broad category of dividend investing, various related strategies exist to help investors generate wealth. The dividend capture strategy is one of the known investment approaches where investors aim to profit from capturing dividend payments of specific stocks. The goal is to buy the stock just before the ex-dividend date, hold it long enough to receive the dividend, and then promptly sell it. By repeatedly executing this process with different dividend-paying stocks, investors can generate a stream of income from dividends.10 Best August Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list features the dividend capture strategy for selecting notable dividend stocks set to trade ex-dividend in August 2023. The ex-dividend date signifies the last day to purchase a stock and be eligible for its upcoming dividend payment.

Over the years, dividend stocks demonstrated their ability to outperform the broader market on several occasions. This makes them an attractive choice for investors seeking both income and potential long-term growth. Moreover, dividend stocks have represented a significant portion of overall market returns. We also reported Hartford Fund’s data which revealed that dividends have accounted for approximately 41% of the index's total return on average from 1930 to 2022.Though investors favored tech growth stocks in early 2023, analysts believe that dividend stocks may make a comeback due to the potential for a mild recession. On July 18, Bank of America released a global fund manager survey indicating that sentiment has turned more bearish. The majority consensus is now leaning towards a mild recession in the last quarter of 2023. The main concerns cited by respondents include potential risks related to inflation, policy mistakes, and a credit crunch. To navigate this bearish sentiment, analysts advise adding dividend-paying stocks to portfolios as these stocks historically perform better during economic downturns compared to non-dividend ones.Dividend stocks are not completely recession-proof, but they tend to be more stable compared to high-growth or speculative stocks when the economy is going through a downturn. Last year’s bear market also showed a strong outperformance of dividend stocks in comparison with other asset classes. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index declined by 6.47% in 2022, whereas the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst performance since 2008, falling by over 19%. Investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their dividends for long periods of time rather than those with high yields.

Quest will then arrange for an appointment with a telemedicine doctor to order it on their behalf. If the test is positive, individuals will be contacted by a doctor from an independent physician network to discuss the next steps and potentially can share the results with other physicians, the company said.Quest's lab-developed test, created and performed in a single laboratory, has not undergone any FDA review. The agency generally does not review such tests as long as they are prescribed by a healthcare provider. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Richard Chang)]"

(PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)Quest launches the novel innovation amid a rapidly changing landscape for Alzheimer's disease care, featuring new and emerging therapies, growing recognition that non-pharmacological interventions can reduce Alzheimer's disease risk, and greater medical acceptance of blood tests to aid early Alzheimer's disease detection.AD-Detect is a screening test that uses plasma, the liquid component of blood, from a single blood draw to evaluate levels of amyloid beta proteins to help detect early signs associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta proteins are known to accumulate and form plaques in the brain, which are linked to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. AD-Detect evaluates the ratio of two peptides of amyloid beta, Aβ42 and Aβ40, in plasma.The new consumer-initiated test utilizes the same expertise and technology as Quest's clinical AD-Detect Amyloid Beta 42/40 Ratio test, an analytically validated blood test that aids in assessing the risk of Alzheimer's diseasei,ii, which the company launched for physician ordering in early 2022. By making the innovation available through Quest's consumer-initiated testing platform, questhealth.com, people can purchase AD-Detect without the need to visit a doctor first, giving them greater agency over the decision on when and how to assess their cognitive health. The test offering also ensures individuals have access to a continuum of care, with an independent physician network providing clinical oversight of test ordering and results delivery. Individuals can discuss results with a licensed physician to help them understand what their results may mean and to determine an action plan for continued care, including whether a follow-up with their physician or a specialist may be appropriate.Story continues""We are seeing much attention on emerging therapies for Alzheimer's disease, but with new treatment options will come the need to make screening and diagnosis more widely available. Blood tests like AD-Detect hold incredible potential to make Alzheimer's disease risk assessment both accessible and convenient,"" said Michael K. Racke, M.D., Medical Director of Neurology, Quest Diagnostics. ""We're also seeing a push from consumers who have a desire to take more control of their health, including within more advanced areas like Alzheimer's disease risk assessment.""Consumers have expressed a desire to take a more proactive approach to Alzheimer's disease screening and a willingness to explore earlier diagnosis, particularly if it can connect them to earlier treatment options. A recent research reportiii from Quest Diagnostics based on a Harris Poll survey found that adult Americans want to be evaluated for dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, nearly 10 years earlier than current medical practiceiv – even despite fear of a diagnosis. The vast majority (86%) also believe blood tests for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease risk will increasingly become a regular part of preventative care.Detection of Alzheimer's disease has traditionally involved screening individuals for symptoms of cognitive impairment, such as forgetfulness, followed by invasive and expensive tests, such as PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, to confirm a diagnosis. Interventions to stall or potentially mitigate Alzheimer's disease, including behavioral changes (such as exercising more) or use of emerging Alzheimer's disease therapies, may be most effective when initiated in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.The new test from Quest may be appropriate for individuals who believe they are experiencing cognitive decline or if an individual's loved one recognizes potential signs of mild cognitive impairment, such as memory loss, as well as those with family history of Alzheimer's disease – even if they are not exhibiting symptoms, are 65 years of age or older, or have had brain trauma or head injury. Blood tests like AD-Detect can help provide insights on potential risk of Alzheimer's disease and help individuals facilitate necessary discussions with their doctors.Individuals who purchase a test online and have the test ordered by the independent physician network will be prompted to schedule an appointment at one of 2,100 Quest Diagnostics patient service centers for a blood draw. Test results are made available on a secure patient portal and delivered in a clear, easy-to-read report.Licensed physicians provide oversight for all tests based upon the information that individuals provide to Quest. This includes test ordering and evaluating results once available. With AD-Detect, individuals can also discuss their results with a licensed physician through the independent physician network that orders the test. In addition, they can share results with other doctors, such as their regular primary care physician, providing multiple ways to connect with a healthcare provider who can help determine interventions and a management plan that is most beneficial to each individual.More than 6 million Americansv have Alzheimer's, the most prevalent dementia, a number projected to reach 14 millionvi by 2060. With blood tests comes the potential to identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease even before symptoms manifest. A growing body of research suggests lifestyle and environmental factors, from physical activity to social interactions, can contribute to Alzheimer's disease.viiQuest Diagnostics has long-standing history of advancing science in the field of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Through its Advanced™ Neurology and Athena Diagnostics business, Quest provides an industry-leading menu of laboratory tests for evaluating dementias, including Alzheimer's disease. It pioneered the first AB 42/40 test for use in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the basis for its AD-Detect 42/40 blood test. It also provides a range of testing services to help evaluate ApoE status and the tau protein. With the introduction of AD-Detect to its consumer-initiated testing business, Quest is pioneering a new path in Alzheimer's disease risk assessment through a consumer-powered channel that offers access to healthcare providers who can help guide people to understand their results and develop a care plan.AD-Detect is now available for purchase to adults (ages 18+) in the United States** on questhealth.com.For more information, visit questhealth.com and follow @testwithquest on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. *The AD-Detect Test for Alzheimer's Disease available through Quest's consumer-initiated testing platform is a screening test to help identify potential risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. It is not a diagnostic test. Only a physician or healthcare professional can provide an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, and the risk of having Alzheimer's disease as the underlying cause for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia should be considered in conjunction with the findings from medical and family history, physicals, nutritional deficiency biomarkers, neurological and neuropsychological examinations, and neuroimaging. Individuals may seek to confer with a physician to understand their results and whether additional testing and assessment is right for them.**Excludes AK, AZ, and HI About Quest Quest, through questhealth.com, empowers consumers by making affordable, high-quality, trusted healthcare easy.
