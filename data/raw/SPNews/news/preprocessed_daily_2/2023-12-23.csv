The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Nucor's shares before the 28th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.54 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.04 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Nucor has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current share price of $178.06. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Nucor ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Nucor is paying out just 10% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Nucor generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 8.5% of its free cash flow last year.', ""It's positive to see that Nucor's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Nucor has grown its earnings rapidly, up 38% a year for the past five years. Nucor looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Nucor has lifted its dividend by approximately 3.9% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Nucor is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""Is Nucor worth buying for its dividend? We love that Nucor is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Nucor looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Nucor (including 1 which can't be ignored)."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Nucor is expected to post earnings of $2.93 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -40.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.9%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $17.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -38.2%.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $7.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.5%.

The EPS surprise was +7.28%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

He has gained an ardent fan following over the past few decades through his stock recommendations to viewers. Recently, the journalist investor has been outlining his thoughts on recession fears, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the policies of the US government on mergers and acquisitions. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who returned more than 20% to investors annually for more than ten years.\xa0', 'On December 13, Cramer lauded the decision of the central bank to keep interest rates steady for the next few months, describing it as a win for the bulls at the stock market. Cramer was of the view that the Fed had already achieved a soft landing for the US economy, predicting that many sectors would soar as the pace of growth picked up once again. Cramer stressed that even though interest rates might start coming down, investors could still make money from cyclical sectors with the right strategy.\xa0', '“Sure, the easy money has been made in a couple of sectors — mostly tech — but now it’s time for a bunch of other sectors to shine, the economically sensitive ones that were supposed to be crushed by an inevitable recession. These stocks aren’t liked. May I suggest you cotton to them because the plane has landed, our seatbelts are unbuckled, we’re going down the gangway, calling an Uber and getting the heck out of the airport.”', 'Cramer has also recently criticized the Federal Trade Commission for hurting stock portfolios by limiting merger and acquisition activity. On December 18, he described Lina Khan, the chief of the FTC, as a one-woman wrecking crew for stock portfolios. Cramer warned that by not letting smaller firms merge with big ones, the bigger firm would end up being hurt and the smaller one might go bankrupt. Cramer noted that merger and acquisition activity at the stock market actually created healthier competition overall.\xa0', '“Lina Khan wants to stop corporate consolidation, yet she’s created a situation where only the largest, wealthiest companies can afford all the litigation that now comes with making acquisitions.”', 'Some of the recent additions to the Jim Cramer stock portfolio include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). Cramer has been especially bullish on firms like Alphabet because of the AI growth catalysts on offer. He recently said, “Generative artificial intelligence can pretty much do whatever it wants, anything we want it to, and if we don’t ask it, another enterprise will and that competitor will get the answer faster and better than we can arrive at it, which is why everybody is ordering all this stuff”.', 'Our Methodology', 'The stocks on which Jim Cramer has recently been bullish on were selected for the list. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023.

Due to supply chain issues, bloated inventories, inflationary pressures, and weaker demand, the Company badly missed its original 2022 guidance. With recessionary fears, waning earnings momentum, a more elevated leverage profile, and reliance on the U.S. construction market, it is of no surprise how poorly the stock price behaved last year.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'As you can see below, Microchip Technology had US$6.08b of debt at September 2023, down from US$7.30b a year prior. However, it does have US$256.6m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$5.82b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Microchip Technology had liabilities of US$3.41b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$6.22b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$256.6m in cash and US$1.71b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$7.67b.', 'Of course, Microchip Technology has a titanic market capitalization of US$48.8b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Microchip Technology's net debt is only 1.3 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 18.3 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On top of that, Microchip Technology grew its EBIT by 37% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Microchip Technology can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Microchip Technology actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces."", ""Microchip Technology's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Microchip Technology is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So the balance sheet looks pretty healthy, to us.

The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns.

The deal fell apart after US natural gas prices collapsed to $2 per million Btu from a summer 2022 peak around $9/MMBtu.', '""For a variety of reasons the deal between these two parties made a lot of sense. The main thing that changed was the value of the transaction, which was effectively recalibrated at the sustained lower gas price, compared to the much higher gas price at the time of the January announcement,"" Energy Advisors Group partner Adrian Goodisman told Energy Intelligence on Monday.', ""TGNR\xa0 has been active in the Haynesville after acquiring\xa0Shell Plc's (NYSE:SHEL) assets in the Texas/Louisiana play in 2019. Haynesville has seen little M&A action over the past two years amid volatile gas prices."", 'Brookfield To Sell Renewable Assets', ""Canada's\xa0Brookfield Corp.\xa0(BN.TO)\xa0has announced plans to sell renewable assets owned by its company\xa0Saeta Yield\xa0worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.64 billion) including debt.\xa0The assets to be sold are wind and photovoltaic plants located in Spain and Portugal. Saeta owns 28 wind farms and 10 photovoltaic parks; however, its seven solar thermal plants are not part of the sale process."", 'Spain and Portugal’s abundant solar and wind resources have made them a hotspot for both domestic and foreign firms looking to leverage the growing demand for renewable energy. This has sparked a flurry of renewable energy deals in the region with the broader global trend towards sustainable investments.', 'Carlos Slim Bets on Mexico’s Mega Oil Projects', 'Mexican\xa0billionaire Carlos Slim’s\xa0Grupo Carso SAB\xa0has\xa0agreed to acquire\xa0PetroBal SAPI’s stake in two oil fields in Campeche in southern Mexico for $530 million, expanding its bet on energy production.\xa0 Under the deal, Grupo Carso will take a 50% stake in the Ichalkil and Pokoch oil fields, the company has revealed in a statement. According to the company, the fields produce about 16,350 barrels of crude oil equivalent per day. Carso shares have jumped to record highs of 181.79 pesos after the deal was announced.', 'Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has welcomed the deal despite earlier being critical of energy reforms that opened exploration to private investment, “Why do I celebrate this? Because it stays in the hands of Mexicans and I’m sure that they’re going to invest to extract crude. I consider that to be good news,” the president said at his daily news conference.', 'Obradors’ nationalist policies have seen the Mexican government become increasingly hostile to foreign companies. Earlier in the year, giant oil and commodities trading firm,\xa0Trafigura, was forced to scale back its oil trading business in Mexico thanks to shrinking margins.\xa0Trafigura has recorded margin compression due to fuel subsidies by the Mexican government.', 'Adnoc Signs LNG Supply Deal With ENN Natural Gas', 'Adnoc\xa0has just signed a 15-year agreement with ENN LNG, a subsidiary of China’s ENN Natural Gas, for the delivery of at least a million metric tonnes a year of LNG. The super-chilled fuel will primarily be sourced from Adnoc’s Ruwais LNG project in Abu Dhabi, with deliveries expected to kick off in 2028. According to Adnoc, the Ruwais plant will be the first LNG project in the region to run on clean power, making it “one of the lowest carbon-intensity LNG facilities in the world”, according to Adnoc.', 'As one of the largest private energy companies in China, ENN has been signing multiple long-term supply deals.\xa0Back in June, Cheniere signed a long-term LNG\xa0sale and purchase agreement\xa0with ENN Energy Holdings. Under terms of the deal, ENN will purchase ~1.8M metric tons/year of LNG on a free-on-board basis at Henry Hub prices for a 20-year term, with deliveries to commence mid-2026 ramping up to 0.9 million tonne per annum (mtpa) in 2027.', 'Egypt, Saudi Arabia Sign $4 bn Green Hydrogen Deal', 'Egypt has reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s\xa0ACWA Power\xa0to develop a green hydrogen project worth $4 billion, the Egyptian government has revealed. Egypt’s minister of Electricity, Dr. Mohamed Shaker, has revealed that an action plan will be implemented shortly for the first phase of the green hydrogen project. The initial phase will have a production capacity of up to 600,000 tons per year of green ammonia with total investments expected to exceed $4 billion.', 'Three years ago, Aramco made the world’s first blue ammonia shipment from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan is looking for dependable suppliers of hydrogen fuel with its mountainous terrain and extreme seismic activity rendering it unsuitable for the development of sustainable renewable energy.', 'Two years ago, Saudi Aramco announced that it had abandoned former plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. The company said that the kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants then convert the remainder into hydrogen.', 'By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Falling Nickel Prices Weigh Heavy on Stainless Steel Industry', 'Armenia Considers Departure from Russia-Led Military Bloc', 'Tellurian Parts Ways with LNG Pioneer Souki', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

This week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against their request to put winter work on hold, allowing construction to move ahead as the court considers arguments in the case.', 'In the company\'s Friday statement, ConocoPhillips\' CEO thanked Alaska political leaders and North Slope Indigenous leaders who advocated for the project ahead of its approval, and promised Willow will be developed ""while adhering to the highest environmental standards.""', ""This winter, ConocoPhillips has said it plans to complete $900 million in construction activity, and expects to employ 1,800 people.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Flowserve's shares before the 28th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 12th of January."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.20 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.80 per share to shareholders.

Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Ralph Lauren's shares before the 28th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.00 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Ralph Lauren has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of $145.47. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Ralph Lauren can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Ralph Lauren paid out a comfortable 38% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 37% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow.

If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Ralph Lauren's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 33% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Ralph Lauren has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.5% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Ralph Lauren? It's great that Ralph Lauren is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like.

You can skip our industry analysis and see the 5 best telecom companies to invest in here.', ""Telecom industry is going through rough times these days because of the heavy ongoing investments into 5G infrastructure as well as tough competition for growth in existing business. The two biggest players in the telecom industry, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), are facing a decline in their shares due to a combination of external factors and internal challenges. External factors, such as rising interest rates and the discovery of an old lead-sheathed telephone cable network, have injected uncertainty into their potential liability for toxic assets. However, much of their struggles stem from internal issues, particularly the difficulty of being mature firms in a saturated market with a substantial debt burden. Their core business of selling mobile and broadband subscriptions is stagnating, with Verizon reporting less than 1% growth in its revenues in the second quarter, and AT&T's equivalent figure rising by just 2.4%. The telecom giants are grappling with increased competition, exemplified by the 2020 merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, creating a formidable 5G competitor offering faster mobile connections at lower prices. Additionally, a partnership between Dish Network (DISH) and Amazon (AMZN) to provide mobile services for $25 a month to Amazon Prime members further intensifies the competitive landscape."", ""The future of the telecom industry is still very promising. First of all, there is still a lot of growth potential regarding 5G adaptation and utilization. Widespread dependence on existing 4G infrastructure hampers the true potential of 5G technology. Many services currently rely on 4G (LTE) foundations, hindering the realization of 5G's advanced capabilities. Expected 5G developments are anticipated to usher in a transformative shift, unlocking innovative digital services, promising faster connectivity, and enhancing stability and security in telecommunications. As the industry advances, the full spectrum of 5G's capabilities is set to materialize, heralding a new era of connectivity and the telecom stocks will benefit from this growth opportunity."", 'Secondly, telecom companies are increasingly integrating cloud models to enhance scalability. This allows for the rapid deployment and trial of new services without incurring substantial infrastructure expenses. The shift to the cloud is particularly beneficial as telecom companies seek to monetize 5G services efficiently. These initiatives will have a positive impact on the telecom companies’ margins.', 'Lastly, AI is extensively utilized by telecom companies to streamline customer services, manage communication traffic, and enhance overall efficiency. Virtual assistants and chatbots play a role in improving responses to technical support and network maintenance requests. Machine learning, integrated with AI, aids in detecting and preventing unauthorized activities. For example, Altice (ATUS) recently reported in its Q3 earnings call a 51% increase in chatbot support volume which extremely enhances its customer experience. AI provides an opportunity to not only reduce cost but also improve customer satisfaction. Again, Altice reported that 1.3M fewer inbound calls over the last 12 months because of AI technology.', 'One underlying trend in the telecom industry is the convergence of wireless, broadband and cable subindustries into a single giant industry where wireless, broadband and cable companies have to compete against all the other telecom companies for growth. As a result of this, there will be winners and losers, and the survivors will probably thrive and deliver market beating returns.', 'A modern telecom center with a visually impressive array of satellite dishes.', 'Methodology', 'Initially we shortlisted the 47 telecom stocks using the holdings of iShares U.S. Telecommunications (IYZ) and SPDR S&P Telecom ETF (XTL).

Established in 1885 as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, AT&T has grown to become a leading global provider of telecommunications, media, and technology services. AT&T ranks 7th on our list of the best telecom companies to invest in.', 'Stephen Luczo, a member of the company’s board of directors, purchased 62,500 shares of the company at an average price of $15.5 a couple of weeks ago. Luczo currently owns 395.5K shares of AT&T.', 'Shares of AT&T have faced challenges in 2023 due to factors such as slowing subscriber growth, economic uncertainty, high debt levels, and concerns about overly optimistic free cash flow projections. However, recent positive developments, including accelerated postpaid phone subscriber gains, low churn rates, and an improved free cash flow outlook, have increased confidence in AT&T. The company now anticipates full-year free cash flow of $16.5 billion, up from the previous estimate of at least $16 billion. Despite a 20% rally since July, the stock is still perceived as undervalued by several hedge funds, presenting an attractive opportunity, especially considering the current low valuation. One of these funds is Miller Value Income Strategy Fund. Here is what they said about AT&T recently:', '“At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.', 'AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time.”', '\xa0', 'Number of HFs: 61', 'Verizon Communications Inc.

This isn't surprising. Whenever there's a new technology, it's natural to see investors clamor to figure out who the winners will be.

The AI mania surrounding Nvidia began when the company reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings (ended July 30, 2023). Total revenue, which was expected to be $11 billion, came in at $14 billion. This represented a year-over-year increase of 101%. This surprise in total revenue was driven by data center revenue, which increased by 171%. The data center growth was a result of chips needed for large tech companies to power their generative AI efforts. The good news for Nvidia has continued from there.', ""This trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, with total revenue expected to increase by more than 200% year over year.

Even if the AI hype wears off, Nvidia has a diversified business and has seen massive success in other areas like gaming and automotive. This company is poised for success in the long run."", ""As mentioned earlier, the AI buzz started when ChatGPT was launched for consumers in November 2022. ChatGPT was developed by a private company called OpenAI, but tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a significant investor in OpenAI. While the billions of dollars it provided to the company doesn't give Microsoft any ownership of OpenAI, it does smooth the way for ChatGPT to be integrated into Microsoft products. The first example of this is Microsoft's browser, Bing. However, the company plans to integrate generative AI into multiple products."", ""If the promise of AI pans out, this could be a significant development for a company like Microsoft, which has a massive market share with products like Microsoft Word and Excel.

But dig deeper, and you'll realize that the gains almost entirely come from a knockout performance from three massive sectors: technology, communications, and consumer discretionary."", ""Here's what you need to know about each sector and whether it's a buy for 2024."", 'The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLC), and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLY) are three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do an excellent job mirroring the performance of their respective sectors.', 'As you can see in the above chart, all three sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 year to date. Combined, they make up a staggering 48.4% of the S&P 500, which illustrates the impact these sectors can have on the market.', 'Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term, ""Magnificent Seven"", to describe the seven stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). It\'s often thought of as referring to technology stocks.', 'In reality, Meta and Alphabet make up about 47% of the SPDR communications sector index, Amazon and Tesla make up about 41% of the consumer discretionary sector index, while Apple and Microsoft make up nearly 45% of the tech sector index, with Nvidia contributing another 4.5%.', ""The takeaway is that all three of these sectors are heavily influenced by the Magnificent Seven. And because the Magnificent Seven stocks are all outperforming this year, it makes sense that communications, consumer discretionary, and tech are outpacing the market's gains."", 'One of the reasons the tech sector continues to outperform the broader indexes is its structure. Out of all the sectors in the stock market, tech stands out as striking a nice balance between proven cash cows and exciting high-growth companies.', ""Apple and Microsoft anchor the sector. Despite trading at a premium to the market, these stocks aren't terribly expensive. They have plenty of cash flows to pay dividends, buy back their own stock, and invest in growth. Then, you have some massive, high-octane growth stocks like Nvidia that are going to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'The tech sector features a nice blend of consumer-facing and business-focused companies, enterprise software from companies like Adobe and Salesforce, and chip companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Intel.', ""The two biggest downsides of tech are its valuation and its cyclicality. Tech investment and growth are heavily dependent on the broader economy, which makes sense given tech is (by far) the most important sector in the U.S. stock market. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the tech sector, according to the SPDR sector fund, is 35.7. That's quite the premium compared to the overall market, represented by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY), which clocks in a P/E ratio of 23.3."", ""Overall, tech is arguably the highest-quality sector in the entire market. But for it to do well in 2024, earnings have to grow because it's hard to see the sector trading at a 40 or 50 P/E ratio."", ""Consumer discretionary is interesting because there are a lot of different themes at play. Unlike Apple and Microsoft, which are two massive tech stocks with some overlap and very similar capital allocation strategies, the two largest companies in the consumer discretionary sector are very different and have virtually no overlap. That's basically the theme across the sector."", ""The top five largest companies are Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's, Home Depot, and Nike -- five completely different companies in five different industries."", ""The advantage of the consumer discretionary sector is that it has more variety than other sectors. McDonald's and Home Depot are dividend-paying value stocks, not growth stocks like Tesla and Amazon. Even Nike is long past its torrid growth rate and is more so a balance between growth, value, and income at this point."", 'Like tech, consumer discretionary is highly cyclical and volatile. This sector is a better value than tech, with a 27.1 P/E ratio.', 'Communications is by far one of the strangest sectors in the stock market. It blends telecommunications (high-yield dividend giants like AT&T and Verizon Communications) with legacy media companies and cable providers, streaming companies, and social media.', 'It gets tricky when you consider Alphabet owns Google Cloud, which has little to do with communications and is more tech focused, just as Amazon Web Services falls under consumer discretionary by default when the subsidiary on its own should be in the tech sector.', 'At the end of 2022, I predicted that the communications sector would dominate 2023 largely because Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) were so beaten down, along with other top holdings in the sector.', 'But going into 2024, I think this is a sector where investors are better off selecting individual stocks based on what they are targeting instead of buying the whole sector. After all, Meta Platforms is one of the best-performing stocks in the whole S&P 500 this year. And some folks may prefer Microsoft as a better overall AI play than Alphabet, while others may prefer to pick Netflix or Disney instead of buying both.', 'The sector sports a P/E ratio of 26.4, but the valuations of its top holdings vary wildly depending on the industry.', ""December is the perfect time to reflect on what moved the market this year and what may move the market next year. It's also a good time to recall the importance of individual stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven, and their effect on the overall market and certain sectors."", ""In terms of buying a sector for next year, I'd say technology stands the best chance at outperforming the S&P 500, consumer discretionary is still a solid overall value and would be the best foundational investment for building a diversified portfolio, and communications is probably the worst of the three to buy outright, but has some compelling turnaround opportunities, particularly in Disney."", ""However, it's important to understand that all three sectors underwent massive run-ups in 2023 and could stall out in the short term, which is why it's best to invest with at least a three- to five-year time frame to avoid the fortune (or misfortune) that results from whatever the market is feeling at the time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn’t one of them.

It's an impressive achievement, which the vast majority of dividend stocks are nowhere near."", ""One stock that is close to achieving that status is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA). If its dividend increases over the next couple of years, the pharmacy retail giant could join the exclusive club of Dividend Kings. But while that sounds great, here's why investors shouldn't really care about this milestone. "", ""A key reason growing companies don't pay dividends is because once you start making recurring payments, there's the expectation you will continue making them. A company may have a great year and think about paying back its shareholders via dividends. But then if it doesn't make the payment again in three months, it gives investors and analysts a reason to grow concerned about the business. After all, if it was doing well enough to pay dividends previously and not anymore, that might be a sign that it's doing worse."", 'Dividend growth streaks are even troublesome. There, the expectation is that the company will continue not only paying dividends, but also increasing them every year. It becomes a game, particularly when times are tough, of how a company can keep the streak going, without really making a significant increase.', 'When Walgreens announced it was increasing its dividend last year, it was the 47th consecutive year that it raised its payouts. But it was a modest 0.5% increase over the previous year.', ""This year, Walgreens hasn't actually announced an increase to the dividend. But it technically didn't need to since the dividends it has paid out this year total $1.92 -- that's still more than $1.915 it paid out last year. The delta is due to the increase taking place in the middle of last year."", 'This means that Walgreens could theoretically wait until the last quarter of 2024 before raising its dividend, and it would still be able to say its dividend has increased from the previous year.', ""That's not unlike what oil and gas giant ExxonMobil did when it waited until the last dividend payment of 2021 to raise its payout. Before that, the company's last dividend increase was in 2019. The magic is in the scheduling of the increases: Exxon raised its dividend at the start of 2019, made no increases in 2020, and waited for the end of 2021 before increasing the payout. The end result is a rising total annual dividend in each one of those years."", ""As you can see, there can be a bit of strategy involved when companies focus on keeping their dividend growth streaks alive. In Exxon's case, it had to deal with low commodity prices due to the pandemic. Conditions have improved since then."", ""In Walgreens' case, however, the problem isn't a cyclical or temporary one. The company has incurred an operating loss in three of its past four quarters. Meanwhile, it's spending billions on rolling out its healthcare strategy in a bid to improve its growth prospects."", ""If Walgreens keeps its streak going, it'll likely follow Exxon's playbook. There may be increases, but they could be timed strategically, and they are also likely to be minimal. For investors, that means achieving the status of a Dividend King may not necessarily all that meaningful."", ""Walgreens' 7.4% dividend yield looks impressive, but it comes with plenty of risk. Even if the company keeps paying it and even increasing the dividend, without stronger financials, it may only be a matter of time before there is a reduction to the payout.

The shift from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled civilizations and societal advancement is primarily attributed to the ability of humans to cultivate their own food and pool resources. Of course, since then, caloric consumption worldwide has expanded significantly due to advancements in agricultural mechanization, leading to increased food production. The United Nations projects a continued growth in global caloric consumption, estimating an increase from 2,789 kilocalories per person in 2000 to 3,139 kilocalories by 2050, representing a 12% growth, as per data from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). In that regard, the food industry stands as one of the vital sectors globally and is often considered a resilient haven during economic downturns. This is because, even in challenging economic times, consumers may cut back on luxury expenses like electronics but will consistently need to purchase essential food items.', ""As we approach the end of 2023, it's noteworthy to highlight certain food items that have demonstrated resilience in the midst of economic challenges and appear to be well-positioned for the coming year.

The coffee titan lost 2% of its value through mid-December even as the broader market rallied by 24%. Meanwhile, Dutch Bros has gained 5% year to date.', ""There are more differences between these companies than just the huge gap in their relative sales bases. Let's look at why an investor might choose one of these stocks over the other right now."", 'Dutch Bros maintains fewer than 1,000 locations across 16 states, giving it a huge potential growth runway for 2024 and beyond. Management sees room for at least 4,000 stores over time, in fact. Executives are backing up that bright forecast with serious investments, too. Dutch Bros plans to launch 130 new locations in fiscal 2023, along with a major roasting facility opening in 2024.', ""Yet Starbucks stock delivers exposure to solid growth possibilities in addition to the stability that comes with its massive global sales footprint. Revenue is expanding at a double-digit rate today, and while its 11% uptick is smaller than Dutch Bros' latest 33% spike, keep in mind that Starbucks boosted revenue by $800 million. Dutch Bros, in contrast, added just $67 million to its Q3 sales base."", ""Starbucks also has its tiny rival beat when it comes to growth at existing locations. Comparable-store sales were up 8% in the core U.S. market last quarter, or twice Dutch Bros' result."", 'Starbucks also looks much more attractive from a finances standpoint. It long ago reached -- and then blew past -- the point where it could fund its own growth. Annual cash flow has now fully rebounded from the post-pandemic slowdown and is back to $6 billion.', ""Conversely, Dutch Bros barely generates positive cash flow. That's why management made two moves this past quarter to raise cash. It upgraded the company's access to credit and issued another stock offering."", ""These moves put Dutch Bros in a good position to invest in building out its store footprint. But they underscore that it will likely be years before the company can be expected to fund itself, let alone spend significant cash on stock buybacks or dividend payments. If you're a fan of direct shareholder returns, Starbucks is your better bet."", ""The good news is that both stocks are available at a discount today compared to their early 2023 prices. You can own Starbucks for just over 3 times annual sales, down from more than 5 at the pandemic peak.

The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns.

During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 9.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.63 points to a change of +5.3% from the prior year.

Michelle, great to see you here. So, Mish, as we think about what the technicals are telling us, going into and perhaps to kick off a potential Santa Claus rally, how strong is the technical case here?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, how could you argue when we've gotten close to or taken out all-time highs in certain indices and made the spectacular rally that we've seen in small caps, now holding at a very key level. So one would have to think, apart from any kind of consequential thing that happens in the world, which of course, we've got these powder kegs all over, that we should at least hold relatively steady into the end of this year, and in January, start out well. Of course, the Fed has a lot to do with it, and today's numbers really support that. So at this point, we're saying that, I think, the real growth for next year will be more in the small caps and in the manufacturing industrials. Obviously, the Dow has been the champion so far the last couple of months. See no reason for that to continue right now."", ""SEANA SMITH: So, Mish, when you're trying to figure out some of those positions or plays that are better positioned than others, you just mentioned some of the names there at the top of your list, in terms of investment themes, when you're taking a look at some of the technicals and some of the levels here that we are hovering as we start 2024, what's at the top of the list in terms of what you like, and why?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, I have to say gold. It's separate from everything we just talked about, the [INAUDIBLE] picture. But gold, even this morning, before it opens, is going near all time highs. And to me, what it's really telling you right now is, regardless of what's happening, gold is a safety blanket that I think everybody needs to have. And even though this year, it hasn't had quite the stellar returns that we've seen in so many other areas, I think that could really change as we go into 2024, and that would also mean silver and probably some of the Industrial metals. So that might be the safest call out I can say right now."", ""But there are other areas I'm looking at, as well. What was very interesting to me over the last few months was this you-only-live-once attitude by consumers. Consumers have really helped keep this market up, even though we know that, if you look under the surface, there's been a lot of problems with credit card delinquencies and high interest rates, et cetera, they're still out there, even though Nike had the poor earnings. They have actually done what they needed to do to get us to this point."", ""I think we could see a shift in that from, well, let me take care of my family and friends and travel and have fun, to let me take care more of myself. So we're looking at skin care, beauty, fashion, maybe some more cosmetic-type surgeries. These kinds of things that people put on the shelf might come back. So we, like certain names like Coty, and Elf, and Ralph Lauren, and areas like that, that will have more personal reflection of people's attitude.""]"

So one would have to think, apart from any kind of consequential thing that happens in the world, which of course, we've got these powder kegs all over, that we should at least hold relatively steady into the end of this year, and in January, start out well. Of course, the Fed has a lot to do with it, and today's numbers really support that. So at this point, we're saying that, I think, the real growth for next year will be more in the small caps and in the manufacturing industrials. Obviously, the Dow has been the champion so far the last couple of months. See no reason for that to continue right now."", ""SEANA SMITH: So, Mish, when you're trying to figure out some of those positions or plays that are better positioned than others, you just mentioned some of the names there at the top of your list, in terms of investment themes, when you're taking a look at some of the technicals and some of the levels here that we are hovering as we start 2024, what's at the top of the list in terms of what you like, and why?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, I have to say gold. It's separate from everything we just talked about, the [INAUDIBLE] picture. But gold, even this morning, before it opens, is going near all time highs. And to me, what it's really telling you right now is, regardless of what's happening, gold is a safety blanket that I think everybody needs to have. And even though this year, it hasn't had quite the stellar returns that we've seen in so many other areas, I think that could really change as we go into 2024, and that would also mean silver and probably some of the Industrial metals. So that might be the safest call out I can say right now."", ""But there are other areas I'm looking at, as well. What was very interesting to me over the last few months was this you-only-live-once attitude by consumers. Consumers have really helped keep this market up, even though we know that, if you look under the surface, there's been a lot of problems with credit card delinquencies and high interest rates, et cetera, they're still out there, even though Nike had the poor earnings. They have actually done what they needed to do to get us to this point."", ""I think we could see a shift in that from, well, let me take care of my family and friends and travel and have fun, to let me take care more of myself. So we're looking at skin care, beauty, fashion, maybe some more cosmetic-type surgeries. These kinds of things that people put on the shelf might come back.

(NYSE:WEC) has announced that the dividend on 1st of March will be increased to $0.835, which will be 7.1% higher than last year's payment of $0.78 which covered the same period. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.8%."", ' See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ', 'Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, WEC Energy Group was paying out quite a large proportion of both earnings and cash flow, with the dividend being 557% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows can expose the business to needing to cut the dividend if the business runs into some challenges.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 27.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 62% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.36, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.12. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.7% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, WEC Energy Group's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. There are exceptions, but limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio can signal that a company has reached maturity. That's fine as far as it goes, but we're less enthusiastic as this often signals that the dividend is likely to grow slower in the future."", ""Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think WEC Energy Group will make a great income stock. While WEC Energy Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, WEC Energy Group has 2 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

One particular choice, though, could actually grow that money into a whole lot more. I'm talking about investing. If you invest in a variety of solid companies over time -- at least five years -- you could see the amount of your bonus multiply."", ""So, which stocks should you choose? It's a great idea to go with companies that have demonstrated earnings strength over time -- and remain leaders in their markets so they may continue growing earnings into the future. You also should consider stocks that pay dividends, to offer you passive income every year. Finally, you'll want to look at valuation and choose stocks that are reasonably priced right now."", ""Ready to get started? Let's check out five top stocks that could grow your bonus over the long run if you buy today."", 'Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a healthcare giant with four solid businesses: diagnostics, medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, and nutrition. This is a plus because if one day a particular business faces headwinds, the other units may compensate.', ""Here's a recent example: During earlier days of the pandemic, Abbott's leadership in coronavirus testing brought in billions of dollars, but today, testing demand is on the decline. Still, the company's strength in other areas helped it generate double-digit sales growth in the third quarter -- and report $10 billion in sales. Excluding coronavirus testing, each of the four units reported double-digit sales increases."", ""You'll also like Abbott for its dividend growth. As a Dividend King, it's lifted its payment for more than 50 consecutive years. That suggests rewarding shareholders is important to the company so it's likely to continue on that path."", 'Today, Abbott shares trade for 24 times forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable price for this blend of passive income and earnings strength.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is another Dividend King that you'll want to add to your portfolio. The company has the free cash flow -- at more than $10 billion -- and the earnings power to support ongoing dividend increases. And, as with Abbott, it's clear this long track record of dividend growth shows the company is committed to sharing its successes with shareholders."", ""Speaking of earnings, even in tougher times, the world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker has managed to raise prices and increase revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue and net income climbed -- and the company lifted its full-year revenue forecast. This is thanks to Coca-Cola's solid brand, which serves as its moat or competitive advantage. Fans of the company's eponymous drink and its other popular brands such as Minute Maid juices keep coming back and won't easily switch to the competition."", ""Today, Coca-Cola shares trade for 21 times forward earnings estimates, a great price for this market giant that you'll want to hold on to for the long haul."", ""I've got one more Dividend King for you: healthcare powerhouse Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company, like the two above, has made dividend payments a priority and recently reiterated its commitment to dividend growth."", 'Right now is a particularly interesting time to invest in J&J because, earlier this year, the company made a major move to spur growth. J&J spun off its slower-growth consumer health business so that it can focus on its two higher-growth businesses: pharmaceuticals and medtech. It collected more than $13 billion from the operation -- that could come in handy to support internal pipeline growth or to acquire external programs.', 'J&J recently said it aims to launch more than 20 new therapies and 50 product expansions by 2030 -- and the company expects to have more than 10 products with peak year sales potential of $5 billion or more.', 'Today, J&J shares trade for 15 times forward earnings estimates, a steal for this healthcare leader as it heads into a new era of growth.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is the global market leader in cystic fibrosis treatment, bringing in billions of dollars in earnings annually. This leadership is likely to last through the late 2030s thanks to its current blockbuster, Trikafta, and potential new products on the horizon.', ""On top of this, Vertex is expanding into other areas. The company and partner CRISPR Therapeutics recently scored a win when they received regulatory approval of Casgevy, their gene-editing treatment for blood disorders. The product has blockbuster potential and also demonstrates that Vertex has what it takes to expand beyond one treatment area. And here, there's more to come. Vertex's pipeline is strong, and the company now is wrapping up a pivotal program in the very promising area of pain management."", 'Even though Vertex shares have climbed this year, the stock trades for only 26 times times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable price considering forecasts for double-digit annual growth over the coming five years.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown earnings over the years thanks to consumers' love for its must-have products like the iPhone and Mac. And this brand strength is Apple's moat -- iPhone fans are unlikely to forgo the latest version and opt for another brand. This loyalty should help the company continue to post revenue gains well into the future."", 'And this loyalty has also helped Apple create a second revenue stream beyond just selling its devices. Apple now can generate more and more revenue through sales of services to device owners. The company this year reached more than 1 billion paying subscribers, and this helped Apple report record-high services revenue in the most recent quarter. By services, I mean everything from digital content to iCloud storage.', ""Apple shares advanced this year, but they're still trading for only 30 times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable level for this top tech company as it heads into a new era of growth led by services strength."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Abbott Laboratories right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Abbott Laboratories, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Abbott Laboratories wasn't one of them.

The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on TE Connectivity is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.15 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$22b - US$4.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, TE Connectivity has an ROCE of 15%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 12% generated by the Electronic industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for TE Connectivity compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering TE Connectivity here  for free."", ""Things have been pretty stable at TE Connectivity, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect TE Connectivity to be a multi-bagger going forward."", ""We can conclude that in regards to TE Connectivity's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 106% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years.

(NYSE:NKE) shareholders, with the stock dropping 11% to US$108 in the week since its latest quarterly results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$13b were what the analysts expected, NIKE surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$1.03 per share, an impressive 22% above what was forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for NIKE ', ""Following last week's earnings report, NIKE's 37 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$52.2b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 4.4% to US$3.63. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$53.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.73 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$124, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on NIKE, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$150 and the most bearish at US$88.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that NIKE's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 2.6% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 7.0% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.6% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that NIKE is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that NIKE's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on NIKE. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple NIKE analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You can also see our  analysis of NIKE's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock."", 'Have feedback on this article?

But dig deeper, and you'll realize that the gains almost entirely come from a knockout performance from three massive sectors: technology, communications, and consumer discretionary."", ""Here's what you need to know about each sector and whether it's a buy for 2024."", 'The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLC), and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLY) are three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do an excellent job mirroring the performance of their respective sectors.', 'As you can see in the above chart, all three sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 year to date. Combined, they make up a staggering 48.4% of the S&P 500, which illustrates the impact these sectors can have on the market.', 'Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term, ""Magnificent Seven"", to describe the seven stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). It\'s often thought of as referring to technology stocks.', 'In reality, Meta and Alphabet make up about 47% of the SPDR communications sector index, Amazon and Tesla make up about 41% of the consumer discretionary sector index, while Apple and Microsoft make up nearly 45% of the tech sector index, with Nvidia contributing another 4.5%.', ""The takeaway is that all three of these sectors are heavily influenced by the Magnificent Seven. And because the Magnificent Seven stocks are all outperforming this year, it makes sense that communications, consumer discretionary, and tech are outpacing the market's gains."", 'One of the reasons the tech sector continues to outperform the broader indexes is its structure. Out of all the sectors in the stock market, tech stands out as striking a nice balance between proven cash cows and exciting high-growth companies.', ""Apple and Microsoft anchor the sector. Despite trading at a premium to the market, these stocks aren't terribly expensive. They have plenty of cash flows to pay dividends, buy back their own stock, and invest in growth. Then, you have some massive, high-octane growth stocks like Nvidia that are going to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'The tech sector features a nice blend of consumer-facing and business-focused companies, enterprise software from companies like Adobe and Salesforce, and chip companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Intel.', ""The two biggest downsides of tech are its valuation and its cyclicality. Tech investment and growth are heavily dependent on the broader economy, which makes sense given tech is (by far) the most important sector in the U.S. stock market. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the tech sector, according to the SPDR sector fund, is 35.7. That's quite the premium compared to the overall market, represented by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY), which clocks in a P/E ratio of 23.3."", ""Overall, tech is arguably the highest-quality sector in the entire market. But for it to do well in 2024, earnings have to grow because it's hard to see the sector trading at a 40 or 50 P/E ratio."", ""Consumer discretionary is interesting because there are a lot of different themes at play. Unlike Apple and Microsoft, which are two massive tech stocks with some overlap and very similar capital allocation strategies, the two largest companies in the consumer discretionary sector are very different and have virtually no overlap. That's basically the theme across the sector."", ""The top five largest companies are Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's, Home Depot, and Nike -- five completely different companies in five different industries."", ""The advantage of the consumer discretionary sector is that it has more variety than other sectors. McDonald's and Home Depot are dividend-paying value stocks, not growth stocks like Tesla and Amazon. Even Nike is long past its torrid growth rate and is more so a balance between growth, value, and income at this point."", 'Like tech, consumer discretionary is highly cyclical and volatile. This sector is a better value than tech, with a 27.1 P/E ratio.', 'Communications is by far one of the strangest sectors in the stock market. It blends telecommunications (high-yield dividend giants like AT&T and Verizon Communications) with legacy media companies and cable providers, streaming companies, and social media.', 'It gets tricky when you consider Alphabet owns Google Cloud, which has little to do with communications and is more tech focused, just as Amazon Web Services falls under consumer discretionary by default when the subsidiary on its own should be in the tech sector.', 'At the end of 2022, I predicted that the communications sector would dominate 2023 largely because Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) were so beaten down, along with other top holdings in the sector.', 'But going into 2024, I think this is a sector where investors are better off selecting individual stocks based on what they are targeting instead of buying the whole sector. After all, Meta Platforms is one of the best-performing stocks in the whole S&P 500 this year. And some folks may prefer Microsoft as a better overall AI play than Alphabet, while others may prefer to pick Netflix or Disney instead of buying both.', 'The sector sports a P/E ratio of 26.4, but the valuations of its top holdings vary wildly depending on the industry.', ""December is the perfect time to reflect on what moved the market this year and what may move the market next year. It's also a good time to recall the importance of individual stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven, and their effect on the overall market and certain sectors."", ""In terms of buying a sector for next year, I'd say technology stands the best chance at outperforming the S&P 500, consumer discretionary is still a solid overall value and would be the best foundational investment for building a diversified portfolio, and communications is probably the worst of the three to buy outright, but has some compelling turnaround opportunities, particularly in Disney."", ""However, it's important to understand that all three sectors underwent massive run-ups in 2023 and could stall out in the short term, which is why it's best to invest with at least a three- to five-year time frame to avoid the fortune (or misfortune) that results from whatever the market is feeling at the time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestment plans and performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', ""Investing in dividend stocks is often seen as a game for patient investors because it typically yields better returns over the long haul. The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns.

It is struggling due to declining demand for its COVID products. And it may take some years before its top line starts rising meaningfully again. The company's recent forecast didn't help matters, either. But with the stock losing close to half its value this year, are investors being overly punitive on what's still a top healthcare company?"", ""On Dec. 13, Pfizer unveiled its forecast for the coming year, and to say it wasn't an exciting one would be an understatement. For 2024, the company projects that its revenue will be within a range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion. And this even includes revenue it will generate from its recently closed acquisition of cancer company Seagen, which is no small operation -- Pfizer projects that Seagen will add $3.1 billion in revenue next year."", ""This year, the company projects its revenue to fall within a range of $58 billion to $61 billion. That means that Pfizer's business would likely experience a decline in revenue next year, if not for its recent acquisition. The best-case scenario for the company is that its revenue stays flat or achieves a modest increase in 2024. A year ago, Pfizer reported a record-breaking $100 billion in sales due to surging revenue from its COVID vaccine and pill."", ""While the forecast is underwhelming, it also shouldn't come as a big surprise to investors. COVID isn't striking fear into people the way it was even a year ago. Demand for vaccines has been diminishing, and Pfizer investors have already been seeing the effects of that on the company's financials."", ""Year to date, Pfizer's global revenue of $21.8 billion has declined 48% from the same period in 2022. A big part of the reason is that Comirnaty, the company's COVID vaccine, has experienced a 78% decline in sales."", ""Next year, Pfizer is projecting that revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid (its COVID treatment) will still bring in $8 billion. That's the part of the forecast that may be concerning as demand for COVID vaccines and treatments has proven to be difficult to predict. But an overall slowdown in the business shouldn't be surprising for Pfizer investors."", ""Pfizer's stock fell by nearly 7% after the company released its forecast. It has bounced back since then, but that may have more to do with the rally in the markets of late. Year to date, it is still down more than 45%. The stock is trading at just 10 times based on its future profits (based on analyst estimates). That suggests investors aren't overly optimistic about the company's future."", ""However, Pfizer has been planning for growth in the long term. The company plans to add $25 billion in new additional revenue by 2030, with acquisitions such as Seagen playing a key part of that strategy. That will help in offsetting a decline in revenue from drugs losing patent protection and facing increased competition in the years ahead. But it won't be enough to get the company back to generating $100 billion in sales. The important takeaway for investors is that Pfizer is making efforts to grow its business, which means that in the long haul, this could still be a good growth stock to own."", 'Pfizer has the potential to be one of the most undervalued stocks heading into next year.

In the ongoing study, immunocompromised patients given an infusion of VYD222 produced high levels of serum virus-neutralizing antibodies (sVNA) against the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5.', ""The stock popped because the sVNA levels among immunocompromised participants were in line with the levels recorded in healthy volunteers in a phase 1 study. Antibody production was also similar to the levels produced by VYD222's predecessor treatment against early strains of the virus."", ""VYD222 was engineered from adintrevimab, a still-experimental antibody that produced positive results in a pivotal study that took place before the omicron variant evolved. However, Adintrevimab's difficulty with neutralizing omicron variants meant the end of its path forward, and decimated Invivyd's stock price back when the company was still called Adagio Therapeutics.

This is a relatively small addressable patient population, but VYD222 wouldn't have to be a blockbuster drug for Invivyd to produce big returns for investors who buy the stock now."", ""Invivyd's market cap is around $413 million. If VYD222 takes further steps toward commercialization or if it attracts a buyout offer for Invivyd, the stock could soar."", 'Before you throw any of your hard-earned money at Invivyd, understand that this stock is about as risky as they get.

Since then, the pharma giant has lowered its COVID-19 sales expectations to $12.5 billion this year and just $8 billion in 2024.', ""While VYD222 could complement Pfizer's lineup, the sinking sales of COVID-19 vaccines and antivirals could make finding a big pharma partner eager to help Invivyd launch it an uphill slog."", ""Management says it's in alignment with the FDA regarding bridging studies, but just how well aligned is still anybody's guess. The agency will not comment on the accuracy of a drug developer's communications with investors."", ""Down the road, if we learn that the FDA isn't willing to approve or authorize VYD222 with relatively simple bridging studies, Invivyd stock could crumble.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestment plans and performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', ""Investing in dividend stocks is often seen as a game for patient investors because it typically yields better returns over the long haul. The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns.

Wall Street's three major stock indexes have ping-ponged between bull and bear markets on a couple of occasions over the past four years, with the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gyrating the most."", 'As of the closing bell on Dec. 20, the Nasdaq Composite had rallied 41% year to date and nearly 45% from its 2022 bear market closing low of 10,213.29 on Dec. 28, 2022. Nevertheless, the Nasdaq remains 8% below its record-closing high, which was set in November 2021.', 'Short-term traders are likely to view the past 25 months as a lost period for growth stocks. But for patient investors who lean on time as an ally, dips in the Nasdaq Composite are nothing more than red-carpet opportunities to pounce on great companies at a discount.', ""What follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first industry juggernaut that's begging to be bought with the Nasdaq Composite still meaningfully below its record-closing high is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of popular internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures."", ""The best argument I can muster for why Alphabet isn't taking out its record high right now is because investors are worried about a recession in 2024. A couple of economic data points and predictive tools indicate that a downturn is likely in the new year. Since Alphabet generated 78% of its sales from advertising during the September-ended quarter, there's a very real likelihood that economic weakness would sap ad spending and some of its ad pricing power (at least temporarily)."", 'But the U.S. economy is a two-way street that very much favors optimists. While the typical recession lasts for less than a year, most periods of economic growth since the end of World War II have endured for multiple years, if not a full decade. More often than not, Alphabet is enjoying incredible ad-pricing power.', ""Furthermore, Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search. It held 91.54% of global search in November, per GlobalStats, and has been responsible for at least a 90% monthly share of worldwide search looking back more than eight years. This absolute dominance for Alphabet's foundational operating segment makes it the logical choice for advertisers wanting to target potential customers."", 'Cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud is no slouch, either. Enterprise cloud spending can sustain a double-digit growth rate for a long time to come. Additionally, Google Cloud has turned in three consecutive quarters of operating profit following years of losses.', ""Among the widely owned FAANG stocks, Alphabet is one of the cheapest. Shares can currently be purchased for around 14x forward-year cash flow, which is well below the 18x cash flow it's averaged over the previous five years."", ""A second colossal growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio following the Nasdaq bear market decline is China-based e-commerce behemoth Alibaba (NYSE: BABA)."", ""Let me state upfront that China stocks come with added regulatory/oversight risks. For instance, Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion in 2021 by Chinese regulators for its anti-monopoly practices. There was also a period of time in 2022 where China stocks were at risk of delisting from major U.S. exchanges if Chinese companies didn't allow U.S. regulators access to three years of audited financial statements. While these issues are now in the rearview mirror, they're a reminder of why China stocks usually have lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios than U.S.-based stocks."", ""Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about Alibaba's future. For starters, China is still in the process of bouncing back following the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's stringent and unpredictable lockdowns wreaked havoc on supply chains. Given that China's e-commerce industry is still in its early stages of ramping up, there's a long growth runway in front of Alibaba as China's economy regains its footing."", ""To add to the above, Alibaba dominates the e-commerce space. Data from the International Trade Administration pegs Alibaba's online shopping sites Taobao and Tmall as collectively accounting for almost 51% of China's e-commerce share."", ""Don't overlook Alibaba's leading cloud services segment, either. According to Canalys, Alibaba accounted for more than a third of cloud infrastructure services spending in China during the March-ended quarter. This is another sustained double-digit growth opportunity."", ""Alibaba stock can be purchased right now for 7x forward-year earnings, or closer to 5x forward-year earnings if you back out its more than $77 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity securities. That's dirt cheap for an industry leader!"", ""The third tremendous growth stock you'll regret not scooping up following the Nasdaq bear market swoon is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR)."", ""Shares of Fiverr have retraced more than 90% from their all-time high, which was set during a period of investment euphoria that occurred in 2021. The company's at-the-time nosebleed valuation, coupled with the aforementioned prospect of weaker economic growth, have worked together to push Fiverr's shares notably lower. But after a more than two-year downtrend, Fiverr's stock looks like a steal."", ""One factor clearly working in its favor is the permanent shift we've witnessed in the labor market. Though some workers have returned to the office with the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic now in the rearview mirror, more people have chosen to remain remote than ever before. This is music to the ears of a freelancer-driven platform like Fiverr that connects mobile workers with businesses that need their services."", ""Another reason Fiverr should have no trouble standing out is the company's unique online-services marketplace. Whereas most of its competitors allow freelancers to market their tasks on an hourly basis, Fiverr freelancers are pricing their jobs as an all-in cost. The price transparency offered on Fiverr's platform is unmatched, and it's likely played a key role in continuously increasing spend per buyer."", ""But the top selling point for this fast-growing small-cap stock is its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform, including fees, that it gets to keep. While the take rate for its top competitors is in the mid-to-high teens, Fiverr's take rate in the September-ended quarter expanded to 31.3%. Fiverr is continually netting more from each deal without driving away its freelancers or buyers."", 'A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 is a phenomenal deal for a company capable of doubling its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) many times over in the years to come.', ""The fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is none other than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL)."", ""Similar to Fiverr, PayPal's stock has been clobbered since hitting a record high in 2021. Shares dropped more than 80% as fears of a recession picked up and the prevailing U.S. inflation rate soared."", 'The latter is particularly worrisome for digital payment networks.

""We are the only company that has been issuing regulated stablecoins at scale—period.""', 'Cofounded by financial veteran Charles Cascarilla, Paxos became the first crypto firm to receive a trust charter under the new digital asset regulatory regime implemented by DFS in 2015. To this day, DFS remains the sole U.S. financial regulator to implement a comprehensive framework for crypto, which has attracted a number of leading companies, including Coinbase and Gemini.', ""Paxos received DFS approval to issue its first stablecoin in 2018, which it called Paxos Standard, rebranding the token to USDP in 2021. Stablecoins are a type of crypto token pegged to an underlying asset—in this case, the U.S. dollar. Unlike the other leading USD-pegged stablecoins Tether and Circle's USD Coin, Paxos only issues USDP on Ethereum due to restrictions by DFS."", 'Paxos has argued that its commitment to working directly with DFS on issuance, rather than operating outside of the framework of a financial regulator, sets it apart from competitors. While Tether is often critiqued for its offshore, opaque operations, Circle also presents itself as following U.S. regulatory standards, although it does not issue USDC under DFS supervision. As a result, Circle offers USDC across more than a dozen blockchains, including Tron, which has come under fire in recent months for facilitating illicit finance.', '""From a growth perspective, you\'d like to issue across every single chain,"" Hessert said. ""Circle and other players can issue on to other protocols, but no one knows who\'s overseeing it—or what their process is.""', ""He argued that Paxos's approach helps gain trust with its partners, including major financial players like MercadoLibre, Paypal, and Mastercard, that customer protections are in place."", ""Even so, Paxos has had its missteps. One of its first stablecoins, BUSD, was issued in partnership with the leading crypto exchange Binance. After reports surfaced that Binance was creating a synthetic version of the stablecoin with questionable reserves, DFS ordered Paxos to stop issuing the token. As Fortune later reported, over 95% of Paxos's revenue came from that partnership."", 'Paxos received a ""non-objection"" from DFS to expand USDP from Ethereum to Solana, after what a spokesperson described as an ""extensive and exhaustive review,"" although the firm declined to specify how long the process took.', 'While Hessert declined to say what type of information DFS required for the Solana expansion, citing the confidential supervisory process, he said it involved an internal risk framework built by Paxos to assess the blockchain and its processes, including its compliance protocols.', 'First launched in early 2020 with the promise of increasing transaction speeds and reducing costs compared to Ethereum, Solana became one of the most popular blockchains before taking a major hit last year due to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried. While its native token, SOL, is still far off from its all-time high of about $260, it has gained substantial traction over the past month.', 'View this interactive chart on Fortune.com', ""Hessert said Solana's speed and cost relative to Ethereum will make it an attractive option for Paxos's partners, who aim to implement stablecoin in use cases from cross-border remittances to payments for goods and services."", '""We\'re actually going to start to see this new wave of adoption be enabled in ways that we haven\'t seen in stablecoins yet,"" he told Fortune.', ""For now, Paxos's highest-profile project is its new stablecoin PYUSD, issued in partnership with PayPal. Hessert said he imagines that firms like PayPal will want to expand to Solana. Paxos's first Solana-based offering will be USDP, which has a market cap of just $370 million, compared to nearly $25 billion for USDC and nearly $94 billion for Tether."", 'A spokesperson for PayPal declined to comment.', 'Hessert said Paxos hopes to gain approval to issue stablecoins across other layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, although he declined to provide specific examples.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The social aspect of golf attracts Gen Z players, with 81% highlighting it as a motivating factor.

However, mini-golf faces limited accessibility, with only 33% being publicly owned or accessible, despite experiencing a decline.On a per capita basis, each individual in the United States contributed US$7.09 to this revenue in 2023. This underscores the significance of the thriving and profitable Golf Equipment industry, especially in the United States, where there's a notable uptick in demand for top-notch golf gear. Players are increasingly seeking high-quality equipment to elevate their game and maintain competitiveness within the sport.While the market for new boat sales has stabilized, consumer confidence remains strong.

By 2028, approximately 25% of the total revenues in the Cruises market is anticipated to be generated through online sales.The theme park industry has likely thrived due to strong consumer spending and significant investments in new entertainment experiences, shows and digital upgrades for guests. Initiatives like launching diverse-age-targeted shows, enhancing fireworks displays and live performances and exploring fast-entry gates and automated ticketing areas represent smart strategic moves. The changing landscape of social media marketing and technological advancements has driven consumers to seek personalized experiences when planning trips and making reservations.Companies are also constructing hotels integrated with their parks, aiming to attract guests from other properties, extend guest stays, offer enticing vacation packages and enhance guest services to foster loyalty and generate an appealing ROI. We see further potential for growth as these companies monitor additional business opportunities and adapt to evolving customer preferences.Per the report, the US Amusement and Theme Park Industry will likely experience a growth rate surpassing 3.5% between 2020 and 2025.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions.

In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

So to tell us more on what she's expecting, we've got Michelle Snyder, marketgauge.com Partner and Director of Trading, Research, and Education here with us, and good friend of the show, as well. Michelle, great to see you here. So, Mish, as we think about what the technicals are telling us, going into and perhaps to kick off a potential Santa Claus rally, how strong is the technical case here?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, how could you argue when we've gotten close to or taken out all-time highs in certain indices and made the spectacular rally that we've seen in small caps, now holding at a very key level. So one would have to think, apart from any kind of consequential thing that happens in the world, which of course, we've got these powder kegs all over, that we should at least hold relatively steady into the end of this year, and in January, start out well. Of course, the Fed has a lot to do with it, and today's numbers really support that. So at this point, we're saying that, I think, the real growth for next year will be more in the small caps and in the manufacturing industrials. Obviously, the Dow has been the champion so far the last couple of months. See no reason for that to continue right now."", ""SEANA SMITH: So, Mish, when you're trying to figure out some of those positions or plays that are better positioned than others, you just mentioned some of the names there at the top of your list, in terms of investment themes, when you're taking a look at some of the technicals and some of the levels here that we are hovering as we start 2024, what's at the top of the list in terms of what you like, and why?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, I have to say gold. It's separate from everything we just talked about, the [INAUDIBLE] picture. But gold, even this morning, before it opens, is going near all time highs. And to me, what it's really telling you right now is, regardless of what's happening, gold is a safety blanket that I think everybody needs to have. And even though this year, it hasn't had quite the stellar returns that we've seen in so many other areas, I think that could really change as we go into 2024, and that would also mean silver and probably some of the Industrial metals. So that might be the safest call out I can say right now."", ""But there are other areas I'm looking at, as well. What was very interesting to me over the last few months was this you-only-live-once attitude by consumers. Consumers have really helped keep this market up, even though we know that, if you look under the surface, there's been a lot of problems with credit card delinquencies and high interest rates, et cetera, they're still out there, even though Nike had the poor earnings. They have actually done what they needed to do to get us to this point."", ""I think we could see a shift in that from, well, let me take care of my family and friends and travel and have fun, to let me take care more of myself. So we're looking at skin care, beauty, fashion, maybe some more cosmetic-type surgeries. These kinds of things that people put on the shelf might come back. So we, like certain names like Coty, and Elf, and Ralph Lauren, and areas like that, that will have more personal reflection of people's attitude.""]"

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:', '22% = US$21b ÷ US$99b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.22 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Verizon Communications has a superior ROE than the average (6.0%) in the Telecom industry."", ""That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.53. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

You can skip our industry analysis and see the 5 best telecom companies to invest in here.', ""Telecom industry is going through rough times these days because of the heavy ongoing investments into 5G infrastructure as well as tough competition for growth in existing business. The two biggest players in the telecom industry, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), are facing a decline in their shares due to a combination of external factors and internal challenges. External factors, such as rising interest rates and the discovery of an old lead-sheathed telephone cable network, have injected uncertainty into their potential liability for toxic assets. However, much of their struggles stem from internal issues, particularly the difficulty of being mature firms in a saturated market with a substantial debt burden. Their core business of selling mobile and broadband subscriptions is stagnating, with Verizon reporting less than 1% growth in its revenues in the second quarter, and AT&T's equivalent figure rising by just 2.4%. The telecom giants are grappling with increased competition, exemplified by the 2020 merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, creating a formidable 5G competitor offering faster mobile connections at lower prices. Additionally, a partnership between Dish Network (DISH) and Amazon (AMZN) to provide mobile services for $25 a month to Amazon Prime members further intensifies the competitive landscape."", ""The future of the telecom industry is still very promising. First of all, there is still a lot of growth potential regarding 5G adaptation and utilization. Widespread dependence on existing 4G infrastructure hampers the true potential of 5G technology. Many services currently rely on 4G (LTE) foundations, hindering the realization of 5G's advanced capabilities. Expected 5G developments are anticipated to usher in a transformative shift, unlocking innovative digital services, promising faster connectivity, and enhancing stability and security in telecommunications. As the industry advances, the full spectrum of 5G's capabilities is set to materialize, heralding a new era of connectivity and the telecom stocks will benefit from this growth opportunity."", 'Secondly, telecom companies are increasingly integrating cloud models to enhance scalability. This allows for the rapid deployment and trial of new services without incurring substantial infrastructure expenses. The shift to the cloud is particularly beneficial as telecom companies seek to monetize 5G services efficiently. These initiatives will have a positive impact on the telecom companies’ margins.', 'Lastly, AI is extensively utilized by telecom companies to streamline customer services, manage communication traffic, and enhance overall efficiency. Virtual assistants and chatbots play a role in improving responses to technical support and network maintenance requests. Machine learning, integrated with AI, aids in detecting and preventing unauthorized activities. For example, Altice (ATUS) recently reported in its Q3 earnings call a 51% increase in chatbot support volume which extremely enhances its customer experience. AI provides an opportunity to not only reduce cost but also improve customer satisfaction. Again, Altice reported that 1.3M fewer inbound calls over the last 12 months because of AI technology.', 'One underlying trend in the telecom industry is the convergence of wireless, broadband and cable subindustries into a single giant industry where wireless, broadband and cable companies have to compete against all the other telecom companies for growth. As a result of this, there will be winners and losers, and the survivors will probably thrive and deliver market beating returns.', 'A modern telecom center with a visually impressive array of satellite dishes.', 'Methodology', 'Initially we shortlisted the 47 telecom stocks using the holdings of iShares U.S. Telecommunications (IYZ) and SPDR S&P Telecom ETF (XTL).

Luczo currently owns 395.5K shares of AT&T.', 'Shares of AT&T have faced challenges in 2023 due to factors such as slowing subscriber growth, economic uncertainty, high debt levels, and concerns about overly optimistic free cash flow projections. However, recent positive developments, including accelerated postpaid phone subscriber gains, low churn rates, and an improved free cash flow outlook, have increased confidence in AT&T. The company now anticipates full-year free cash flow of $16.5 billion, up from the previous estimate of at least $16 billion. Despite a 20% rally since July, the stock is still perceived as undervalued by several hedge funds, presenting an attractive opportunity, especially considering the current low valuation. One of these funds is Miller Value Income Strategy Fund. Here is what they said about AT&T recently:', '“At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.', 'AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate.

However, this figure jumped to more than $1.2 billion at the beginning of 2020. In early 2023, inflows from retail investors in stock trades were around $1.5 billion.\xa0', 'A variety of factors have contributed to this rise. The advent of commission-free online trading platforms, stimulus payments from the government, and boredom induced by pandemic lockdowns have all come together to create a perfect storm for retail traders. Even as inflation battered growth stocks in late 2021 and throughout 2022 and 2023, retail investors continued piling into their favorite undervalued firms like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

Between 2009 and 2019, only about 55% of Americans, on average, had dabbled in stock trades. This number was over 61% in the preceding decade. Since 2020, this figure has climbed back up from 55% to 58%. Part of this has to do with the boom in growth stocks that has pushed the market capitalizations of some big tech firms into trillions of dollars, boosting the brand value of the market as a whole.\xa0', 'The earnings call of stock trading firm Robinhood Markets, Inc.

Our thesis was that emerging artificial intelligence (AI), automotive, industrial, and security markets would soon dwarf the company’s declining consumer market. After significant outperformance in 2021driven by strong demand for AI-enabled computer vision chips in a variety of applications, Ambarella’s stock has been weak since2022 and was again this quarter. Ambarella’s legacy products, mainly image processors for low-end security cameras, are in decline while the company re-focuses its resources on its computer vision chips, which are enabled for AI processing. The company has a core competency in placing very complicated algorithms on individual chips in a very power-efficient way, placing Ambarella in a strong leadership position as AI capabilities shift from centralized data centers to inference at the edge, a fast-growing future market.

Recently, the journalist investor has been outlining his thoughts on recession fears, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the policies of the US government on mergers and acquisitions. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who returned more than 20% to investors annually for more than ten years.\xa0', 'On December 13, Cramer lauded the decision of the central bank to keep interest rates steady for the next few months, describing it as a win for the bulls at the stock market. Cramer was of the view that the Fed had already achieved a soft landing for the US economy, predicting that many sectors would soar as the pace of growth picked up once again. Cramer stressed that even though interest rates might start coming down, investors could still make money from cyclical sectors with the right strategy.\xa0', '“Sure, the easy money has been made in a couple of sectors — mostly tech — but now it’s time for a bunch of other sectors to shine, the economically sensitive ones that were supposed to be crushed by an inevitable recession. These stocks aren’t liked. May I suggest you cotton to them because the plane has landed, our seatbelts are unbuckled, we’re going down the gangway, calling an Uber and getting the heck out of the airport.”', 'Cramer has also recently criticized the Federal Trade Commission for hurting stock portfolios by limiting merger and acquisition activity. On December 18, he described Lina Khan, the chief of the FTC, as a one-woman wrecking crew for stock portfolios. Cramer warned that by not letting smaller firms merge with big ones, the bigger firm would end up being hurt and the smaller one might go bankrupt. Cramer noted that merger and acquisition activity at the stock market actually created healthier competition overall.\xa0', '“Lina Khan wants to stop corporate consolidation, yet she’s created a situation where only the largest, wealthiest companies can afford all the litigation that now comes with making acquisitions.”', 'Some of the recent additions to the Jim Cramer stock portfolio include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). Cramer has been especially bullish on firms like Alphabet because of the AI growth catalysts on offer. He recently said, “Generative artificial intelligence can pretty much do whatever it wants, anything we want it to, and if we don’t ask it, another enterprise will and that competitor will get the answer faster and better than we can arrive at it, which is why everybody is ordering all this stuff”.', 'Our Methodology', 'The stocks on which Jim Cramer has recently been bullish on were selected for the list. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN) operates in the aerospace, defense, medical, and industrial markets. Jim Cramer was bullish on Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN) during the Lightning Round of his show on December 11, saying, “Why doesn’t anyone talk about this stock? It’s got a terrific aerospace business. I really like it. I’ve got to tell you, it’s dirt cheap when it comes to what it can earn, not what it’s earning right now”.', 'Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm GAMCO Investors is a leading shareholder in Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN)) with 2.4 million shares worth more than $48 million.\xa0', 'Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) markets tools and storage for industrial users. Jim Cramer has been bullish on Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in recent weeks, recommending the stock to members of his prestigious investing club on CNBC.\xa0', 'Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm Kensico Capital is a leading shareholder in Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) with 658,200 shares worth more than $55 million.\xa0', 'In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Appleseed Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic (MDT), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Stanley Black & Decker is the world’s largest tool manufacturer. It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners, and other industrial equipment. 2022 was quite a forgettable year for the Company with its stock price falling by roughly 60%. Due to supply chain issues, bloated inventories, inflationary pressures, and weaker demand, the Company badly missed its original 2022 guidance. With recessionary fears, waning earnings momentum, a more elevated leverage profile, and reliance on the U.S. construction market, it is of no surprise how poorly the stock price behaved last year. In our view, the sell-off has been excessive with the stock price trading near March 2020 pandemic lows and at levels otherwise not seen since early 2014. We view the stock at washed-out levels with a favorable profile going forward.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19', 'InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) operates as a global research and development company with focus primarily on wireless, visual, and related technologies. Jim Cramer has been bullish on InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC), recently saying, “I’ve know these guys for a long time. They are a premier digital wireless company, and I think it’s still inexpensive. I can’t believe that it’s still at these low prices”.\xa0', 'At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $188 million in InterDigital, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IDCC) is a research and development organization that develops and acquires wireless and video patents across key technologies. The company has a history of strong financial performance, opportunistically buys back shares, and pays a modest dividend.

During the lightning round of his show on December 11, Cramer was bullish on AeroVironment, Inc. (NYSE:AVAV), saying, “AeroVironment I thought had a very good quarter, I think it was profit-taking. I think that their drone business is terrific, and Mr. Nawabi is just doing a terrific job. So I would be a buyer of the stock”.\xa0', 'At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 21 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $192 million in AeroVironment, Inc.

This isn't surprising. Whenever there's a new technology, it's natural to see investors clamor to figure out who the winners will be. Now that consumer-facing products utilize generative AI models like ChatGPT and Bard, the race is on to see what stocks will be winners in this new world of AI."", ""But AI was around long before 2023 and many companies have been focusing on AI for years, making their use cases less unknown than some newer AI-focused start-ups. However, there are also many companies suddenly talking about AI when in reality it's not a material part of their business."", ""Let's take a look at three stocks with true long-term AI tailwinds that make them great stocks to buy and hold."", 'The conversation needs to start with chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The AI mania surrounding Nvidia began when the company reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings (ended July 30, 2023). Total revenue, which was expected to be $11 billion, came in at $14 billion. This represented a year-over-year increase of 101%. This surprise in total revenue was driven by data center revenue, which increased by 171%. The data center growth was a result of chips needed for large tech companies to power their generative AI efforts. The good news for Nvidia has continued from there.', ""This trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, with total revenue expected to increase by more than 200% year over year. As exciting as this has been for Nvidia shareholders, potential investors may want to exercise some patience. Nvidia stock is priced as if this growth will never slow. The stock trades for 66 times trailing earnings. There's a chance that the growth continues enough to make an investment today work out, but it may be prudent to wait a bit until the stock cools off a bit more."", ""This is a cyclical industry and it's likely better valuations will present themselves in the future. Even if the AI hype wears off, Nvidia has a diversified business and has seen massive success in other areas like gaming and automotive. This company is poised for success in the long run."", ""As mentioned earlier, the AI buzz started when ChatGPT was launched for consumers in November 2022. ChatGPT was developed by a private company called OpenAI, but tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a significant investor in OpenAI. While the billions of dollars it provided to the company doesn't give Microsoft any ownership of OpenAI, it does smooth the way for ChatGPT to be integrated into Microsoft products. The first example of this is Microsoft's browser, Bing. However, the company plans to integrate generative AI into multiple products."", ""If the promise of AI pans out, this could be a significant development for a company like Microsoft, which has a massive market share with products like Microsoft Word and Excel. Adding AI to these products could make them more attractive and sticky for users. There's been an impact on Microsoft's Azure Cloud business as its customers increase demand for AI services."", ""Microsoft currently trades at a premium valuation of 36 times trailing earnings, above the market average and the company's historical multiple. That said, the company does seem to have a lead in the AI space so some premium is to be expected."", ""Not to be left out, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has developed its own generative AI product, Bard. The parent company of Google is integrating Bard into several of its products like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Maps. If the promise of AI is to be believed, there is room for several winners in this space, and it's easy to imagine a world where Alphabet has AI fully integrated into its products. This could help the company maintain its dominant market position in the future."", ""Luckily for investors, there are plenty of things to like about Alphabet's businesses even without AI. Google is by far the leader in search while YouTube plays a dominant role in online. Its cloud infrastructure platform Google Cloud grew revenue by 22% in Q3 2024. These business segments have helped Alphabet's stock increase by 56% in 2023."", ""Even better for potential investors is the fact that Alphabet still trades for a reasonable valuation. The company's price-to-earnings multiple of 27 is only slightly above the S&P 500's multiple of 25 and still below Alphabet's historical average of 30."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

But dig deeper, and you'll realize that the gains almost entirely come from a knockout performance from three massive sectors: technology, communications, and consumer discretionary."", ""Here's what you need to know about each sector and whether it's a buy for 2024."", 'The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLC), and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLY) are three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do an excellent job mirroring the performance of their respective sectors.', 'As you can see in the above chart, all three sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 year to date. Combined, they make up a staggering 48.4% of the S&P 500, which illustrates the impact these sectors can have on the market.', 'Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term, ""Magnificent Seven"", to describe the seven stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). It\'s often thought of as referring to technology stocks.', 'In reality, Meta and Alphabet make up about 47% of the SPDR communications sector index, Amazon and Tesla make up about 41% of the consumer discretionary sector index, while Apple and Microsoft make up nearly 45% of the tech sector index, with Nvidia contributing another 4.5%.', ""The takeaway is that all three of these sectors are heavily influenced by the Magnificent Seven. And because the Magnificent Seven stocks are all outperforming this year, it makes sense that communications, consumer discretionary, and tech are outpacing the market's gains."", 'One of the reasons the tech sector continues to outperform the broader indexes is its structure. Out of all the sectors in the stock market, tech stands out as striking a nice balance between proven cash cows and exciting high-growth companies.', ""Apple and Microsoft anchor the sector. Despite trading at a premium to the market, these stocks aren't terribly expensive. They have plenty of cash flows to pay dividends, buy back their own stock, and invest in growth. Then, you have some massive, high-octane growth stocks like Nvidia that are going to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'The tech sector features a nice blend of consumer-facing and business-focused companies, enterprise software from companies like Adobe and Salesforce, and chip companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Intel.', ""The two biggest downsides of tech are its valuation and its cyclicality. Tech investment and growth are heavily dependent on the broader economy, which makes sense given tech is (by far) the most important sector in the U.S. stock market. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the tech sector, according to the SPDR sector fund, is 35.7. That's quite the premium compared to the overall market, represented by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY), which clocks in a P/E ratio of 23.3."", ""Overall, tech is arguably the highest-quality sector in the entire market. But for it to do well in 2024, earnings have to grow because it's hard to see the sector trading at a 40 or 50 P/E ratio."", ""Consumer discretionary is interesting because there are a lot of different themes at play. Unlike Apple and Microsoft, which are two massive tech stocks with some overlap and very similar capital allocation strategies, the two largest companies in the consumer discretionary sector are very different and have virtually no overlap. That's basically the theme across the sector."", ""The top five largest companies are Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's, Home Depot, and Nike -- five completely different companies in five different industries."", ""The advantage of the consumer discretionary sector is that it has more variety than other sectors. McDonald's and Home Depot are dividend-paying value stocks, not growth stocks like Tesla and Amazon. Even Nike is long past its torrid growth rate and is more so a balance between growth, value, and income at this point."", 'Like tech, consumer discretionary is highly cyclical and volatile. This sector is a better value than tech, with a 27.1 P/E ratio.', 'Communications is by far one of the strangest sectors in the stock market. It blends telecommunications (high-yield dividend giants like AT&T and Verizon Communications) with legacy media companies and cable providers, streaming companies, and social media.', 'It gets tricky when you consider Alphabet owns Google Cloud, which has little to do with communications and is more tech focused, just as Amazon Web Services falls under consumer discretionary by default when the subsidiary on its own should be in the tech sector.', 'At the end of 2022, I predicted that the communications sector would dominate 2023 largely because Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) were so beaten down, along with other top holdings in the sector.', 'But going into 2024, I think this is a sector where investors are better off selecting individual stocks based on what they are targeting instead of buying the whole sector. After all, Meta Platforms is one of the best-performing stocks in the whole S&P 500 this year. And some folks may prefer Microsoft as a better overall AI play than Alphabet, while others may prefer to pick Netflix or Disney instead of buying both.', 'The sector sports a P/E ratio of 26.4, but the valuations of its top holdings vary wildly depending on the industry.', ""December is the perfect time to reflect on what moved the market this year and what may move the market next year. It's also a good time to recall the importance of individual stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven, and their effect on the overall market and certain sectors."", ""In terms of buying a sector for next year, I'd say technology stands the best chance at outperforming the S&P 500, consumer discretionary is still a solid overall value and would be the best foundational investment for building a diversified portfolio, and communications is probably the worst of the three to buy outright, but has some compelling turnaround opportunities, particularly in Disney."", ""However, it's important to understand that all three sectors underwent massive run-ups in 2023 and could stall out in the short term, which is why it's best to invest with at least a three- to five-year time frame to avoid the fortune (or misfortune) that results from whatever the market is feeling at the time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn’t one of them.

But dig deeper, and you'll realize that the gains almost entirely come from a knockout performance from three massive sectors: technology, communications, and consumer discretionary."", ""Here's what you need to know about each sector and whether it's a buy for 2024."", 'The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLC), and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLY) are three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do an excellent job mirroring the performance of their respective sectors.', 'As you can see in the above chart, all three sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 year to date. Combined, they make up a staggering 48.4% of the S&P 500, which illustrates the impact these sectors can have on the market.', 'Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term, ""Magnificent Seven"", to describe the seven stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). It\'s often thought of as referring to technology stocks.', 'In reality, Meta and Alphabet make up about 47% of the SPDR communications sector index, Amazon and Tesla make up about 41% of the consumer discretionary sector index, while Apple and Microsoft make up nearly 45% of the tech sector index, with Nvidia contributing another 4.5%.', ""The takeaway is that all three of these sectors are heavily influenced by the Magnificent Seven. And because the Magnificent Seven stocks are all outperforming this year, it makes sense that communications, consumer discretionary, and tech are outpacing the market's gains."", 'One of the reasons the tech sector continues to outperform the broader indexes is its structure. Out of all the sectors in the stock market, tech stands out as striking a nice balance between proven cash cows and exciting high-growth companies.', ""Apple and Microsoft anchor the sector. Despite trading at a premium to the market, these stocks aren't terribly expensive. They have plenty of cash flows to pay dividends, buy back their own stock, and invest in growth. Then, you have some massive, high-octane growth stocks like Nvidia that are going to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'The tech sector features a nice blend of consumer-facing and business-focused companies, enterprise software from companies like Adobe and Salesforce, and chip companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Intel.', ""The two biggest downsides of tech are its valuation and its cyclicality. Tech investment and growth are heavily dependent on the broader economy, which makes sense given tech is (by far) the most important sector in the U.S. stock market. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the tech sector, according to the SPDR sector fund, is 35.7. That's quite the premium compared to the overall market, represented by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY), which clocks in a P/E ratio of 23.3."", ""Overall, tech is arguably the highest-quality sector in the entire market. But for it to do well in 2024, earnings have to grow because it's hard to see the sector trading at a 40 or 50 P/E ratio."", ""Consumer discretionary is interesting because there are a lot of different themes at play. Unlike Apple and Microsoft, which are two massive tech stocks with some overlap and very similar capital allocation strategies, the two largest companies in the consumer discretionary sector are very different and have virtually no overlap. That's basically the theme across the sector."", ""The top five largest companies are Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's, Home Depot, and Nike -- five completely different companies in five different industries."", ""The advantage of the consumer discretionary sector is that it has more variety than other sectors.

Wall Street hasn't been as kind. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) -- operator of the world's most popular gated attractions -- has seen its shares lose to the market with a meager 6% advance in 2023."", ""SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE: SEAS) has fared even worse. The largest publicly traded pure play in the theme parks space has tumbled 5% this year through Thursday's close. Universal Studios parent Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) is the lone market beater with its 30% year-to-date gain, but that is largely the result of record profitability for its larger bread-and-butter broadband connectivity business. Theme parks accounts for less than 10% of Comcast's revenue. In a year that was generally kind to travel and tourism stocks, 2023 was not a good one for theme park investors."", ""The ride isn't over for Disney, SeaWorld, or Comcast. All three of the leading theme park operators aren't shying away from stepping up their efforts to grow their empires despite the industry's mostly uninspiring 2023 performance. Let's take a look at what went wrong in 2023 and what could go right in 2024 and beyond."", ""Disney, SeaWorld, and Comcast may have carved different stock charts in 2023, but they all experienced disappointment in their largest theme park market: Florida. The Sunshine State is home to Disney World, Universal Orlando, and five of SeaWorld's attractions. Florida played a starring role when theme parks opened through June and July of 2020, nearly a year before its California sister parks were allowed to open following the pandemic."", ""Guests didn't flinch at the higher post-pandemic admission prices, and theme park operators thrived through 2021, 2022, and early 2023. Revenue was able to return to record levels despite turnstile clicks still well below the pre-pandemic peak. By 2022 Disney was saying that average revenue per guest was up 40% from where it was in 2019. Operating profits also hit fresh high-water marks."", ""Central Florida experienced a slowdown in the springtime of this year. The guest fatigue was unique, as all three operators held up better in California and overseas. The conclusion of Disney's 18-month celebration of the resort turning 50 at the end of March cooled tourist activity in the area. Disney, SeaWorld, and Comcast would go on to open two new roller-coasters and a moving walkway next-gen shooting gallery attraction in the springtime but they failed to draw summertime crowds. The climate is starting to pick up again now, and it's not the only reason the stocks could bounce back in 2024."", 'A lot has happened in the closing months of 2023. Earlier this week we saw Comcast confirm the purchase of a large tract of land in the U.K. as it explores opening its first park in Europe. SeaWorld recently filed plans to build a 504-room hotel at SeaWorld Orlando, finally turning its most visited attraction into a resort destination. Disney announced in late September that it was nearly doubling the capital expenditures at its theme parks to $60 billion over the next 10 years.', ""These aren't moves by companies concerned about their stock price movements in 2023. Comcast has momentum, and now it has a new potential project to work on after introducing the Epic Universe attraction in Orlando come 2025. Disney is in the process of paring back expenses across its content and networks divisions, but it's not going to relinquish its lead in the theme park market. SeaWorld is finally living up to its promise of thinking more like its larger rivals by offering on-site lodging."", ""These are investments that won't bear immediate fruit in 2024. However, as long as the global economy doesn't tank in the coming year -- and signs are starting to suggest that things may work out just fine on that front -- investors and theme park enthusiasts alike may flock back into theme parks in the coming year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

The World Economic Forum has highlighted that approximately 90% of the goods circulating across the globe are transported through maritime channels. This statistic unveils the pivotal role played by sea-based transportation in sustaining international trade and supply chains."", 'The COVID-19 pandemic brought attention to shipping stocks, usually not in the spotlight. Investors saw firsthand how vital marine shipping is for the global economy during this time. This significant surge during the pandemic was because people turned to online shopping platforms. This increased demand for high-value items like home appliances and electronics. As a result, logistics companies, responsible for transporting goods from manufacturers to stores and residences, saw a rise in their revenues due to this heightened demand. From around mid-March to October 2020, amid the peak of global pandemic restrictions, the largest shipping firms worldwide collectively increased their market value by more than $23 billion, as reported by Forbes.', ""That said, regular supply chains faced major disruptions during the pandemic, causing many of the world's large cargo ships and containers to be in the wrong places when a sudden surge in demand occurred. With people confined to their homes and unable to spend on experiences, they turned to purchasing goods instead. This unexpected shift overwhelmed the shipping industry, as it wasn't prepared for such a rapid increase in shipping needs. However, even amid these disruptions, shipping stocks continued to play a vital role in the global economy. In 2021, the total value of global trade reached an astonishing $28.5 trillion. A substantial portion of this immense cargo movement was facilitated by publicly traded shipping companies, underlining their significant contribution to global trade and commerce despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. In addition to this, between 2021 and 2022, the largest carriers made a combined net income of $364 billion, a stark change after a decade of minimal profits according to data from industry expert John McCown."", ""In a recent development, shipping stocks experienced a global increase in value. This rise was fueled by anticipated disruptions in Red Sea routes due to militant attacks, which were expected to lead to higher charges for transporting goods via ocean containers. These potential price hikes offered a glimmer of relief for investors who had witnessed a year of lackluster performance in the sector. Following the pandemic, freight rates declined as the initial surge in demand for tangible products subsided, and the logistical challenges related to Covid gradually improved. Compounding these challenges was the adverse impact of elevated global interest rates, further adding to the sector's woes.

Initially considered an unfamiliar concept, economists came to recognize the reality of stagflation following the 'Great Inflation' of the 1970s. This phenomenon revealed that, contrary to the conventional expectation of unemployment and inflation moving in opposite directions, stagflation can adversely impact an economy. Daniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, describes stagflation as:"", '""Stagflation is difficult to tackle from a policy perspective, as actions that counteract inflation (i.e., higher interest rates, decreasing the money supply) may exacerbate the level of unemployment and slow the economy further.

Consequently, the share prices of such companies often demonstrate resilience despite a slowing macroeconomic environment. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors typically exhibit a market beta of under 1, indicating outperformance when the benchmark index declines. On the other hand, cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, signaling underperformance when the index falls. Defensive sectors that perform well in stagflation economies include utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate. Conversely, cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials may face challenges during such economic conditions.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestment plans and performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', ""Investing in dividend stocks is often seen as a game for patient investors because it typically yields better returns over the long haul. The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), \xa0The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and\xa0AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best DRIP stocks to own due to their robust track records of dividend growth and stability.

If you want to read about some more Cramer stocks, go directly to Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions.\xa0', 'Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC, is one of the most well-known finance personalities on television. He has gained an ardent fan following over the past few decades through his stock recommendations to viewers. Recently, the journalist investor has been outlining his thoughts on recession fears, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the policies of the US government on mergers and acquisitions. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who returned more than 20% to investors annually for more than ten years.\xa0', 'On December 13, Cramer lauded the decision of the central bank to keep interest rates steady for the next few months, describing it as a win for the bulls at the stock market. Cramer was of the view that the Fed had already achieved a soft landing for the US economy, predicting that many sectors would soar as the pace of growth picked up once again. Cramer stressed that even though interest rates might start coming down, investors could still make money from cyclical sectors with the right strategy.\xa0', '“Sure, the easy money has been made in a couple of sectors — mostly tech — but now it’s time for a bunch of other sectors to shine, the economically sensitive ones that were supposed to be crushed by an inevitable recession. These stocks aren’t liked. May I suggest you cotton to them because the plane has landed, our seatbelts are unbuckled, we’re going down the gangway, calling an Uber and getting the heck out of the airport.”', 'Cramer has also recently criticized the Federal Trade Commission for hurting stock portfolios by limiting merger and acquisition activity. On December 18, he described Lina Khan, the chief of the FTC, as a one-woman wrecking crew for stock portfolios. Cramer warned that by not letting smaller firms merge with big ones, the bigger firm would end up being hurt and the smaller one might go bankrupt. Cramer noted that merger and acquisition activity at the stock market actually created healthier competition overall.\xa0', '“Lina Khan wants to stop corporate consolidation, yet she’s created a situation where only the largest, wealthiest companies can afford all the litigation that now comes with making acquisitions.”', 'Some of the recent additions to the Jim Cramer stock portfolio include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). Cramer has been especially bullish on firms like Alphabet because of the AI growth catalysts on offer.

To skip our detailed analysis of the gas and energy sectors, go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks.', 'The energy sector is once more a focal point on the global stage as we approach the end of 2023. This renewed attention is driven by the COP28 climate conference held in Dubai, where governments from nearly every corner of the world reached a climate agreement following two weeks of intensive negotiations. The past couple of years have been marked by significant shifts for participants and investors in the natural gas and oil industry, especially as global demand rebounded in 2022, nearly two years after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'Focusing specifically on natural gas, the United States has witnessed a significant increase in natural gas production since the advent of the fracking boom in the mid-2000s. In October, U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers significantly increased exports to 7.92 million metric tons, marking the second-highest monthly level on record. Although slightly below the record of 8.01 million metric tons in April, the October figures showed an increase from 7.12 million metric tons in September, when plant maintenance led to a reduction in U.S. production. Europe remained the primary recipient of U.S. LNG, accounting for 60% of all exports last month—an increase of 8 percentage points. Asian customers constituted 20% of exports, down from 30% in September, while Latin America received 5% of cargo, down from 8% in the previous month.', ""According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the introduction of LNG supplies from new export projects, both those that came online this year and those scheduled to start service this winter, combined with increased output at existing facilities, particularly in the United States, is expected to contribute to balancing global natural gas markets. With Europe's natural gas storage inventories full at the commencement of the 2023–24 winter season, the EIA anticipates that, barring extreme weather conditions, there will be less demand for natural gas heating in Europe and limited growth in demand from Asia compared to previous years."", 'Despite facing downward pressure from various factors, natural gas is anticipated to continue playing a significant role in the energy industry until renewable energy fully displaces fossil fuels. The current low prices are impacting natural gas stocks, leading to a decline in their market values. Seizing this opportunity, investors may want to keep an eye on some of the most profitable natural gas stocks, which include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for potential investment.', 'A sunset view of an oil and gas refinery located in the San Juan Basin, United States.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the most profitable renewable natural gas stocks, we narrowed down a list of energy companies that have operations involving natural gas, and ranked them according to their lates trailing twelve month net income.

(NASDAQ:MU) came out with a strong set of quarterly numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. Micron Technology beat expectations with revenues of US$4.7b arriving 2.0% ahead of forecasts. The company also reported a statutory loss of US$1.12, 2.2% smaller than was expected. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Micron Technology ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Micron Technology's 36 analysts is for revenues of US$23.0b in 2024. This reflects a sizeable 42% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 85% to US$0.95. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$22.2b and losses of US$1.80 per share in 2024. There's been a pretty noticeable increase in sentiment, with the analysts upgrading revenues and making a considerable decrease in loss per share in particular."", 'It will come as no surprise to learn thatthe analysts have increased their price target for Micron Technology 11% to US$92.26on the back of these upgrades. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Micron Technology at US$140 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$65.30. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.', ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that Micron Technology is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to display 60% annualised growth until the end of 2024. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 3.4% annual decline over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 16% per year. Not only are Micron Technology's revenues expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are also expecting it to grow faster than the wider industry."", 'The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.', 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

This is a sector that has performed exceptionally well coming out of the pandemic, thanks partly to upended supply chains and efforts to ""reshore"" production. While the stock has been a strong performer, the dividend story hasn\'t been nearly as attractive. So, is Stag a buy or not? It depends.', ""The biggest company in the industrial real estate sector is Prologis (NYSE: PLD), a REIT that has a global footprint, a warehouse focus, and locations in most of the world's important transportation hubs. Where Prologis doesn't compete is in secondary markets. In fact, most industrial REITs don't operate in secondary markets, which is one of the main reasons why Stag invests in such markets."", 'Essentially, as a public REIT, Stag has relatively easy access to capital, helping to keep its investment costs below those of small mom-and-pop investors that typically dominate secondary markets. That gives it the ability to select some of the best assets that house some of the most attractive tenants. At the end of the third quarter, the REIT had over 560 properties across 41 states.', ""The key number, however, is rent growth. In Q3, Stag was able to increase rents on expiring leases by a huge 54%. The reason for this is that older leases are ending and they are being marked up to current market rates. Coming out of the early COVID-19 period, demand for industrial space rose, pushing market rates higher in a big way. It will likely take years for Stag's entire portfolio to roll over to the higher lease rates, so that outsize rental growth is likely to continue. This is the good news that has helped to push the stock higher this year, outperforming the gain of the average REIT, using the Vanguard Real Estate Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) as a proxy."", ""COVID arrived in a big way in 2020 and the world is now about to enter 2024 having largely grown accustomed to dealing with the illness, so this story isn't new. Given that REITs like Stag are designed to be income stocks, you might expect that the dividend has been growing strongly as the business has prospered. But that isn't what has happened."", ""Over the trailing one-, three-, and five-year periods, the dividend has increased less than 1% a year on an annualized basis. That's pretty miserly any way you look at it, and this rate of growth doesn't even keep up with the historical growth rate of inflation. It looks even worse when you compare Stag to Prologis, which has boosted its dividend 13% over the past year, 14% annualized over the trailing three years, and 12% annualized over the past five years."", ""If you are looking for dividend growth, you'll be better off with a different industrial REIT given Stag's recent history. But there's some nuance here. Stag's dividend yield is currently around 3.8%, which is more than a full percentage point higher than Prologis' 2.6% yield. While neither of those yields is particularly huge, if you are looking for an industrial REIT and want to maximize the income your portfolio generates today, Stag looks like it could be the better choice."", ""There is no such thing as a perfect investment, with investors having to weigh many different pros and cons with each buy and sell decision. Stag's business looks like it is well positioned today, but that's not unique in the industrial REIT sector. That said, it has a notably higher yield than industry bellwether Prologis. Still, dividend growth has been relatively poor. All told, if you want to own an industrial REIT, Stag seems most appropriate for income investors that need as much income as possible today. If you are looking for rapid dividend growth, you are likely to be disappointed by Stag."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Stag Industrial right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Stag Industrial, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Stag Industrial wasn't one of them.

But I think long-term investors need to look at a company like this, invest with Warren Buffett, I think you'll be just fine."", ""JARED BLIKRE: All right, how does investing with Warren Buffett go wrong? I'm seeing the recession, the big R-word right there."", 'ROBERT SCHEIN: Yeah, exactly what we just described is the recession risk moving forward.', ""JARED BLIKRE: All right, well, let's move on because at the other side of the scale, we have Lucid Group. This is one stock that you're avoiding. Just look at the chart here we've had. It's been very volatile. And I think from the ultimate highs, it's down just an incredible percentage."", ""ROBERT SCHEIN: Yeah, this one's a good buy, meaning we don't own it. We've never owned it for clients. Again, we like the energy space."", ""The EV space, this is a tough one. Right now, even if you look at the stock, there's a lot of negative news surrounding it. Number one, the CFO jumped, you know, unexpectedly earlier in the last month."", ""We also have the same time, the EV slowdown that you're seeing. And so the production, sort of, Lucid, right, they were going to deliver 10,000 units and they had to walk that back to about 8,500. So now they're also not beating or meeting to their expectations."", 'JARED BLIKRE: And we got the burn rate.', ""ROBERT SCHEIN: And their cash burn rate, they could be out of cash within a year this time next year. Ultimately, the Saudi government is their backer at $1.8 billion earlier this year, but how long does that last? And again, your competitor, your last to the party. It could be a great product, if you will, but it's not a great stock to own. And that's one of the things where if you've got Tesla, the 800-pound gorilla really hanging out there, it's going to be hard to keep track."", ""And then the CFO even said, hey, listen-- or the CEO said, listen, we don't have the entry level in play until 2030. So that's also going to help them if the consumer is hit and they're still looking for the EV space. They still have to stretch high for the Lucid high-end cars. So for 2024, it's a good buy."", 'JARED BLIKRE: All right, now how does this reverse to the upside here? How does Lucid become a good potential buy?', ""ROBERT SCHEIN: Well, you did see a little bit of reversal in the last few weeks and it's short covering."", 'JARED BLIKRE: Yeah.', ""ROBERT SCHEIN: Right, and so, again, if you're in that space and you like, sort of, thinly-traded markets with regards to maybe areas where people just pile in and try to drive up the stock for the day."", 'JARED BLIKRE: So short-term punter maybe, but not for the longer term.', ""ROBERT SCHEIN: It's not for the faint of heart and it's not for the true investor. If you're a serious investor, you're going to look towards other sectors and other higher quality companies."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Well, if the only thing I can think of to turn a company around is a short covering rally and perhaps more government handouts, I don't know about that one. But to recap, all right, you're telling investors to buy Occidental Petroleum. That's based on the stock's attractive valuation, the reward potential, and supply chain and inflation headwinds turning into tailwinds in the new year."", ""And on the other side here, you're saying avoid Lucid Group because of its weak financials, its cash burn, and potential difficulties facing the entire EV industry.

To skip our detailed analysis of the gas and energy sectors, go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks.', 'The energy sector is once more a focal point on the global stage as we approach the end of 2023. This renewed attention is driven by the COP28 climate conference held in Dubai, where governments from nearly every corner of the world reached a climate agreement following two weeks of intensive negotiations. The past couple of years have been marked by significant shifts for participants and investors in the natural gas and oil industry, especially as global demand rebounded in 2022, nearly two years after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'Focusing specifically on natural gas, the United States has witnessed a significant increase in natural gas production since the advent of the fracking boom in the mid-2000s. In October, U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers significantly increased exports to 7.92 million metric tons, marking the second-highest monthly level on record. Although slightly below the record of 8.01 million metric tons in April, the October figures showed an increase from 7.12 million metric tons in September, when plant maintenance led to a reduction in U.S. production. Europe remained the primary recipient of U.S. LNG, accounting for 60% of all exports last month—an increase of 8 percentage points. Asian customers constituted 20% of exports, down from 30% in September, while Latin America received 5% of cargo, down from 8% in the previous month.', ""According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the introduction of LNG supplies from new export projects, both those that came online this year and those scheduled to start service this winter, combined with increased output at existing facilities, particularly in the United States, is expected to contribute to balancing global natural gas markets. With Europe's natural gas storage inventories full at the commencement of the 2023–24 winter season, the EIA anticipates that, barring extreme weather conditions, there will be less demand for natural gas heating in Europe and limited growth in demand from Asia compared to previous years."", 'Despite facing downward pressure from various factors, natural gas is anticipated to continue playing a significant role in the energy industry until renewable energy fully displaces fossil fuels.

Over the past three years, its share price has fallen by 83% as it abandoned parts of its pipeline and laid off staff. Despite its supposedly powerful gene-editing technology, the company is struggling to advance its clinical programs to the point where they might be commercialized and generate revenue."", 'Thankfully for Editas shareholders, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) just gave the business a much-needed break -- one that might even portend a brighter future for the stock.', ""Per the agreement announced on Dec. 13, Vertex will non-exclusively license Editas' Cas-9 gene-editing technology for its applications in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, a pair of hereditary blood disorders. The license explicitly applies to Vertex's near-curative gene therapy for sickle cell disease, Casgevy, which it developed in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, and which earned Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on Dec. 8. The FDA is scheduled to make a decision on Casgevy's approval as a treatment for beta-thalassemia by the end of March."", ""The licensing deal's financial impact is significant for Editas. Vertex will pay $50 million in cash up front, an additional $50 million after reaching certain undisclosed contingencies, and the potential for between $10 million and $40 million per year in licensing fees from now through 2034, when Editas' patent for the gene-editing technology expires. According to its latest earnings release, at the end of Q3, Editas had $446 million in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, which management thought was enough to last it through approximately Q3 2025. Now, it expects to be able to keep the lights on through the start of 2026."", ""It'll need that extra time, but it might not be enough on its own. The biotech has only two clinical-stage candidates -- a gene therapy for sickle cell disease, and a gene therapy for beta-thalassemia. Both are in early-stage clinical trials, and it will be years before regulators might consider them for approval, if they ever do. What's more, even if both its programs get approved for sale, they'll be years behind Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics' efforts to penetrate the same market. And that's before taking into account the fact that Bluebird Bio is also already commercializing its gene therapies for those same two illnesses. As the therapies produced by all three are intended to provide a functional cure (or nearly so) for the conditions with a single treatment, the market might have shrunk significantly by the time an Editas treatment arrives."", ""The good news for Editas shareholders is that the licensing arrangement with Vertex is an unmistakable signal that the company's peers find its intellectual property to be highly valuable. Or, perhaps Vertex sees its patents as broad and defensible enough that it would be legally risky to develop anything using the same gene-editing technologies without paying the toll first. Either of those explanations would be positive for the prospects of Editas because they both imply that more licensing revenue is likely to be on the way."", ""Even before signing the deal with Vertex, management was signaling that similar business development arrangements were in the works. In August, Editas entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Vor Biopharma, centered around using its gene-editing methods to develop cell therapy medicines to treat blood cancers. Now, other companies could soon show interest, especially with a powerful player like Vertex Pharmaceuticals publicly leasing the rights to use Editas' IP. That could set the stock up for additional catalyst events over the next couple of years, which would help the company to keep the lights on for longer."", ""The catch is that Editas' stock is unlikely to be a star performer based on licensing deals alone. They may generate recurring revenue, but few biotechs can survive long term on the basis of their licensing revenue. Without programs backed by strong clinical data and a credible shot at grabbing decent-size shares of their target markets, it will be hard to convince investors to bid up the price of its shares."", ""Of course, with enough valuable technology, and with enough hustling from the company's business development staff, it might still be possible. But until there's more evidence that such an approach will be sustainable for Editas, investors should only count on licensing deals to provide a trickle of income. Therefore, investors should also expect the stock to remain a risky investment, even if it's a bit less risky now than it was before Vertex signed on."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Editas Medicine right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Editas Medicine, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Editas Medicine wasn't one of them.

One particular choice, though, could actually grow that money into a whole lot more. I'm talking about investing. If you invest in a variety of solid companies over time -- at least five years -- you could see the amount of your bonus multiply."", ""So, which stocks should you choose? It's a great idea to go with companies that have demonstrated earnings strength over time -- and remain leaders in their markets so they may continue growing earnings into the future. You also should consider stocks that pay dividends, to offer you passive income every year. Finally, you'll want to look at valuation and choose stocks that are reasonably priced right now."", ""Ready to get started? Let's check out five top stocks that could grow your bonus over the long run if you buy today."", 'Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a healthcare giant with four solid businesses: diagnostics, medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, and nutrition. This is a plus because if one day a particular business faces headwinds, the other units may compensate.', ""Here's a recent example: During earlier days of the pandemic, Abbott's leadership in coronavirus testing brought in billions of dollars, but today, testing demand is on the decline. Still, the company's strength in other areas helped it generate double-digit sales growth in the third quarter -- and report $10 billion in sales. Excluding coronavirus testing, each of the four units reported double-digit sales increases."", ""You'll also like Abbott for its dividend growth. As a Dividend King, it's lifted its payment for more than 50 consecutive years. That suggests rewarding shareholders is important to the company so it's likely to continue on that path."", 'Today, Abbott shares trade for 24 times forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable price for this blend of passive income and earnings strength.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is another Dividend King that you'll want to add to your portfolio. The company has the free cash flow -- at more than $10 billion -- and the earnings power to support ongoing dividend increases. And, as with Abbott, it's clear this long track record of dividend growth shows the company is committed to sharing its successes with shareholders."", ""Speaking of earnings, even in tougher times, the world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker has managed to raise prices and increase revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue and net income climbed -- and the company lifted its full-year revenue forecast. This is thanks to Coca-Cola's solid brand, which serves as its moat or competitive advantage. Fans of the company's eponymous drink and its other popular brands such as Minute Maid juices keep coming back and won't easily switch to the competition."", ""Today, Coca-Cola shares trade for 21 times forward earnings estimates, a great price for this market giant that you'll want to hold on to for the long haul."", ""I've got one more Dividend King for you: healthcare powerhouse Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company, like the two above, has made dividend payments a priority and recently reiterated its commitment to dividend growth."", 'Right now is a particularly interesting time to invest in J&J because, earlier this year, the company made a major move to spur growth. J&J spun off its slower-growth consumer health business so that it can focus on its two higher-growth businesses: pharmaceuticals and medtech. It collected more than $13 billion from the operation -- that could come in handy to support internal pipeline growth or to acquire external programs.', 'J&J recently said it aims to launch more than 20 new therapies and 50 product expansions by 2030 -- and the company expects to have more than 10 products with peak year sales potential of $5 billion or more.', 'Today, J&J shares trade for 15 times forward earnings estimates, a steal for this healthcare leader as it heads into a new era of growth.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is the global market leader in cystic fibrosis treatment, bringing in billions of dollars in earnings annually. This leadership is likely to last through the late 2030s thanks to its current blockbuster, Trikafta, and potential new products on the horizon.', ""On top of this, Vertex is expanding into other areas. The company and partner CRISPR Therapeutics recently scored a win when they received regulatory approval of Casgevy, their gene-editing treatment for blood disorders. The product has blockbuster potential and also demonstrates that Vertex has what it takes to expand beyond one treatment area. And here, there's more to come. Vertex's pipeline is strong, and the company now is wrapping up a pivotal program in the very promising area of pain management."", 'Even though Vertex shares have climbed this year, the stock trades for only 26 times times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable price considering forecasts for double-digit annual growth over the coming five years.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown earnings over the years thanks to consumers' love for its must-have products like the iPhone and Mac. And this brand strength is Apple's moat -- iPhone fans are unlikely to forgo the latest version and opt for another brand. This loyalty should help the company continue to post revenue gains well into the future."", 'And this loyalty has also helped Apple create a second revenue stream beyond just selling its devices. Apple now can generate more and more revenue through sales of services to device owners. The company this year reached more than 1 billion paying subscribers, and this helped Apple report record-high services revenue in the most recent quarter. By services, I mean everything from digital content to iCloud storage.', ""Apple shares advanced this year, but they're still trading for only 30 times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable level for this top tech company as it heads into a new era of growth led by services strength."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Abbott Laboratories right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Abbott Laboratories, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Abbott Laboratories wasn't one of them.

Gene therapy is an example of just that. The market for gene therapy is worth a relatively modest $8.7 billion this year, according to estimates from Grand View Research. But those analysts also believe that by 2030, it could soar to more than $29.5 billion, if it expands at a compounded annual growth rate of 19.5%."", 'Gene therapies have significant potential, as they could give people with hard-to-treat diseases new hope. And one company that is becoming a big name in gene therapy these days is CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP). This mid-cap stock is worth over $5 billion today but has the potential to be much more valuable in the years and decades ahead. Could investing in this healthcare stock help make you a millionaire?', 'Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Casgevy, a gene therapy treatment that CRISPR has been working on with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The treatment, which has a list price of $2.2 million, can be a one-time functional cure for people with sickle cell disease. The price is so high because of how valuable it is, and how much time and money it can save the healthcare industry. It gives patients a much more promising solution, without the need for ongoing treatment.', ""CRISPR and Vertex are also hoping that the FDA approves the therapy as a treatment of transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Investors won't learn about that approval until next March, which is when the PDUFA date is set for that indication."", ""When it comes to investing in biotech stocks, the big concern for investors often relates to cash burn and the need for frequent share offerings (i.e. dilution). But now that CRISPR has an approved treatment and product in its portfolio, there is less potential risk of that. While it will have to share in the profits on Casgevy with Vertex (CRISPR gets 40%), that's still a much better situation than where the company has been before now."", ""Over the trailing 12 months, the company has incurred net losses totaling just under $416 million. While CRISPR's expenses are likely to increase as it spends more money in the commercialization of Casgevy, its financials should improve significantly."", ""Now that CRISPR has one gene therapy treatment approved, the hope is that there could be others to follow. Its pipeline features other promising treatments, including VCTX210 and VCTX211, which could transform the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. While there's no certainty that other treatments will obtain approval, there is optimism that Casgevy could just be the start for CRISPR."", ""CRISPR's stock has a lot of potential to increase in value in the future, and I could see an investment in the healthcare company eventually growing to $1 million. But it also depends on the size of your investment. Putting just $100 into the stock means you would need it to generate 10,000x returns, which isn't very likely. The more you can invest, the more probable it is that your shares will eventually grow to $1 million."", ""The bottom line is that yes, CRISPR does have the potential to be a millionaire-making investment as it's achieving success in a fast-growing industry.

It's more likely than it might seem at first glance. Here's why."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been a solid investment for a few reasons. First, it's the only company that sells therapies treating the root causes of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare hereditary lung disease. Rather than settling for producing one drug to serve the CF market, Vertex has several, some of which are repackaged combinations of its other medicines."", ""Its pipeline is packed with more therapies for CF, and it also features programs targeting other rare diseases. The appeal of such an approach is that it enables Vertex to use its institutional acumen and close relationships with the community of CF patients as a competitive advantage. And it's led that market for many years already, generating billions in earnings along the way, and $3.3 billion in net income in 2022 alone."", 'Focusing on a niche market like CF means having a lower risk of competition. It also makes the company a favorite of patients, not to mention the portions of the medical and scientific communities working on the disease.', ""So by virtue of its core strategy (and years of fruitful effort), Vertex is positioned as the go-to provider and drug developer for its customers, a prized employer for the CF field's top people, and an appealing collaborator for all manner of different biotechs working on tailored gene-therapy solutions for rare diseases. And that's a great place for it to be."", ""Sarepta's strategy is broadly similar to Vertex's, which means it could in theory follow a similar trajectory to ongoing success."", 'It focuses on developing medicines to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare and fatal hereditary disease that affects muscle cells. Its product lineup features four medicines for the condition, and its pipeline has five additional programs in preclinical and clinical trials.', ""Around 20,000 people are diagnosed with DMD each year, so there's a relatively small population of patients to treat. As the disease is degenerative and starts causing problems before patients turn 5, finding those patients and treating them quickly is a priority and a challenge."", ""But as shown by Vertex's success, small markets present opportunities for leadership that would be impossible in larger and more crowded ones. Nonetheless, from the perspective of prospective shareholders, there are a couple of things that will need to change before Sarepta can convincingly be called another Vertex."", ""The most important issue is that it isn't yet profitable. That's a problem as it calls into question the value of eventually being the master of the DMD market. In other words, if it's currently the only company making therapies that treat the root cause of DMD rather than its symptoms, and its four marketed products aren't bringing in more money than it costs to develop, manufacture, and distribute them, what's the benefit of penetrating the market further?"", ""But given that its trailing-12-month research and development (R&D) expenditures of $896 million are largely what's keeping it in the red, its unprofitability is ultimately a solvable obstacle. Ramping up revenue of its latest drug for DMD, which launched in the third quarter, could also potentially lead to profitability. Management thinks that the therapy, called Elevidys, could one day have peak revenue in excess of $4 billion yearly; that would certainly cover its latest 12-month operating expenses of $1.4 billion."", 'Another potential obstacle is that Sarepta may have more trouble expanding the approved indications of its medicines for DMD than Vertex did with CF. That would make its road map for maintaining its revenue base considerably more difficult to navigate.', ""As DMD is a degenerative disease that starts at birth and worsens over time, it's critical to intervene as early as possible. For the biotech's approved gene therapies, that has meant targeting patients under age 5. But its latest phase 3 clinical trial, which sought to test whether Elevidys could be useful in children between the ages of 4 and 7, did not meet its primary endpoint, which was based on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) scale."", ""Importantly, the treatment met its secondary endpoints, so there's still an argument for using it. Regulators may yet agree with the company's assertion that the therapy could still be helpful for the target demographic. Still, the stumble shows that Sarepta is working in a genuinely difficult area of medicine where the constraints are significant. That leaves shareholders at a high risk of paying for setbacks."", ""In the long term, it's very likely that Sarepta will become profitable, but it's also likely that it'll face continuing difficulty in expanding the labels of its medications to cheaply expand its addressable market. It has what it takes to be the next Vertex Pharmaceuticals, though it might take a bit longer than shareholders prefer. Does that mean you should buy the stock now?"", 'Not exactly. Unfortunately, one of the constants in recent years has been that investors dump the stock whenever a company experiences a less-than-ideal clinical trial result. Whether or not those shareholders are right to sell, anyone who invests today will be going along for a potentially bumpy ride.', ""Once there's a few quarters of profits on the books, investors are likely to become more accommodating to bumps in the road. So keep an eye out, and at that point think about whether to buy shares then."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Sarepta Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Sarepta Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Sarepta Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

In the meantime, an $8,000 investment in the stock would yield about $200 in yearly income starting right now."", 'Procter & Gamble typically announces its yearly dividend increase in April, but investors don\'t have to wait until then to buy this consumer staples giant.

One particular choice, though, could actually grow that money into a whole lot more. I'm talking about investing. If you invest in a variety of solid companies over time -- at least five years -- you could see the amount of your bonus multiply."", ""So, which stocks should you choose? It's a great idea to go with companies that have demonstrated earnings strength over time -- and remain leaders in their markets so they may continue growing earnings into the future. You also should consider stocks that pay dividends, to offer you passive income every year. Finally, you'll want to look at valuation and choose stocks that are reasonably priced right now."", ""Ready to get started? Let's check out five top stocks that could grow your bonus over the long run if you buy today."", 'Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a healthcare giant with four solid businesses: diagnostics, medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, and nutrition. This is a plus because if one day a particular business faces headwinds, the other units may compensate.', ""Here's a recent example: During earlier days of the pandemic, Abbott's leadership in coronavirus testing brought in billions of dollars, but today, testing demand is on the decline. Still, the company's strength in other areas helped it generate double-digit sales growth in the third quarter -- and report $10 billion in sales. Excluding coronavirus testing, each of the four units reported double-digit sales increases."", ""You'll also like Abbott for its dividend growth. As a Dividend King, it's lifted its payment for more than 50 consecutive years. That suggests rewarding shareholders is important to the company so it's likely to continue on that path."", 'Today, Abbott shares trade for 24 times forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable price for this blend of passive income and earnings strength.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is another Dividend King that you'll want to add to your portfolio. The company has the free cash flow -- at more than $10 billion -- and the earnings power to support ongoing dividend increases. And, as with Abbott, it's clear this long track record of dividend growth shows the company is committed to sharing its successes with shareholders."", ""Speaking of earnings, even in tougher times, the world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker has managed to raise prices and increase revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue and net income climbed -- and the company lifted its full-year revenue forecast. This is thanks to Coca-Cola's solid brand, which serves as its moat or competitive advantage. Fans of the company's eponymous drink and its other popular brands such as Minute Maid juices keep coming back and won't easily switch to the competition."", ""Today, Coca-Cola shares trade for 21 times forward earnings estimates, a great price for this market giant that you'll want to hold on to for the long haul."", ""I've got one more Dividend King for you: healthcare powerhouse Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company, like the two above, has made dividend payments a priority and recently reiterated its commitment to dividend growth."", 'Right now is a particularly interesting time to invest in J&J because, earlier this year, the company made a major move to spur growth. J&J spun off its slower-growth consumer health business so that it can focus on its two higher-growth businesses: pharmaceuticals and medtech.

This leadership is likely to last through the late 2030s thanks to its current blockbuster, Trikafta, and potential new products on the horizon.', ""On top of this, Vertex is expanding into other areas. The company and partner CRISPR Therapeutics recently scored a win when they received regulatory approval of Casgevy, their gene-editing treatment for blood disorders. The product has blockbuster potential and also demonstrates that Vertex has what it takes to expand beyond one treatment area. And here, there's more to come. Vertex's pipeline is strong, and the company now is wrapping up a pivotal program in the very promising area of pain management."", 'Even though Vertex shares have climbed this year, the stock trades for only 26 times times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable price considering forecasts for double-digit annual growth over the coming five years.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown earnings over the years thanks to consumers' love for its must-have products like the iPhone and Mac. And this brand strength is Apple's moat -- iPhone fans are unlikely to forgo the latest version and opt for another brand. This loyalty should help the company continue to post revenue gains well into the future."", 'And this loyalty has also helped Apple create a second revenue stream beyond just selling its devices. Apple now can generate more and more revenue through sales of services to device owners. The company this year reached more than 1 billion paying subscribers, and this helped Apple report record-high services revenue in the most recent quarter. By services, I mean everything from digital content to iCloud storage.', ""Apple shares advanced this year, but they're still trading for only 30 times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable level for this top tech company as it heads into a new era of growth led by services strength."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Abbott Laboratories right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Abbott Laboratories, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Abbott Laboratories wasn't one of them.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out\xa05 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""Stagflation is characterized by a persistent combination of elevated inflation, simultaneous peak unemployment, and sluggish demand. Initially considered an unfamiliar concept, economists came to recognize the reality of stagflation following the 'Great Inflation' of the 1970s. This phenomenon revealed that, contrary to the conventional expectation of unemployment and inflation moving in opposite directions, stagflation can adversely impact an economy. Daniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, describes stagflation as:"", '""Stagflation is difficult to tackle from a policy perspective, as actions that counteract inflation (i.e., higher interest rates, decreasing the money supply) may exacerbate the level of unemployment and slow the economy further. The three components of stagflation (high inflation, high unemployment, weak demand) have an impact on the revenue, profitability and valuation of businesses, which in turn affects the price an investor is willing to pay for a share.""', 'Until recently, Wall Street experts considered stagflation as the predominant risk for the global economy in 2023. They were of the opinion that any upswing in equity markets appeared unsustainable in the aftermath of the significant selloff in 2022. Seven months following the initial estimate of Q1 2023 GDP growth, which was subsequently revised upward by 1.1%, concerns about stagflation in the United States were alleviated by the recent Q3 2023 GDP growth estimates. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, annualized real GDP growth surged to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023, signifying the swiftest rate of expansion since Q4 2021.', ""Stagflation tends to favor defensive companies, those providing essential products and services for people's daily needs. Consequently, the share prices of such companies often demonstrate resilience despite a slowing macroeconomic environment. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors typically exhibit a market beta of under 1, indicating outperformance when the benchmark index declines. On the other hand, cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, signaling underperformance when the index falls. Defensive sectors that perform well in stagflation economies include utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate. Conversely, cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials may face challenges during such economic conditions. With that said, it’s worth noting that certain stocks, including household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), are notably more secure against periods of stagflation that others."", 'Copyright: defotoberg / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology', ""In compiling the best stagflation stocks to buy, we have chosen stocks characterized by their defensive attributes, robust market visibility, resilient dividend profiles, and a longstanding history of navigating through volatile market environments.

The shift from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled civilizations and societal advancement is primarily attributed to the ability of humans to cultivate their own food and pool resources. Of course, since then, caloric consumption worldwide has expanded significantly due to advancements in agricultural mechanization, leading to increased food production. The United Nations projects a continued growth in global caloric consumption, estimating an increase from 2,789 kilocalories per person in 2000 to 3,139 kilocalories by 2050, representing a 12% growth, as per data from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). In that regard, the food industry stands as one of the vital sectors globally and is often considered a resilient haven during economic downturns. This is because, even in challenging economic times, consumers may cut back on luxury expenses like electronics but will consistently need to purchase essential food items.', ""As we approach the end of 2023, it's noteworthy to highlight certain food items that have demonstrated resilience in the midst of economic challenges and appear to be well-positioned for the coming year. The emphasis on broadening plant-based alternatives has especially favored companies providing meat substitutes, maintaining a substantial presence in consumers' shopping preferences.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Stryker investors that purchase the stock on or after the 28th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of January."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.80 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Stryker has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current share price of $297.5.

Fortunately, it paid out only 43% of its free cash flow in the past year."", ""It's positive to see that Stryker's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Stryker has grown its earnings rapidly, up 20% a year for the past five years. Stryker is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Stryker has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", ""Is Stryker worth buying for its dividend? We love that Stryker is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow.

There's a lot to like about Stryker, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", ""While it's tempting to invest in Stryker for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

If you want to read about some more Cramer stocks, go directly to Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions.\xa0', 'Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC, is one of the most well-known finance personalities on television. He has gained an ardent fan following over the past few decades through his stock recommendations to viewers. Recently, the journalist investor has been outlining his thoughts on recession fears, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the policies of the US government on mergers and acquisitions. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who returned more than 20% to investors annually for more than ten years.\xa0', 'On December 13, Cramer lauded the decision of the central bank to keep interest rates steady for the next few months, describing it as a win for the bulls at the stock market. Cramer was of the view that the Fed had already achieved a soft landing for the US economy, predicting that many sectors would soar as the pace of growth picked up once again. Cramer stressed that even though interest rates might start coming down, investors could still make money from cyclical sectors with the right strategy.\xa0', '“Sure, the easy money has been made in a couple of sectors — mostly tech — but now it’s time for a bunch of other sectors to shine, the economically sensitive ones that were supposed to be crushed by an inevitable recession. These stocks aren’t liked. May I suggest you cotton to them because the plane has landed, our seatbelts are unbuckled, we’re going down the gangway, calling an Uber and getting the heck out of the airport.”', 'Cramer has also recently criticized the Federal Trade Commission for hurting stock portfolios by limiting merger and acquisition activity. On December 18, he described Lina Khan, the chief of the FTC, as a one-woman wrecking crew for stock portfolios. Cramer warned that by not letting smaller firms merge with big ones, the bigger firm would end up being hurt and the smaller one might go bankrupt. Cramer noted that merger and acquisition activity at the stock market actually created healthier competition overall.\xa0', '“Lina Khan wants to stop corporate consolidation, yet she’s created a situation where only the largest, wealthiest companies can afford all the litigation that now comes with making acquisitions.”', 'Some of the recent additions to the Jim Cramer stock portfolio include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). Cramer has been especially bullish on firms like Alphabet because of the AI growth catalysts on offer. He recently said, “Generative artificial intelligence can pretty much do whatever it wants, anything we want it to, and if we don’t ask it, another enterprise will and that competitor will get the answer faster and better than we can arrive at it, which is why everybody is ordering all this stuff”.', 'Our Methodology', 'The stocks on which Jim Cramer has recently been bullish on were selected for the list. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN) operates in the aerospace, defense, medical, and industrial markets. Jim Cramer was bullish on Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN) during the Lightning Round of his show on December 11, saying, “Why doesn’t anyone talk about this stock? It’s got a terrific aerospace business. I really like it. I’ve got to tell you, it’s dirt cheap when it comes to what it can earn, not what it’s earning right now”.', 'Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm GAMCO Investors is a leading shareholder in Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN)) with 2.4 million shares worth more than $48 million.\xa0', 'Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) markets tools and storage for industrial users. Jim Cramer has been bullish on Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in recent weeks, recommending the stock to members of his prestigious investing club on CNBC.\xa0', 'Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm Kensico Capital is a leading shareholder in Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) with 658,200 shares worth more than $55 million.\xa0', 'In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Appleseed Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic (MDT), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Stanley Black & Decker is the world’s largest tool manufacturer. It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners, and other industrial equipment. 2022 was quite a forgettable year for the Company with its stock price falling by roughly 60%. Due to supply chain issues, bloated inventories, inflationary pressures, and weaker demand, the Company badly missed its original 2022 guidance. With recessionary fears, waning earnings momentum, a more elevated leverage profile, and reliance on the U.S. construction market, it is of no surprise how poorly the stock price behaved last year. In our view, the sell-off has been excessive with the stock price trading near March 2020 pandemic lows and at levels otherwise not seen since early 2014. We view the stock at washed-out levels with a favorable profile going forward.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19', 'InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) operates as a global research and development company with focus primarily on wireless, visual, and related technologies. Jim Cramer has been bullish on InterDigital, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IDCC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) is a research and development organization that develops and acquires wireless and video patents across key technologies. The company has a history of strong financial performance, opportunistically buys back shares, and pays a modest dividend. Shares jumped earlier this year when InterDigital announced licensing renewals with Samsung, LG, and Panasonic and then reported strong fourth quarter 2022 results.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) designs, develops, produces, delivers, and supports a portfolio of robotic systems and related services for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. During the lightning round of his show on December 11, Cramer was bullish on AeroVironment, Inc. (NYSE:AVAV), saying, “AeroVironment I thought had a very good quarter, I think it was profit-taking. I think that their drone business is terrific, and Mr. Nawabi is just doing a terrific job. So I would be a buyer of the stock”.\xa0', 'At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 21 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $192 million in AeroVironment, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the shipping and transportation industry, and go directly to read 5 Best Shipping Stocks That Pay Dividends.\xa0', ""In today's interconnected global economy, the movement of goods across the world holds immense significance. The World Economic Forum has highlighted that approximately 90% of the goods circulating across the globe are transported through maritime channels. This statistic unveils the pivotal role played by sea-based transportation in sustaining international trade and supply chains."", 'The COVID-19 pandemic brought attention to shipping stocks, usually not in the spotlight. Investors saw firsthand how vital marine shipping is for the global economy during this time. This significant surge during the pandemic was because people turned to online shopping platforms. This increased demand for high-value items like home appliances and electronics. As a result, logistics companies, responsible for transporting goods from manufacturers to stores and residences, saw a rise in their revenues due to this heightened demand. From around mid-March to October 2020, amid the peak of global pandemic restrictions, the largest shipping firms worldwide collectively increased their market value by more than $23 billion, as reported by Forbes.', ""That said, regular supply chains faced major disruptions during the pandemic, causing many of the world's large cargo ships and containers to be in the wrong places when a sudden surge in demand occurred. With people confined to their homes and unable to spend on experiences, they turned to purchasing goods instead. This unexpected shift overwhelmed the shipping industry, as it wasn't prepared for such a rapid increase in shipping needs. However, even amid these disruptions, shipping stocks continued to play a vital role in the global economy. In 2021, the total value of global trade reached an astonishing $28.5 trillion. A substantial portion of this immense cargo movement was facilitated by publicly traded shipping companies, underlining their significant contribution to global trade and commerce despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. In addition to this, between 2021 and 2022, the largest carriers made a combined net income of $364 billion, a stark change after a decade of minimal profits according to data from industry expert John McCown."", ""In a recent development, shipping stocks experienced a global increase in value. This rise was fueled by anticipated disruptions in Red Sea routes due to militant attacks, which were expected to lead to higher charges for transporting goods via ocean containers. These potential price hikes offered a glimmer of relief for investors who had witnessed a year of lackluster performance in the sector. Following the pandemic, freight rates declined as the initial surge in demand for tangible products subsided, and the logistical challenges related to Covid gradually improved. Compounding these challenges was the adverse impact of elevated global interest rates, further adding to the sector's woes. The S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best shipping stocks, gained 25.7% as of the close of December 21."", 'Shipping stocks are favored by investors for several reasons, one being their consistent payment of dividends.

The World Economic Forum has highlighted that approximately 90% of the goods circulating across the globe are transported through maritime channels. This statistic unveils the pivotal role played by sea-based transportation in sustaining international trade and supply chains."", 'The COVID-19 pandemic brought attention to shipping stocks, usually not in the spotlight. Investors saw firsthand how vital marine shipping is for the global economy during this time. This significant surge during the pandemic was because people turned to online shopping platforms. This increased demand for high-value items like home appliances and electronics. As a result, logistics companies, responsible for transporting goods from manufacturers to stores and residences, saw a rise in their revenues due to this heightened demand. From around mid-March to October 2020, amid the peak of global pandemic restrictions, the largest shipping firms worldwide collectively increased their market value by more than $23 billion, as reported by Forbes.', ""That said, regular supply chains faced major disruptions during the pandemic, causing many of the world's large cargo ships and containers to be in the wrong places when a sudden surge in demand occurred. With people confined to their homes and unable to spend on experiences, they turned to purchasing goods instead. This unexpected shift overwhelmed the shipping industry, as it wasn't prepared for such a rapid increase in shipping needs. However, even amid these disruptions, shipping stocks continued to play a vital role in the global economy. In 2021, the total value of global trade reached an astonishing $28.5 trillion. A substantial portion of this immense cargo movement was facilitated by publicly traded shipping companies, underlining their significant contribution to global trade and commerce despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. In addition to this, between 2021 and 2022, the largest carriers made a combined net income of $364 billion, a stark change after a decade of minimal profits according to data from industry expert John McCown."", ""In a recent development, shipping stocks experienced a global increase in value. This rise was fueled by anticipated disruptions in Red Sea routes due to militant attacks, which were expected to lead to higher charges for transporting goods via ocean containers. These potential price hikes offered a glimmer of relief for investors who had witnessed a year of lackluster performance in the sector. Following the pandemic, freight rates declined as the initial surge in demand for tangible products subsided, and the logistical challenges related to Covid gradually improved. Compounding these challenges was the adverse impact of elevated global interest rates, further adding to the sector's woes. The S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best shipping stocks, gained 25.7% as of the close of December 21."", 'Shipping stocks are favored by investors for several reasons, one being their consistent payment of dividends.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out\xa05 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""Stagflation is characterized by a persistent combination of elevated inflation, simultaneous peak unemployment, and sluggish demand. Initially considered an unfamiliar concept, economists came to recognize the reality of stagflation following the 'Great Inflation' of the 1970s. This phenomenon revealed that, contrary to the conventional expectation of unemployment and inflation moving in opposite directions, stagflation can adversely impact an economy. Daniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, describes stagflation as:"", '""Stagflation is difficult to tackle from a policy perspective, as actions that counteract inflation (i.e., higher interest rates, decreasing the money supply) may exacerbate the level of unemployment and slow the economy further. The three components of stagflation (high inflation, high unemployment, weak demand) have an impact on the revenue, profitability and valuation of businesses, which in turn affects the price an investor is willing to pay for a share.""', 'Until recently, Wall Street experts considered stagflation as the predominant risk for the global economy in 2023. They were of the opinion that any upswing in equity markets appeared unsustainable in the aftermath of the significant selloff in 2022. Seven months following the initial estimate of Q1 2023 GDP growth, which was subsequently revised upward by 1.1%, concerns about stagflation in the United States were alleviated by the recent Q3 2023 GDP growth estimates. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, annualized real GDP growth surged to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023, signifying the swiftest rate of expansion since Q4 2021.', ""Stagflation tends to favor defensive companies, those providing essential products and services for people's daily needs. Consequently, the share prices of such companies often demonstrate resilience despite a slowing macroeconomic environment. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors typically exhibit a market beta of under 1, indicating outperformance when the benchmark index declines. On the other hand, cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, signaling underperformance when the index falls. Defensive sectors that perform well in stagflation economies include utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate. Conversely, cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials may face challenges during such economic conditions. With that said, it’s worth noting that certain stocks, including household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), are notably more secure against periods of stagflation that others."", 'Copyright: defotoberg / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology', ""In compiling the best stagflation stocks to buy, we have chosen stocks characterized by their defensive attributes, robust market visibility, resilient dividend profiles, and a longstanding history of navigating through volatile market environments.

Over the years, it has obtained approval or authorization for 12 medicines. Its strong in-house development has made it one of the larger healthcare stocks in the world, with a market capitalization in excess of $90 billion.', 'In five years, shares of Regeneron have risen close to 130%, soundly outperforming the S&P 500 index and its more modest 87% gains. The business has been a popular investment option for growth-oriented investors. But where will Regeneron be a year from now, and is it still a good investment to hold in your portfolio today?', 'One early development that investors should watch for in 2024 is the potential approval and launch of odronextamab. In September, Regeneron announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted a priority review for its Biologics License Application for odronextamab, which is a treatment for the two most common types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The PDUFA date is set for March 31, 2024.', ""Analysts at GlobalData project that at its peak, odronextamab could generate $468 million by 2029. While that wouldn't necessarily do much for Regeneron's top line next year, news of an approval could lead to more bullishness and momentum behind the stock."", 'In September, Regeneron completed its acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics, which has gene therapy programs aimed at treating hearing loss. Regeneron\'s Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., said that ""we are actively expanding our expertise in cutting-edge genetic medicine approaches, which currently includes gene silencing, gene editing and gene therapy technologies with the potential to address many serious and hard-to-treat diseases.""', ""Depending on whether milestones are reached, Regeneron could end up paying $213 million for Decibel's business. That's a fairly modest amount given that Regeneron has generated nearly $4.4 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. And as of the end of September, the company had close to $10 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books."", 'Regeneron does have the resources at its disposal to get bigger. And with many gene-editing companies still relatively small and in their early growth stages, it could be an area that Regeneron continues to target in the coming year; staking out a position in the industry now could help the company secure an advantage.', 'I would expect Regeneron to acquire another company to further bolster and diversify its business, but whether that happens within the next year is a big question.', ""In Regeneron's most recent quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, revenue totaled $3.4 billion, up 15% year over year. But those gains were largely due to collaboration revenue. The company's net product sales of just under $1.8 billion declined by 1%."", 'Next year, however, there could be better numbers as the company only launched its higher-dose version of Eylea, its treatment for eye disease, in August. Called Eylea HD, the recent approval has given the company a way to help fend off competition for its lower-dose version of Eylea -- its sales declined by 11% last quarter. Stronger growth, in turn, could lead to a better bottom line, as Regeneron typically reports a profit margin of at least 30%.', ""Regeneron's stock is currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just under 20, which is in line with the healthcare industry average. While it may not be a cheap buy, there's still good value here for long-term investors. With room for more growth, Regeneron could end up being an excellent investment to build your portfolio around since it still has the potential to be a market-beating stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The idea is that those who are willing to hold onto their investments for an extended period stand to benefit the most from this strategy. One of the key secrets to success in dividend investing lies in the power of compounding. Reinvesting dividends—putting those earnings straight back into buying more shares of the same investment—helps investors make their money work harder. Instead of pocketing the dividend payouts, they're plowed back into the investment, allowing for the accumulation of more shares. Reinvesting dividends has proven to be a powerful strategy that has significantly contributed to superior returns over the years. According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed directly to reinvested dividends and the magic of compounding."", ""Investors often focus on stock price appreciation as the primary measure of their investment's success. However, a closer examination of the performance of leading global indexes over a 25-year period ending in March 2018 revealed that reinvested dividends contributed significantly to an additional growth of nearly 3% in these indexes, according to Forbes. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that reinvested dividends add a substantial layer of growth to investment beyond what is solely achieved through the increase in stock prices. This growth serves as a compelling reminder to investors about the significance of a comprehensive approach to measuring investment performance. Focusing solely on stock price appreciation might provide a partial view of an investment's success, but factoring in the reinvestment of dividends into the equation reveals a more accurate and holistic picture of overall returns."", 'In our article titled 13 Best DRIP Stocks to Own, we delved into the crucial role of dividend stocks in achieving long-term investment success. Referencing a report by T. Rowe Price, the article highlighted that over the last three decades until last year, reinvested dividends significantly contributed to the overall gains of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for a substantial 42.5%. The report also revealed the increased impact of dividend reinvestment, particularly for a select group of outstanding companies that consistently raise their dividends at a pace faster than the overall market. This phenomenon gains strength because the more often a growing dividend is reinvested, the greater its potential to significantly bolster long-term investment returns.', 'Investing in stocks that offer strong dividend growth potential can be a smart strategy for long-term investors seeking consistent returns. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), \xa0The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and\xa0AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best DRIP stocks to own due to their robust track records of dividend growth and stability.

As we look forward to numerous holidays, special traditions, and spending time with loved ones, I can't help but think about the impact of my actions. Sometimes it feels like my actions alone can't really change the amount of consumption, waste, and emissions the holiday season produces. And it's true, alone I can't. That's where all of you come in! Based on research by The United Nations Environment Programme, household consumption accounts for around two-thirds of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."", 'As a member of the Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, I am deeply invested in our planet and hope to help educate others on various topics surrounding environmental sustainability. So I spoke with some of our Cisco Green Team members about ways to help reduce your holiday footprint, positively impact the planet, and help you feel good about the actions you take this season.', 'Decreasing Energy Usage', ""Switch to LED lights: Decorating with lights is popular this time of year. It's dazzling and it's festive so what's the problem? It's estimated that throughout the month of December, in the U.S. alone, households will use 3.5 billion kWh of electricity to power holiday lights, which is equivalent to the annual energy usage of 350,000 homes. However, if everyone were to switch to LED lights, the usage would decrease to one quarter of the amount, as LED use about 85% less energy than traditional lights. Plus, it would cut down on everyone's electricity bill (around $850 million each year!)"", 'Invest in a timer: Ever go to bed and forget to turn off your lights? An easy solution is to add a timer to your lights. This way you can set how long your lights will be using energy and when you would like them to turn on and off each day.', 'Reducing Waste', 'Cut down on food waste: Hosting dinner parties, baking cookies, and sharing meals are all delicious ways to enjoy the gift of food, but they can also lead to unexpected waste. Did you know that one-third of all food produced in the world - approximately 1.3 billion tonnes - is lost or wasted every year?', 'Grocery stores and households both play a part in managing the amount of surplus food, whether unsold or uneaten, that is discarded into landfills. According to ReFED, it makes up 24% of all landfill inputs, making food the number one material in landfills. The good news is we have a few ways to cut this number down.', 'Start with buying only what you need and plan ahead if you know you need to feed a certain number of people. If you do have scraps or leftovers, sending them to a landfill won\'t helpto reduce GHG emissions. The decomposition of food and other organic materials in an environment without oxygen (like a landfill), produces methane, a greenhouse gas. Wasted food is responsible for 58% of landfill methane emissions. Instead, take notes from Cisco\'s Tram Quach in Raleigh, United States: ""We compost our cooking scraps at home with a tumbler in our backyard and use glass containers to take or bring back food to avoid using disposables."" Composting is a great option to discard food waste and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, one of the easiest ways to cut down on food waste is simply eating all your leftovers. Bonus points if they are in reusable containers like Tram\'s.', ""Be conscious of packaging and decor: Opening a special gift from a loved one can create an unmatched feeling. Unfortunately, most conventional wrapping paper sold in stores has plastic lining, coating, or harmful chemicals, which means it cannot be recycled. Out of the 4.6 million pounds of wrapping paper produced each year, around half, or 2.3 million pounds ends up in landfills (that's 277,000 miles worth!)"", 'Don\'t worry, you can be sustainable and still experience the surprise of unwrapping a gift. ""I always find fun, silly, and odd things to wrap my gifts in from around my house. Whether it be newspaper, unused fabrics, or other creative materials, this has been a loved tradition in my family, and they always look forward to what I come up with,"" says Cisco\'s Angee Barnett from Topika, United States.', 'Similarly, Green Team co-lead Jordan Hart White based in Raleigh, United States likes to wrap presents in butcher paper and then draw on decorations and name tags. ""This saves some of the plastic holiday waste from going into the trash and allows me time to get creative,"" says Jordan, who knows her plastics!', 'Another part of holidays that bring both joy and waste are decorations. And I get it, who doesn\'t love festive décor? But as always, there are ways to make this tradition a little lighter on the planet. One example comes from Toronto, Canada Green Team member Alyssa Copp: ""Make your own decorations! I strung my first citrus garland this year which is both sustainable AND economical!"" This might even check off two boxes: consciously made décor and cutting down on food waste, a win-win. Besides making your own decorations, another option is to thrift or buy secondhand.', 'Avoiding Over Consumption', 'Forgo buying new: In the sustainability world, we say ""why buy new, when you can get it used or homemade?"" or maybe that\'s just me! People buy 60 percent more clothing today than 15 years ago, and each item is kept for only half as long. Getting used items or DIYing is a unique and circular way to change up your wardrobe. ""Instead of buying new ethnic wear for Diwali, I often try and wear my mom\'s age-old sarees (Indian ethnic wear),"" says Cisco\'s Neha Agarwal from Bangalore, India, ""which have not been worn by her for one or two decades at least. They feel new because no one remembers seeing them. I am totally re-using them and make small fashion edits to make it match the current fashion trend."" We love mom\'s hand-me-downs!', 'Like decorations, gifts are a perfect opportunity to get creative and make something homemade. If you aren\'t the DIY type, secondhand stores have gift options for everyone. Cisco\'s Erin Carter from Chapel Hill, United States likes to incorporate both by buying cute baskets at thrift shops, lining them with paper, and filling them with cookies as gifts. And Green Team member Elizaveta Vatlina from Oeiras, Portugal also opts for secondhand, saying ""Last year I didn\'t buy clothes at a new store, instead I used Vinted or vintage stores.""', ""There are several online secondhand stores that are wonderful options if you don't have the means to get out to your local secondhand store. A few that I know of are Vinted, Mercari, Depop, Poshmark, and thredUp, but I am sure there are many more. San Jose, United States Green Team member Kayshav Dattatri recommended Thriftbooks.com as a great online source for used books at a bargain!"", ""A final idea from Cisco's Scott Weber based out of Ann Arbor, United States is a book exchange where each person brings a book that they enjoyed reading over the past year. Then everyone goes home with a new-to-them used book and a personal recommendation."", 'Buy local: If you are interested in buying something new, there are plenty of amazing options that you can find right down the road. Yes, I\'m talking about shopping right in your local community! ""I\'m a big book-giver, so I head down to my local used bookshop and pick out gifts there,"" says Cisco\'s Ron Toland in Vancouver, Canada. It\'s estimated that buying locally generates 3.5 times more wealth than shopping at national chains. Plus, it reduces your carbon footprint by cutting down on the amount of fossil fuels that are burned, since it changes how far goods must travel.', 'Give experiences: This idea stems from the absence of buying something material. ""I love to gift experiences instead of things!"" says Cisco\'s Alex Wilkins, from San Jose, United States, ""I\'m planning a cooking class for my partner, a fancy dinner with my mother, and bowling with my brother!"" Other ideas could include guitar lessons, yoga classes, or tickets to a concert, comedy show, sporting event, or museum exhibit.', ""Donate or volunteer: Donating to charity on behalf of another instead of giving physical gifts is an idea brought to us by Sydney, Australia Green Team member Vivien Chia. You can also get in touch with local charities to see if they have volunteering opportunities available, because giving your time is an incredible gift. And don't forget, Cisco provides 10 days a year of Time2Give, donates $10 for every hour volunteered, and matches dollar for dollar on approved organization donations."", 'There are probably hundreds of other ways that we can practice sustainability during the holiday season. If you have a favorite practice, share it in the comments! Our decisions matter and we can create change with the choices we make. I hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday season!', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
