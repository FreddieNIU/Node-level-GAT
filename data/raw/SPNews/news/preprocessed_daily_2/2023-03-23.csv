Shaw Group.Fleetcor, which provides fuel cards and workforce payments products, added Rahul Gupta, a veteran board member director and expert in the digital services and payments industry, as a new director.The company and D.E. Shaw will jointly select a second director who will join the board later. The board added technology executive Annabelle Bexiga in January and said it expects one of its ""longer tenured directors will retire,"" later.Fleetcor, which is valued at $14 billion and is headquartered in Atlanta, has seen its stock price drop 22% over the last 52 weeks as investors have become frustrated with how its businesses are linked together.Investors have expressed concern about the fuel card business as the industry shifts more to electric vehicles.On Monday, investors sent the company's stock up more 7% at $201.57 in morning trading.As part of the agreement, the board will review the company's portfolio and create a new committee to review strategic alternatives including the separation or sale of one or more of its businesses.The review will complement an ongoing ""business simplification plan"" and should be finished by the end of 2023, the company said.Ronald Clarke, who has served as Fleetcor's chief executive since 2000, could see his compensation increase significantly if the stock price climbs high enough.According to a regulatory filing, Clarke could earn more than $100 million if the stock price hits $400 a share by the end of 2024. If the stock price does not hit at least $350 a share, Clarke would get nothing.The announcements come after weeks of discussions with D.E. Shaw, which owns an unspecified stake in the company.Story continuesD.E. Shaw, oversees more than $60 billion in assets and occasionally pushes for changes at companies. In December, it reached an agreement with Fidelity National Information Services . Two months later the company announced plans to spin off its Merchant Solutions business, which will be named Worldpay.When D.E. Shaw encourages corporate boards to rethink strategy, the hedge fund prefers to conduct talks out of the limelight and often surfaces publicly only after an agreement has been signed.Last year, D.E. Shaw settled with parcel delivery firm FedEx to add two directors and will have a say in appointing a third one. It pushed Verisk Analytics to become a pure play insurance data business and in October Verisk announced a deal to sell its energy-consulting arm, Wood Mackenzie.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Editing by Louise Heavens and Bill Berkrot)]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Charles Schwab with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab How Quickly Is Charles Schwab Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Charles Schwab has grown EPS by 10% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that Charles Schwab's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. Charles Schwab maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 12% to US$21b.

The result is massive scale, a trusted brand, and an ever- expanding portfolio of products and services.At month-end September 2022, Schwab's total client assets stood at $6.6 trillion, making it one of the largest wealth management platforms in the US. This scale allows the company to serve its customers well and at a virtually unrivaled cost, creating something of a virtuous circle.

With innovative developments from Kilby Labs, TI's research and development labs for new concepts and breakthrough ideas, the new portfolio of stand-alone active EMI filter ICs can sense and cancel common-mode EMI by as much as 30 dB at frequencies between 100 kHz and 3 MHz in single- and three-phase AC power systems. This capability enables designers to reduce the size of chokes by 50%, compared to purely passive filter solutions, and meet stringent EMI requirements. For more information on TI's new power-supply filter ICs portfolio, see TI.com/AEF.""To meet customer needs for higher performance and lower-cost systems, TI continues to advance in power innovations to cost-effectively address EMI design challenges,"" said Carsten Oppitz, general manager for switching regulators at TI. ""We believe that this new portfolio of stand-alone active EMI filter ICs will further help engineers solve their design challenges and maximize performance and power density in automotive, enterprise, aerospace and industrial applications.""Significantly reduce system size, weight and cost and improve reliabilityOne of the main challenges when designing high-density switching regulators is how to implement a compact and efficient design of the EMI input filter. Through capacitive amplification, these new active EMI filter ICs enable engineers to shrink the inductance value of common-mode chokes by as much as 80%, helping to cost-effectively achieve improved mechanical reliability and increased power density.Story continuesThe new family of active EMI filter ICs consists of the TPSF12C1 and TPSF12C3 for single- and three-phase commercial applications and TPSF12C1-Q1 and TPSF12C3-Q1 for automotive applications. These devices can efficiently reduce the heat generated in a power-supply EMI filter, which also extends filter capacitor lifetimes and increases system reliability.The new active EMI filter ICs incorporate sensing, filtering, gain and injection stages. Offered in a SOT-23 14-pin package, the IC integrates compensation and protection circuitry to further reduce the implementation complexity and minimize the number of external components.Mitigate common-mode emissions to meet stringent EMI standardsComité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques (CISPR) standards are the global benchmark for limiting EMI in electrical and electronic devices. The TPSF12C1, TPSF12C3, TPSF12C1-Q1, and TPSF12C3-Q1 help detect, process and reduce EMI in a broad range of AC/DC power supplies, on-board chargers, servers, UPS and other similar systems where common-mode noise dominates. Therefore, engineers will be able to address EMI design challenges and meet CISPR 11, CISPR 32 and CISPR 25 EMI requirements.TI's active EMI filter ICs meet IEC 61000-4-5 surge immunity requirements, thus minimizing the need for external protection components, such as transient voltage suppression (TVS) diodes. With supporting tools, such as PSpice® for TI simulation models and quick-start calculators, designers can easily select and implement the optimal components for their system.

Archer Daniels has continued to benefit from higher commodity prices as a producer and processor of food and beverage ingredients, including oilseeds, corn, wheat, and cocoa.To that point, earnings estimates revisions have continued to go up over the last 30 days. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now risen 7% throughout the quarter and FY24 estimates have climbed 17%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is a great sign as Archer Daniels is following a very tough to compete against fiscal 2022 that saw EPS at $7.85 per share. Still, the rising earnings estimates are a great sign Archer Daniels will have another strong year with CEO Juan Luciano stating the company is positioned well for 2023 and beyond.Dividend History: ADM has a 2.34% annual dividend yield at $1.80 a share. The annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 4.03%. Archer Daniels currently has a 20% payout ratio and has now raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years recently becoming a Dividend King.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of ADM are down -17% year to date, but this year’s drop may be a buying opportunity as Archer Daniels stock is still up +37% over the last two years to easily top the S&amp;P 500's -1% and the Agricultural Operations Markets +7%.  Making Archer Daniels stock look more attractive at the moment is its valuation. Shares of ADM trade at 11.4X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the industry average of 17.6X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.1X. This is also 44% below its decade high of 20.5X and a 22% discount to the median of 14.6X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor (NUE)The next highly ranked Dividend King was recently added back to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list today with steel producer Nucor continuing to benefit from higher commodity prices.2022 was Nucor’s most profitable year ever at $7.61 billion in net earnings and EPS of $28.79. As the largest recycler in North America, Nucor has been able to boost profits through scrap metal used in steel and iron production.While 2022 will be an extremely tough year to follow, earnings estimates have continued to soar throughout the quarter. Fiscal 2023 EPS estimates have soared 24% with FY24 estimates up 11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividend History: NUE has a 1.38% annual dividend yield at $2.04 a share. Nucor’s’ dividend growth over the last five years is 6.19% with a payout ratio of 7%.

Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001353.html,1679403601,STORY,"['PAAS', 'NUE']","[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nucor (NUE) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.26 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 20, 2023.Nucor's Earnings ESP sits at 3.07%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.13.NUE is part of a big group of Basic Materials stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Pan American Silver (PAAS) as well.Pan American Silver is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 10, 2023. PAAS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.09 a share 50 days from its next earnings release.Pan American Silver's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 36.11% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NUE and PAAS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The steel giant is expected to benefit from improved market conditions and cost-improvement actions. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.ArcelorMittal has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make ArcelorMittal an attractive choice for investors right now.Estimates NorthboundOver the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ArcelorMittal for 2023 has increased around 11.7%. The consensus estimate for 2024 has also been revised 4.2% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryArcelorMittal’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 94.4%.Valuation Looks AttractiveArcelorMittal’s shares are currently trading at a level that is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the stock still has upside potential.Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, ArcelorMittal is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 1.65, cheaper compared with the industry average of 4.83.Growth Drivers in PlaceArcelorMittal is expected to benefit from improved demand conditions in 2023 following aggressive destocking. The company sees world apparent steel consumption, excluding China, to recover by 2-3% year over year in 2023. ArcelorMittal also expects its steel shipments to grow by roughly 5% year over year in 2023.While real consumption growth is anticipated to remain lackluster in the United States, MT expects the end of destocking to lead to a rise in apparent consumption by 1.5-3.5% in 2023. The company also envisions apparent demand in Europe to recover by 0.5-2.5% in 2023.ArcelorMittal also expects a strong recovery in economic growth in China in 2023 as COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted. However, factoring in the sustained softness in real estate during the year, it projects steel consumption to stabilize in 2023 (+1% to -1%) with potential upside dependent on China government’s infrastructure stimulus.Moreover, the company is expanding its steel-making capacity and remains focused on shifting to high-added-value products. As part of this move, ArcelorMittal is expanding its automotive steel line of products. The company is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high-strength steelsThe company’s cost-improvement initiatives will also support profitability. MT, in 2022, set out a new value plan worth $1.5 billion to maintain cost position, to be achieved over three years. The plan is focused on creating value through commercial and operational improvements. These include volume, mix and variable cost improvement. The company realized improvements of $0.4 billion from actions taken in 2022.Story continuesArcelorMittal Price and Consensus ArcelorMittal Price and ConsensusArcelorMittal price-consensus-chart | ArcelorMittal Quote Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Steel Dynamics, Inc.

The facility has an annual capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia.Per the agreement, CF Industries will pay $1.675 billion for the Waggaman ammonia plant and related assets. The company will allocate roughly $425 million of the purchase price to a long-term ammonia offtake agreement wherein it will supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL's Dyno Nobel subsidiary. CF Industries aims to fund the remaining $1.25 billion of the purchase price with cash on hand.The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors and is subject to necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.This deal with IPL leverages industry-leading ammonia production capabilities and generates long-term value for shareholders of both companies. The Waggaman facility is expected to fit seamlessly into the company's network and strategic focus on ammonia as a clean energy source.

Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in 2023. Higher prices are also likely to drive sales across the company’s phosphate and potash units.The company, on its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects strong agricultural commodity pricing trends to drive the recovery of demand in the fertilizers market in 2023. Mosaic also noted that the demand for grains and oilseeds is high. Higher biofuel consumption, crop production and concerns over food security are expected to continue to drive elevated crop prices through this year and potentially beyond, resulting in higher global fertilizer demand during the year.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability. Transformational savings are also expected to drive margins in its Mosaic Fertilizantes segment.However, the company is likely to continue to face headwinds due to high prices of key raw material. Prices of sulfur and ammonia remain elevated, made worse by the uncertainties over the supply from Russia amid the war.  Plant shutdowns and maintenance have also led to a tight supply of raw materials. As such, the company is expected to face margin pressure associated higher input costs. Some impacts of input cost inflation are expected to continue in the first quarter of 2023. Higher costs are likely to continue to impact margins in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment in the first quarter.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Steel Dynamics, Inc.

(NYSE:AYI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Acuity Brands Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$462.1mUS$482.6mUS$516.1mUS$541.6mUS$563.7mUS$583.3mUS$601.1mUS$617.7mUS$633.4mUS$648.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.2% US$423US$405US$397US$381US$364US$345US$325US$306US$288US$270(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.5bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$649m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.2%– 2.1%) = US$9.3bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.3b÷ ( 1 + 9.2%)10= US$3.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.4b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$182, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acuity Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.195. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Acuity BrandsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electrical industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electrical market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

After declining 21.9% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why ARE Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of ARE shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 18.86. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for AREThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ARE in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ARE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

25,ee448edb-11d1-33c3-a2f4-edf6f756d131,ARE,2023-03-23,Should You Retain Cousins Properties (CUZ) Stock for Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retain-cousins-properties-cuz-stock-142202936.html,1679322122,STORY,"['CUZ', 'TRNO', 'ARE']","[Cousins Properties CUZ is well-poised to benefit from its unmatched portfolio of class A office assets concentrated in the high-growth markets in the Sun Belt region amid the recovering U.S. office real estate market.However, a competitive landscape and high supply in the office real estate market are expected to adversely impact Cousins Properties’ pricing power. Also, interest rate hikes add to its concerns.With the gradual return of the workforce to offices, Cousins Properties has been witnessing a recovery in demand for its highly amenitized, well-placed office properties, as highlighted by a rebound in the new leasing volume.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cousins Properties executed 39 leases for a total of 632,379 square feet of office space, with a weighted average term of 11.6 years. This marked the highest quarterly square footage volume of 2022.Going forward, the next cycle of office space demand is likely to be driven by the inbound migration and significant investments announced by office occupiers to expand the footprint in the Sun Belt regions. This is expected to boost the demand for CUZ’s high-quality portfolio of office assets in the forthcoming quarters.Moreover, the company’s well-diversified, high-end tenant roster assures stable rental revenues for the company and lowers the risk associated with dependency on single-industry tenants. With ample financial flexibility, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities.However, the elevated supply of office properties weighs on Cousins Properties. Intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate limits its ability to retain tenants at relatively higher rents and dents its pricing power.Given the competitive landscape, it might become increasingly challenging for the company to backfill near-term tenant move-outs, resulting in lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Also, with the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, the demand for premium office spaces is likely to remain choppy in the near term, hurting the leasing volume.Further, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for Cousins Properties. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. We anticipate interest expenses for 2023 to be $90.3 million, suggesting an increase of 24.5% year over year. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 22.6% over the past three months, wider than the industry’s fall of 2.6%. Also, consensus estimates for first and second-quarter 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share have remained unchanged over the past month.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

After declining 25.2% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for AREThe RSI reading of 13.29 for ARE is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ARE has increased 0%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ARE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

27,6fd429c2-56b7-3402-bdf0-b302f374889a,ARE,2023-03-23,3 Top Dividend Stocks to Maximize Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-maximize-131001223.html,1679317801,STORY,['ARE'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.1 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.49%. This compares to the Financial - Mortgage &amp; Related Services industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 7.95%. Check Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.86% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5.22% over the past year. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.57 per share, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has a dividend yield of 3.43%. This is compared to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 10.2%. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA.Industry: Textile - ApparelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2068420/5-textile---apparel-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-headwindsPersistent inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to remain a concern for several players in the Zacks Textile – Apparel industry. Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are hurting many companies in the space.Nevertheless, efforts to enhance store and digital operations along with robust brand enhancement endeavors keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Crocs, Inc., PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear.The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also offer fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks.The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs.Story continuesAdditionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies' margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies' performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers' growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry.Companies in the space have long been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players' growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic boosted the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #180, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates robust near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, analysts are gradually becoming less confident about this group's earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of Jan 2023, the industry's consensus earnings estimate for the current financial year has fallen 7.3%.Let's look at the industry's performance and current valuation.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector while it underperformed the S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.The industry declined 21.7% during this period compared with the broader sector's plunge of 22.6%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 13.2% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), commonly used for valuing consumer discretionary stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.03X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 17.60X and the sector's 17.77X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.28X, as low as 9.90X and at the median of 18.15X.5 Textile - Apparel Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnRalph Lauren: The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products.

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc.

These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also offer fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. Companies in the space have long been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In.We have seen a lot of investor repositioning in recent days as the global banking crisis has created market panic. The markets are unclear of whether the Fed will do a quarter point rate hike or if it will pause. However, as banking failures unfold, the markets are beginning to adopt the view that a Fed pause or a Fed halt should be the right course of action. According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, so far, there is a 28.4% chance of the Fed not raising interest rates and a 71.6% chance that the Fed decides to go with a quarter point hike.Strategist Says ""I Think The Smartest Move Is To Stop""On March 20 Colliers Securities' chief global strategist, Mark Grant, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the current market situation and the Fed. Mark Grant noted that the current market environment is extremely volatile and he thinks it can get worse. Mark Grant thinks that the American and European banking crisis are expected to spell further trouble for both nations' financial systems. He said that markets ""don't understand the potential liabilities of American banks, bondholders, and European banks, it's a mess"". Mark Grant thinks that the banking failures are a consequence of both Fed policy and also poor management at regional banks like SVB. Here are some comments from Mark Grant:""The part of the problem, in my opinion, the Fed stayed at interest rates that were way too low for too long, ever since the financial crisis of 2008-9. And then they made a second mistake which was raising interest rates much too quickly and too aggressively, and that is feeding into the financial stability of many of the regional banks in the country.""Mark Grant thinks that the Fed should stop raising interest rates as this would be the ""the smartest move"". He thinks the Fed should realign its focus to dealing with systemic risk and allow the markets to settle down. Once that is achieved, he thinks the Fed can continue to bring inflation down to 2%.Story continuesThe stock market is extremely volatile right now and investors should position carefully.

(NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty.

As of December 31, Third Point is the largest investor in the company and has a stake worth $716.6 million.Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”14. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:TMO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leader in attractive end markets with a skilled management team who has demonstrated the ability to consistently and wisely allocate capital. It is the world leader in serving science. It is a globally scaled supplier serving more than 400,000 customers working within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, research institutions, and government agencies. Thermo provides many of the products and services that companies in these industries, particularly pharma and biotech, need to operate and drive science forward. The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services. Thermo received a COVID boost as they supply COVID PCR tests as well as some products used in the production of COVID vaccines. As such, it is in the process of growing over that excess demand. We expect the company to move past this growth headwind by the back half of 2023. At approximately 24x our estimate for nexttwelve-months earnings per share, we believe Thermo’s valuation is attractive for this type of consistent, well-managed, and durable business.”13.

Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry.

ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years.

We decided to move on from the name as its traditional linear programming business is dissolving more quickly than expected, while its Disney+ streaming business cannot offset the affiliate fees and advertising revenue that the company has relied on for years. Disney’s parks business has done well recently due to strong pricing power but we have concerns that consumers will continue to spend on such discretionary purchases in a recessionary environment.

In July, we initiated our position in Uber, a leader in global ride-hailing and online food delivery. We believe the company is wellpositioned to benefit from strong secular tailwinds in both of its core businesses. Earlier this year, management outlined a plan at its investor day to achieve $4 billion of free cash flow by 2024, an encouraging commitment given investors have maligned the company for years of being unprofitable. We witnessed solid progress toward achieving this goal in the company’s most recent earnings results, where it beat expectations for the quarter on both fronts and delivered positive FCF for the first time. The company also indicated it isn’t seeing any evidence of slowing demand. We recognize the execution risk associated with Uber achieving its long-term targets, and the path likely won’t be linear, which is why we are keeping our position size modest until we see signs of continued operational momentum in the coming quarters.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:Aggressive Stock Portfolio: 12 Hedge Fund Stock Picks10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Chris Hohn11 Most Undervalued EV Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 16 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 33%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 10%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 17% over three years. Even worse, it's down 23% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$3.2b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the one-year loss for shareholders. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unhappily, U.S. Bancorp had to report a 28% decline in EPS over the last year. This proportional reduction in earnings per share isn't far from the 33% decrease in the share price. Given the lower EPS we might have expected investors to lose confidence in the stock, but that doesn't seemed to have happened. Instead, the change in the share price seems to reduction in earnings per share, alone.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 1 year was -30%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 10% in the twelve months, U.S. Bancorp shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 2% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

44,a8ad00d7-8aa0-39d9-8d25-008c6ad2deca,CF,2023-03-23,Asure Software and CF Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asure-software-cf-industries-highlighted-112811590.html,1679570891,STORY,"['CF', 'ASUR', 'TOL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 23, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Asure Software ASUR as the Bull of the Day and CF Industries CF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, Tecnoglass Inc. TGLS and NVR, Inc. NVR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Asure Software, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been widely outperforming since bottoming out last October. A new bullish phase has begun for the stock as it has been hitting a series of 52-week highs this year on increasing volume. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.ASUR is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores with a best-in-class 'A' rating in each of our Zacks Growth and Momentum categories, indicating further upside is likely. The company is part of the Zacks Internet – Delivery Services industry group, which currently ranks in the top 4% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because this group is in the top half of all industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionAsure Software provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software and services. The company helps small and medium-sized businesses to build productive teams and allocate resources efficiently. ASUR offers payroll, tax, and human resources software to the payroll service industry along with mid-market and large corporate employers. Story continuesAsure Marketplace helps automate interactions between the company's HCM systems and third-party providers. ASUR was incorporated in 1985 and based in Austin, TX.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates ASUR has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 445.8%. The software firm most recently reported fourth-quarter earnings back in February of $0.17/share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.01 by 1,600%.Asure software has witnessed improving earnings estimate revisions. Looking into the current year, analysts have raised their 2023 EPS estimates by 25% in the past 60 days. The '23 Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $0.35/share.Let's Get TechnicalASUR shares have advanced more than 170% off the bottom from last year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make this type of price move while the general market remains volatile. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, ASUR is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Asure Software has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and ASUR continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year. Bottom LineASUR has vastly outperformed its software peers, and increasing volume throughout the year adds to the bullish sentiment.Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and healthy history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Investors would be wise to consider ASUR as a portfolio candidate if they haven't already done so.Bear of the Day:CF Industries assists in the transformation of natural gas into nitrogen products. The company manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for fertilizer, energy, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities. CF Industries is a manufacturer and distributor of nitrogen fertilizer around the world. Its principal products include anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, and ammonium nitrate. CF Industries was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Deerfield, IL.The Zacks RundownCF Industries, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 14% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months – just as it has year-to-date.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Along with many other fertilizer stocks, CF experienced a climax top in August of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market remains volatile.Recent Earnings Misses &amp; Deteriorating Outlook CF has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the past seven quarters. Back in November of last year, the company reported Q3 earnings of $2.55/share, missing the $3.19/share Zacks Consensus estimate by -20.06%.CF Industries has posted an average earnings miss of -3.15% over the last four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and CF is no exception.The fertilizer company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have decreased estimates by -27.53% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $9.95/share, reflecting negative growth of -42.75% relative to fiscal 2022.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookWhile not the most accurate indicator, CF has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross', wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CF would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly -28% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make new highs anytime soon. The fact that CF is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of CF until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:3 Top Housing Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying SoonThe home builder sector, which predominantly consists of homebuilders, building product manufacturers, and home improvement companies, has gained decently this year. The home construction ETF has jumped around 12% over the past three months compared to the broader S&amp;P 500's gain of a meager 2.7%.This is in sharp contrast to last year, when the housing market had to bear the adverse impact of surging raw material prices and an increase in mortgage rates. However, the first year-over-year decrease in home prices in 11 years in February, coupled with lower mortgage prices, especially between mid-November through the beginning of last month, immensely boosted the struggling housing market. Existing home sales in the United States rebounded more than expected in the month.Existing home sales soared by 14.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.58 million, per the National Association of Realtors. This was the biggest jump since July 2020, and well above estimates of 4.2 million. Existing home sales were broad-based, with the South, West, and Midwest regions registering double-digit growth.It seems the worst may be over for the housing market, as the cooling of housing prices should certainly attract more buyers. In January, the median sales price of new houses declined nearly 1% year over year to $427,500. At the same time, inflation has been easing for some time now, which should undoubtedly compel the Federal Reserve to reduce the pace of its interest rate hikes. The central bank curtailed the increase in interest rate hikes, which currently stands at 0.25% versus 0.75% last year.Thus, the average 30-year mortgage rate has decreased considerably in recent times, thereby making financing new houses a bit cheaper. To top it, presently, there is undersupply of homes, indicating that any company which is part of the home builder sector could easily make the most of the demand-supply disparity when the economy gathers steam.Given such positives, it is prudent to invest in fundamentally sound housing stocks like Toll Brothers, Inc., Tecnoglass Inc. and NVR, Inc. that are well poised to scale upward as the home builder sector bounces back.These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Toll Brothers build single-family detached and attached home communities; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves. The company, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 10% over the past 60 days. TOL's expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 11%.Tecnoglass is engaged in manufacturing and selling architectural glass and windows and aluminum products for the residential complexes and commercial construction industries. The company, presently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 10.7% over the past 60 days. TGLS' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 15.4%.NVR is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings. The company, currently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 22.7% over the past 60 days. NVR's expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 4.3%.Shares of Toll Brothers, Tecnoglass and NVR, by the way, have already gained 16.7%, 24.8%, and 18.9%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339https://www.zacks.comZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

46,221cc5cd-49ed-3c8a-91b9-cfbc553fffb0,CF,2023-03-23,CF Industries (CF) to Buy Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-cf-buy-waggaman-105210800.html,1679395930,STORY,"['CF', 'NUE']","[CF Industries Holdings Inc. CF has announced a definitive purchase agreement with Incitec Pivot Limited (""IPL”) for the latter’s ammonia production facility in Waggaman, LA. The facility has an annual capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia.Per the agreement, CF Industries will pay $1.675 billion for the Waggaman ammonia plant and related assets. The company will allocate roughly $425 million of the purchase price to a long-term ammonia offtake agreement wherein it will supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL's Dyno Nobel subsidiary. CF Industries aims to fund the remaining $1.25 billion of the purchase price with cash on hand.The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors and is subject to necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.This deal with IPL leverages industry-leading ammonia production capabilities and generates long-term value for shareholders of both companies. The Waggaman facility is expected to fit seamlessly into the company's network and strategic focus on ammonia as a clean energy source. Prior to synergies, which the company intends to achieve through increased capacity utilization and operational and logistics optimization, CF Industries predicts that the plant will provide a gross margin per ton equivalent to its existing ammonia segment.Shares of CF Industries have decreased 27.4% in the past year compared with a 31% decline of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCF Industries, on its fourth quarter call, said that it expects global nitrogen prices to gain support from abundant agricultural demand. The company also expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to remain tight into 2025, supported by agricultural-led demand and persistently high energy prices in Europe and Asia. Demand for nitrogen continues to be driven by the need to replenish global grains stocks, per the company. CF believes it will take at least two years for harvests to fully replenish global grain stocks, which will support strong grain plantings aiding nitrogen applications further.Story continuesCF Industries Holdings, Inc.

(CF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-cf-130001034.html,1679317201,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -13.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which CF falls in, has lost 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $2.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42.8%. This estimate has changed -20.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of -27% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $1.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -33.4%. The $7.81 billion and $6.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -30.2% and -17.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.7%. EPS of $4.35 for the same period compares with $3.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.33%. The EPS surprise was +5.33%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CF Industries expects to fund the remaining $1.25 billion of the purchase price with cash on hand.""We are pleased to reach this agreement with Incitec Pivot Limited that benefits from our industry-leading ammonia production capabilities, deploys our capital efficiently and provides long-term value for both companies’ shareholders,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""We believe the Waggaman facility will fit seamlessly into our network, as well as our strategic focus on ammonia as a clean energy source, given its proximity and pipeline connection to our Donaldsonville, Louisiana, Complex, its distribution and logistics flexibility, and its favorable characteristics for the addition of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies to enable low-carbon ammonia production.""Ammonia produced at the Waggaman facility today is distributed ratably to three customers, including Dyno Nobel, with approximately 75% used in industrial applications. Based on the nature of the medium- to long-term offtake agreements in place with these customers, CF Industries estimates that the plant will generate gross margin per ton commensurate with its existing ammonia segment prior to synergies, which the Company expects to capture through greater capacity utilization and operational and logistics optimization. Over the last five years, CF Industries’ operational capabilities have resulted in ammonia asset utilization that is approximately 10% higher than the average utilization rate of the Company’s North American peers.Story continuesAdditionally, CF Industries anticipates implementing CCS at the site on an accelerated timeline, increasing its network’s low-carbon ammonia production capability, supporting Louisiana’s and the country’s climate goals, and earning 45Q tax credits for sequestered carbon dioxide.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.

51,107edc26-442c-3fd8-984b-5a7aa2737732,CTAS,2023-03-23,Water Stewardship at Cintas,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/water-stewardship-cintas-143000407.html,1679495400,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Originally published in Cintas 2022 ESG ReportNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2023 / Water is a central resource to our business at Cintas and it is a necessary input in one of our key business services. As we celebrate World Water Day, we believe Cintas has a profound responsibility to be mindful, considerate, and deliberate in our interactions with this vital natural resource.As a company, we recognize that water is already a scarce resource, so we strive to be a responsible community leader and respect our communities' right to water.To strengthen our resolve as a water consumer, we continue to explore opportunities that help lessen our water consumption. And as a responsible water steward, we continuously monitor our operations and processes, so we discharge water back to our local communities in a sustainable, responsible manner.WATER MANAGEMENT POSITION Our Water Position outlines how we work to evolve our business practices that involve water, and informs our efforts to conserve water and minimize our water draw.These opportunities include:Identifying further process efficiencies and water utilization methodsTreating wastewater in compliance with prevailing regulationsUtilizing appropriate reuse technologies when ableEngaging in cooperative relationships with our vendors, suppliers, and customers to identify opportunities and incorporate innovations to help manage water more responsibly throughout our value chainThese ambitions - added to our existing laundering processes, which require less water (and energy) than both traditional at-home laundering and our industry peers - help us maintain an acute perspective on our water stewardship activities.Further, our Water Position motivates us to identify and innovate even greater efficiencies that help maximize our achievements across our company's scale, even as our business continues to grow.CINTAS' WATER JOURNEY We take pride in our water-conservation efforts to date. In addition to our ongoing efforts to minimize water requirements and maximize water conservation throughout our company, we are placing focused attention on increasing our water-reuse efforts. For instance, we are seeking to build on the success that our production facilities around the Great Lakes have had in expanding their water reuse.Story continuesAs we aim to prioritize higher water reuse in areas of significant need, specific challenges presented by our locations in water-stressed regions provide us with opportunities to test and pilot programs. These areas include Arizona, California, Colorado, and Nevada.The majority of our FY'22 water withdrawal originates from 14 major water basins.APPROACH AND STRATEGY Cintas' efforts to increase water conservation go back decades. Decreasing our dependence on freshwater has been an ongoing focus of our engineering efforts.These efforts have also produced sound business practices by reducing our production costs and costs passed on to customers through our pricing models. The less water we use, the lower our costs - especially in areas where water prices are at a premium because of local restrictions or regulations, decreasing water availability, and/or localized conservation programming.Our water stewardship strategy has three main components:Conservation and minimization of the water we withdrawIdentification and implementation of process technologies and efficiencies that help further reduce our water useImplementation of water-reuse technologiesThroughout our water journey, we've fostered a culture of innovation among our employee-partners and vendors and have challenged them to modernize the commercial laundry industry.At Cintas, we've led the way by:Testing, refining, and installing capital equipment systems that help us conserve waterUtilizing evolving wash chemistry technologies and optimizing wash chemistry formulasAdopting common-sense behaviors that, taken together, have helped significantly reduce our costs and water consumptionExploring and installing broader water-reuse technologiesWater Conservation We're proud of our legacy of water-conservation efforts, and we know our ongoing commitment has produced a positive ripple effect throughout our industry. Throughout the last few decades, we've focused conservation efforts on minimizing our draw from freshwater sources and reducing our overall water needs.We've made significant strides in lowering the amount of water required to wash a pound of laundry without compromising our ability to meet hygienically clean certification standards (where applicable), which is critical to our customers.We continue to seek opportunities that will help us further reduce our water consumption. Our current initiatives highlight two key areas of ongoing opportunity: process efficiency improvements and wash chemistry. We work collaboratively with our capital equipment manufacturers and our wash chemistry partners to improve our operational footprint, and to realize the combined impacts of engineering efficiencies and chemical improvements on our water requirements.Water Reuse We are continuing to identify ways to increase water-reuse rates throughout our production facilities. We have seen impressive reuse capabilities at a number of our facilities with full reuse technology and complete monitoring systems.Taking the cues and learnings from these locations, we anticipate identifying the start of a more expansive enterprise-wide reuse strategy in future years. Our ability to expand and monitor our water-reuse capabilities at all our locations is an important step in our ongoing work to lessen our freshwater withdrawal and lower our overall water consumption.WATER RISK ASSESSMENT AND WATER-STRESSED REGIONSWith our operational footprint stretching from coast to coast across the United States and Canada, we draw water from a variety of sources, including water-stressed regions. The majority our FY'22 water withdrawal originated in 14 major water basins, with 82% of our water drawn from five sources: the Mississippi-Missouri river system (35%), the Gulf of Mexico (14%), the St. Lawrence River (17%), the North Atlantic Coast (9%), and the state of California (7%).An FY'22 water risk assessment identified 40 Rental plants that operate in water-stressed regions of the United States and Canada, where they are experiencing high to extremely high water stress. Of our 40 processing plants located in current water-stressed regions, 17 are in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Nevada, states which have been severely impacted by historic droughts and declining water tables. At operations in these states and other water-stressed regions, we are emphasizing water-reuse technologies. As good environmental stewards, increasing our reuse efforts will also be important to help supplement our ongoing water-conservation efforts.In the western region, legacy systems currently installed at our Las Vegas and Denver-area locations have provided contextual examples of how expanded reuse capabilities can positively affect water consumption.As various reuse opportunities and technologies emerge and evolve, we expect to prioritize the expansion of water-reuse capabilities in water-stressed regions and identify and apply appropriate technologies in these vital areas.MANAGING WASTEWATER AND EFFLUENTS Both our Environmental Compliance policy and our Water Management Position outline our expectation that our field locations treat and process wastewater as necessary to comply with their specific local, state, and federal regulatory requirements.Our wastewater treatment strategy has three main components:Approved chemical suppliers and wastewater-treatment equipmentProper maintenance of all wastewater-treatment equipmentWastewater testing and reportingWe have also implemented consistent treatment systems at our facilities to help our locations return wastewater to the local municipality according to all local regulations.THE WASTEWATERTREATMENT PROCESS Our wastewater-treatment process is consistent throughout all processing plants in our company. It begins with the removal of lint and other solids from wastewater after a wash cycle, which generates non-toxic waste that is disposed of in landfills.At facilities that require wastewater to be treated before it is discharged, the effluent-free wastewater is routed through an equalization tank for homogenization. It then flows through a dissolved air flotation (DAF) system for additional filtration and treatment.Once wastewater has cycled through the DAF system and has been treated, it is discharged back to the municipal water supply. However, if the location has reuse technology installed, the treated wastewater may also be recirculated for reuse.WATER PERFORMANCE AND DATA Our Rental business is the overwhelming driver of our company's water interactions. Our ongoing operational review has helped us more fully identify opportunities for how we work with water. The water data in this year's report includes all of our Rental processing locations in the United States and Canada.Water Intensity Decreases Since FY'19 As our business has continued to grow and we've processed more product volume, we've significantly invested in decreasing our business's water requirements.With the increase in output at our processing locations, we continue to realize the impact of our efforts to reduce our overall water needs. Since FY'19, we have lowered our water intensity by almost 21% - even as revenues have grown by almost 14%.Lowering Water Requirements Our ongoing efforts to innovate, increase efficiency, and explore reuse opportunities have resulted in significant reductions in our water needs.Our Operational Excellence and Reliability initiatives have helped our machines work more efficiently. With wash chemistry programmed to meet specific product load weights, our washers and dryers are more efficient - requiring less water and energy and fewer chemicals to clean, and less energy to dry. Our employee-partners continue to work with our wash chemistry and equipment vendors to target optimal product load sizes.Since FY'19, we have lowered our water withdrawal by 9.1%, our water discharge by 9.8%, and our total water consumed by 2.8%. We're using the water we draw in more effectively and increasing the amount we return to local municipal water systems.We expect our efforts to increase water-reuse opportunities will bear additional impact in coming years, further helping to lower our overall water withdrawal and consumption.Water-Stressed Regions We put significant attention on our water stewardship in areas experiencing water stress. Since FY'19, we've lessened our water withdrawn in these regions by 11.7%. In FY'22, our business withdrew 18.7% of our total water withdrawal in stressed regions, but only consumed 13.9% of our total water consumption in the same areas.As a company, we discharge 88.9% of the water we withdraw back to municipalities, but in water-stressed regions that total is up to 91.8%.Overall we consume 11.1% of the total water we withdraw as a company, but that total is even lower in water-stressed regions, at 8.2%.Our efforts to optimize existing water-reuse systems and explore further reuse opportunities in water-stressed regions are contributing to our lower water requirements in these important areas.Read moreCintas, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cintas on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: CintasWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cintasEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: CintasView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745193/Water-Stewardship-at-Cintas]"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Cintas, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$8.4b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2022).Thus, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.9% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Cintas roceIn the above chart we have measured Cintas' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Cintas' ROCE Trending?Cintas' ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 52% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.What We Can Learn From Cintas' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Cintas has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Cintas   you'll probably want to know about.Cintas is not the only stock earning high returns.

58,ec1bc224-cf05-3f03-9d5a-36152eb1c514,WMT,2023-03-23,How drone company Zipline turned one country’s logistical nightmare into a foundation for success,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-company-zipline-turned-one-163000821.html,1679502600,STORY,['WMT'],"[On this week’s episode of Fortune‘s Leadership Next podcast, co-hosts Alan Murray and Ellen McGirt talk with Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton about building the largest commercial drone delivery system in the world. Their wide-ranging conversation covers: the reasons Zipline launched by partnering with countries that are ""consistently underestimated""; the company's new home delivery technology; and, according to Cliffton, why ""the way we solve humanity-scale problems is with engineering and technology.""Later, Fortune senior writer Jessica Mathews joins Murray and McGirt to talk about the state of the drone delivery market and, even more importantly, where it's going.Listen to the episode or read the full transcript below.TranscriptAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are super focused on how CEOs can lead in the context of disruption and evolving societal expectations.Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray. I'm here with Ellen McGirt, my co-host, who just keeps getting better and better and better. Hi, Ellen.Ellen McGirt: Hi, Alan. What a delightful introduction. Very zippy, one might say.Murray: I got that—zip.McGirt: Thank you. Our guest today is equally zippy, but actually might be changing the world. He's Keller Rinaudo Cliffton. He's the founder and CEO of Zipline, the world's largest commercial drone delivery system. Since the company's founding in 2014, Zipline's autonomous electric aircrafts, smartly called ""Zips,"" have delivered hundreds of thousands of packages to people around the world, and it's planning to complete 1 million deliveries by the end of 2023.Murray: Yeah, that's right, Ellen. I've been watching this company for almost a decade. Initially, they were delivering vital items like medicine and vaccines and personal protective equipment to people in remote African villages, which was a great way to test the concept. But they have big ambitions. So they started in Rwanda in 2016. They've expanded into Ghana, Nigeria, but also now in Japan, and in the U.S.Story continuesMcGirt: It really is amazing. And believe it or not, I got the first ever pitch for what they were doing in 2015 in Rwanda while reporting a story for Fortune. So it was amazing to hear how far they've come. We got a chance to talk to Keller about how Zipline views its partnerships with the African countries you mentioned as just that—and that that's important—that they're partnerships. This is not philanthropic aid. This is not a gift. But before that, we also talked to Keller about the consumer delivery side of his business, which includes a massive partnership with Walmart that started in 2021.Murray:  eah, Ellen, that's right. I mean, the day may be coming when we all have Zipline drones coming to our doors with vital packages. Their consumer delivery business is expanding. We actually had to sit on this interview for about a month, because Zipline had some big news they were waiting to break, and it just came last week. They announced four new domestic delivery partnerships in the U.S., including three regional health care systems and Sweetgreen.McGirt: That's amazing. I'm looking forward to having my Fortune magazine delivered by Zip sometime in the future, too.Murray: Right to your door.McGirt: Right to my door, that essential print information. All of this though is a pretty major step towards having these little Zips delivering everything we need to our backyards instantly, a lot of interesting implications and opportunities there, which Keller will get into.Murray: And later in the episode, we're going to hear from Fortune's very own Jessica Mathews, who had the opportunity to go and see a Walmart Zip delivery in action in Arkansas. So she's going to tell us a bit about that and share some more context about the drone delivery market.McGirt: She's amazing, and we're going to learn a lot from Jessica. But first here's our conversation with Keller Rinaudo Cliffton of Zipline.Murray: So Keller, we're big fans of what you've been doing. You recently reached a half million deliveries, drone delivery, you're saving lives in Africa. But tell us the origin story. You started this in 2014. Tell us what was going on. How did you get going?Keller Rinaudo Cliffton: You know, our backgrounds were in automation, robotics, and software. And it seemed like there was a huge amount of technological innovation happening, but there weren't that many really cool products being built that were actually impacting normal people's lives. So we always kind of felt like, if we could take some of that technology that you see in academic robotics labs and then apply it to problems at global scale that could have a big impact in people's lives, that'd be a great thing to focus on.The more we learned about automation and focused on automation, it seemed so obvious that logistics was the right place to start. Logistics is this massive global industry that, if you're in the richest billion people on Earth, you tend to sort of just take it for granted that it works well. And then if you're not in that category, 7 billion people on Earth have bad to no access to logistics. And we felt like there was a big transformation coming in logistics toward zero emission, autonomous 10 times faster, new modes of delivery, and that if we were going to build that kind of logistics system, we wanted to build the first logistics system that would serve all people equally.Murray: Keller, you started in Africa and you started in health care, which in retrospect, turned out to be brilliant, right? I assume you are the world's largest autonomous drone delivery company.Cliffton: By several orders of magnitude, yes.Murray: No one's even close. And so the question then is okay, it was a very smart move. Are you limiting yourself to health care in Africa, or where do you go from here? I mean, this is potentially a huge market, this last-mile delivery market with autonomous drone delivery. What is Zipline's ambition?Cliffton: Yeah, you're right, Alan. I mean, for the first seven years of the company's history, you know, health care has always really been our bread and butter. But interestingly and again, you know, taking Rwanda I mean, Zipline, then launched in Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, we actually just had our first commercial flights in Kenya two days ago. We also operate now, scaling quickly, in the U.S. and Japan. We leaned into those opportunities. The fact that Rwanda invested early and led the world being a role model showing how this technology can be used to save lives. Now, they want to apply that same technology and infrastructure to all these other national priorities, and we're incredibly excited to support those efforts.Murray: And so just to follow on that, you didn't necessarily start in Africa. But you did start in Africa. Why Africa, is the answer to that question?Cliffton: Well, once we knew that we were focusing on logistics, you know, we knew it was going to be hard to get regulatory approval to build this kind of a system. And it was pretty clear to us that we needed to focus on the most important use cases out there if we wanted customers who'd be willing to take that initial risk with us building something like this. And if we wanted a regulator who would support it. We wanted to focus on a country that had a public health care system so that immediately ruled out the U.S. And we had a sense that it would probably be a small country that would move quickly, and so we ended up in 2016 partnering with the government of Rwanda. Our initial goal was to serve every hospital and health facility and deliver all medical products in the entire country. But at the time, the minister of health pushed back and she said, ""Look, just do blood. You know, here are 21 hospitals. Deliver blood to these 21 hospitals and prove that that can work."" And the reason it was a good idea is that blood's really hard, from a logistics perspective. You have all these different types, platelets, plasma cryoprecipitate, it's packed red blood cellsjust a total logistics nightmare for the health system, and 50% of transfusions were going toward moms with postpartum hemorrhaging, and 30% were going toward kids. So in 2016, where everybody thought, you know, this was never going to work. We were told by every expert out there that we spoke to in global public health care that this wasn't going to work. But luckily, this one minister of health believed in Zipline at that time, and we started to begin to delivering to those 21 hospitals. And since then, Zipline has expanded from 21 hospitals to about 400 hospitals and health facilities across Rwanda. We expanded from delivering just blood to all medical products, now a wide variety of other products on top of that, and then we expanded into seven more countries. So today, Zipline serves about 3,400 hospitals and health facilities. It's become the largest commercial autonomous system on Earth of any kind. And we're on track to be serving 10,000 hospitals and health facilities by the end of this year, just based on contracts that Zipline has already signed.McGirt: Wow, you know, I've been on reporting trips studying rural health systems in Rwanda, Malawi, and Nigeria, and I was actually there reporting a story on Bono's work for Fortune. That's a person I know you know well. So, I have a firsthand sense of how how complex this is, you know, from start to finish. And it strikes me particularly, when you're working with health systems and governments, particularly post conflict or still emerging economies, that that's State Department-level complex, right? It becomes bigger than logistics. Could you talk to us a little bit about—you're nodding. Okay, you see, you see where I'm going with this—can you talk to us about what you needed to learn, or what you've learned about these kinds of complex partnerships?Cliffton: You know, we've been lucky in that I think a lot of these countries have been perennially or, you know, just consistently underestimated. Like, I think so many people think that innovation, Oh, it'll start in the U.S. and Japan, and then over time, it'll trickle its way out to these other countries. That just isn't what's happening. And I think it's kind of fascinating to see a lot of countries that are small, classified as developing economies, but they are willing to move fast. They're super hungry for innovation and they know that to lead the world and catch up, they need to take risk and actually lead in new kind of transformational areas of technology. So, you know, in many cases, I don't know if I have anything super smart, other than it's just about partnership.And when we started, I was talking to President [Paul] Kagame [of Rwanda] yesterday and we were kind of reminiscing about 2016. I asked him, you know, we were a team of 15 nerds then. Why on Earth did you make that bet on us? And he said, Look, if it worked it was going to be totally transformational for the country. And if it didn't work, it wasn't that big of a deal. And he was like, I thought it probably wouldn't work but it seemed worth trying. And, you know, that is actually a sort of revolutionary attitude for a government leader to take. That's typically not how governments work. And I think over seven years, that partnership has really blossomed. Today Zipline delivers 75% of the national blood supply of Rwanda, outside of Kigali, fully autonomously and instantly, as well as everything else, you know, infusions, transfusions, infusions, vaccines—we can talk more about that in a sec. But we've also, you know, they have all these other national priorities. We started focusing on childhood malnutrition with them. We started focusing on agricultural productivity and animal health care. We're now a major deliverer of artificial insemination products in the country, as crazy as that sounds, for cows and pigs and chickens, because this is how you increase the productivity of farmers. They are building a new national postal service. We're working with them to to do that on top of Zipline infrastructure. So this has been a seven-year partnership and I think it just all comes down to trust, and year after year executing against what you promised.[Music starts]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, who is the CEO of Deloitte and had the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Thanks for being with us and thanks for your support.Joe Ucuzoglu: Thanks, Alan. Pleasure to be here.Murray: So Joe, this new wave of business technology, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, the ability to make intelligence out of data, is creating huge opportunities for companies. But a lot of the CEOs I talk to feel daunted by it. It's like, where do they get the imagination to rethink their entire corporation? How do they deal with that?Ucuzoglu: The opportunities are immense, particularly when you look at not just any one of these technologies individually, but the convergence of all of them collectively, creating the opportunity to truly transform business models. And I know it can seem daunting, but the reality is taking a first step in actually produces a huge benefit. Because what we're finding is that many of the cutting-edge applications are not coming out of the corporate headquarters. They're coming out of putting the technology in the hands of our people on the front lines. They find new and innovative uses, we then funnel them back up and leverage them across the entire client base.Murray: Yeah, it really gets to the importance of a culture of innovation at the company.Ucuzoglu: It is essential that our people feel empowered to take the latest and greatest and to find new and innovative ways to use it for productive purposes.Murray:  Thank you, Joe.Ucuzoglu: Alan, it's a real pleasure.[Music ends]Cliffton: Everything that Zipline has been operating over the last seven years is really what we think of as our enterprise product. That's a product designed specifically to deliver to hospitals, health facilities, and businesses. And obviously that product has scaled exponentially over the last couple of years. To put it into perspective this yea with that platform, we'll do two times as many deliveries this year, as we did in all previous seven years of the history of the company combined. We're doing about a million flights this year, and then we're going to repeat that feat next year. So it's in the middle of a really exciting, crazy exponential ramp. But all of our customers, you know, for the last four or five years has been very clear: There's really this one fundamental capability that is needed, is very hard to do well, but it's going to change the world when it actually exists and scales. And that's automated home delivery. So all of the customers that we work with really want the ability to have, we often jokingly talk about it as teleportation. They want to be able to teleport products directly to customers homes 10 times as fast in a more cost effective way and zero emission. And so that is a big transformation that's occurring. What we just announced is Zipline has spent the last four years quietly building this next generation home delivery technology. And there are a whole bunch of different customers in the U.S. and in a lot of the African countries that we serve who have already signed on to adopt this home delivery service and start delivering to millions of homes at scale, both across health care as well as other verticals.Murray: Are we talking Walmart, Amazon, or do we not know yet?Cliffton: Walmart is one of our biggest customers in the U.S. We've been working with them for about two years. In fact, Zipline has a distribution center set up in Bentonville in partnership with Walmart, and we've been operating that distribution center for the last year and seeing the customer response to instant delivery has just been completely mind blowing. I mean, it's funny, we often joke, because we saw this in Africa and now we definitely are seeing it in Bentonville. You know we have this benefit of customers thinking it's so cool and sci-fi. For about seven days they're in complete amazement. Wow, you can press a button on your phone and have an autonomous aircraft deliver exactly what you need five minutes later. And then on day eight people are completely bored by it but they're also totally entitled.Murray: I want it now.McGirt: Where's my drone?Cliffton: I've had a doctor look at her watch, and then look at me and say, it's 30 seconds late, with a scowl on her face. Yeah, it's amazing how quickly we as humans, we go from science fiction to entitlement in about seven days. And we've seen that exact same thing happen for a lot of our U.S. customers. You know, we have customers who are placing orders many times a month as families, they rely on it completely. It's completely normal and boring at this point. But you know, we deliver 24,000 of the 29,000 SKUs of that Walmart store that we're attached to. And yeah, it's I mean, it's it's kind of amazing to see the level of adoption.McGirt: Congratulations. That is good news.Cliffton: Oh, thanks.Murray: Yeah, Keller, two questions about this about the service, particularly now that you're talking about moving into the U.S. starting in Bentonville. One is the economics. Like, when does it make sense? If you're going to deliver me a life saving medicine or life saving blood supply, then obviously, that's extremely valuable. If I say I need a new toothpaste, a new toothbrush, and I'd like it in five minutes, that's probably not going to be a good case for drone delivery. So question one is when do the economics work for drone delivery? And then question two is you started in Africa because you thought it'd be easier to deal with regulators. When you get into Bentonville you're in FAA territory. How is the regulatory issue working for you in the U.S.?Cliffton: So you know, from a unit economics perspective, I think this is another one where people just don't quite have an intuition for how much the system has scaled. You know, it's seven years of operationally evolving and improving. All of Zipline's mature distribution centers today are gross margin positive. And in fact, by the end of this year, Zipline on a continent-level basis, all the continents where we operate will also be fully gross margin positive on a continent basis, including our sort of young, nascent distribution centers that are still scaling and so may not yet be profitable themselves. You know, when you think about the big picture, I mean, yes, certainly, there's a generally a higher willingness to pay for an emergency medical product being delivered to save someone's life. But instant delivery is a very well understood market both in the U.S. and globally. There'll be billions of instant deliveries done in the U.S. this year alone, and we're using a 3,000 pound gas combustion vehicle driven by a human to deliver something that weighs, on average, five pounds. And this is quite insane. If you're reasoning from a physics or first principles perspective. That is surprisingly slow, it's very expensive, and it is catastrophically bad for the environment. So actually, already, the services that Zipline is operating across all these different verticals generally out compete on price alone, using a human driving a 3000 pound gas combustion vehicle to do the same delivery and probably shouldn't be all that surprising that it does.McGirt: I want to move into philosopher king territory a little bit here, Keller, if that's okay with you. Alan, this is always his favorite part of these interviews. I learned when I was preparing that the precursor company to this, [hard to hear], which made a really adorable robot, like really just adorable, was originally a Kickstarter business, Alan.Murray: Oh, wow.McGirt: I know. We just talked to the CEO yesterday for this podcast. So it's a wonderful legacy there. But you've been doing this for a while. You had one of the best demo days of the Seattle Techstar era. I remember that. And you were an exciting entrance. Unexpected, but you know, definitely part of the of the zeitgeist of last decade. I'm curious about two things. One is your extraordinary sense of purpose. You know, you've mentioned it several times. You've mentioned the environment. You've mentioned making sure that everybody has access to the critical things that they need. When did this become part of your personal operating principle? And when did you know that you could build a business on this?Cliffton: One of the convictions that we've had since we started building Zipline was that working on something this hard, I mean, hardware is hard. It's expensive. It's risky. You sort of have these existential crises where you're bringing a new product to market and you have to figure out manufacturing and supply chain and engineering and operations. The only thing that has really driven us, the thing that's enabled us to build the team that Zipline currently has that, you know, has been able to deliver on these goals that everybody else thought were impossible, has been Zipline's mission and the fact that we believe very strongly that the most important problems that humanity faces are not going to be solved with philanthropy because philanthropy doesn't scale to serve 7 billion people. The most important problems that humanity faces are only going to be solved with technological innovation brought to bear by mission-driven for- profit companies. This is something that we felt very strongly about. And, you know, when it comes to something like logistics, healthcare logistics, building the first logistics system that serves all people equally, this is an area where profit and purpose are fully aligned. We always had these dreams that like, Hey, if we could, if we could make health care logistics better this, this probably would have a bigger, big impact on patient health. We never knew for sure, you know, the University of Pennsylvania just published a study a couple months ago showing that Zipline has been able to reduce maternal mortality at the hospitals we serve by 88%.McGirt: Wow.Cliffton: There's a study in The Lancet from a year ago showing that Rwanda has been able to reduce its national blood waste rate by 67%, for example. So we're just scratching the surface of starting to get to show the impact of better logistics enables these other major institutions that we depend on, like health care systems, to serve patients better, save money, save lives.Murray: Which kind of leads to the obvious next question, Keller. I mean, you didn't put a number on the total addressable market but everything you said indicates it's massive, it's huge. I mean, if, if it can be economic for all kinds of products, and the whole world wants instant delivery, and needs instant delivery would make lives better in so many ways. At what point does Zipline sell to a FedEx or UPS or a Walmart? Or even a manufacturer? Or somebody who can take you to scale faster? Or can you do it by yourself?Cliffton: Well, the great news is, you know, Zipline has really not had to do things by ourselves. We've been able to partner with some of the most innovative governments and countries and companies in the world. You know, two of those companies you mentioned are customers to Zipline. So you know, both UPS and Walmart are two of our biggest customers. And, and so, I don't think you know, we never think of it as we have to go it alone. The reality is, it is 12:01 a.m., when it comes to this industry. It's so early, and I often joke with our team, you know, although we're almost about to cross 40 million commercial autonomous miles. I think it's easy to look what Zipline has already done and think, you know, that's cool. That's impressive scale. The reality is we're going to  look back on this in 10 years, and it's going to seem so incredibly primitive. It will blow our minds that it ever worked at all. There is a huge amount of innovation and evolution that is still happening with the technology. We're in the very first inning. And so to me conversations about selling the company or something like that, it's just, you know, we're having a lot of fun. We know exactly what the mission of Zipline is. Zipline has a lot of the best investors in the world backing us. And we do believe that someone is going to build an automated logistics system for Earth over the next five to 10 years. I think that that company is going to be not just one of the most economically valuable companies on Earth, but I also think it will have a tremendously positive impact on humanity as a whole. And so life is short.Murray: Go for it.McGirt: Before I let you go, I just want to circle back on the perfect sort of Zipline story, the delivery story for anybody who may not be fully aware of how it operates. So my setup is going to be I'm standing in a rural village in Rwanda, and the local health care worker needs something. What do they do?Cliffton: The way automated logistics works, the way that Zipline builds it, we want it to be incredibly simple to use. There's a lot of technological complexity that happens in the background. And not only does Zipline need to build autonomous aircraft and design battery packs, but we also have to design all the avionics, we have to write all of the software, the multi-vehicle deconfliction algorithms, the data logging the, you know, automated preflight checks, air traffic control software that we provide to regulators. Alan, you asked about the FAA. All of those things have to work. But at the end of the day, none of our customers care about any of that complexity. All our customers care about is teleportation. Does the thing go from point A to point B fast enough to impact a patient's life or save a life or create an important opportunity for business? And so from from a customer perspective, this system really is as simple as pull out a phone, press a button in an app or place a phone call, and then we'll deliver to your GPS coordinates, you know, somewhere between five and 45 minutes later, depending on how far away from our distribution center you are.McGirt: My question goes back to the underestimated innovators out there that you mentioned. I was so happy to hear you mentioned them that you know, there's all kinds of people around the world who don't have pedigree access. They don't even have ramen money or the vibe to get to pattern match with a with an investor. What do you think needs to happen in the investor ecosystem to make sure that the next great idea out there doesn't get lost in the shuffle?Cliffton: It's such an important point. And, you know, a lot of our partners, for example, you know, some of the countries we work with in Africa, you know, you constantly hear this refrain of we want trade, not aid. Trade, not aid. I think this is something that the people in the U.S. haven't quite gotten, like through their heads, which is, you know, these countries want economic growth, economic independence, you know, they want jobs, foreign direct investment, technology and entrepreneurship. And I think that the reality is, you know, even some, when Zipline was starting in the early days, I think a lot of people said, well, you know, are you going be able to hire like the right kinds of teams? Are you going to be able to get access to the talent that you need in these countries? That bias was so far from the reality. I mean, the operations teams Zipline has been able to build across Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, are not only as strong as the operations teams we've hired in the U.S., some of the people leading operations in the U.S. we pulled from our Africa teams because our African teams are actually the ones who know how to operate this technology at scale, and have been doing so for the last seven years. So it's not even a matter of equality, it's a matter of, you know, these countries are leading the way. They are the paradigm for how technology is being applied to the problems that are most important for humanity to solve over the next 10 to 20 years.Last time I checked, and maybe I have these numbers a little wrong, but there are about $4 trillion of foreign direct investment happening in the world every year. And almost none of that is flowing into these countries that actually have a lot of the problems that are most pressing and urgent to, to solve at a humanity level. You know, I read the other day 75, like something like 75% of births over the last over the next 50 years are going to occur in Africa. Isn't that mind blowing? So I think we have this sense that like, oh, that's for philanthropy. So if you're starting a technology company, let's focus on serving, you know, rich people who happen to live on the coasts of this one country or something like that. But the reality is, the way we solve humanity-scale problems is with engineering and technology. And by taking the you know, the smartest people graduating from the best schools and applying them to these humanities scale problems. I'm not saying it isn't important to go and help a search engine sell like .001% more ads. I mean, someone has to do that, too, I suppose. But what I know for sure, is we have got to get the smartest minds of my generation, of the next generation focused on these important mission-driven humanity-scale problems. And there's a role for investors to play because if we start to show that you can actually build valuable technology companies serving these kinds of markets, solving these problems, then capitalism is ultimately the driving force that's going to enable these solutions to scale and serve billions of people.Murray: It's so impressive, I have to say. You came to Fortune Brainstorm Health in the early days. Maybe it was 2015 or 2016? When you were just really getting your first Rwanda projects off the ground. Really impressive to see what you've done and to imagine where it might go. And thank you for articulating it so well. You are changing the world. And as you said, you're just at the very, very beginning of what can be done so keep it up. We'll be watching. We'll have you back in 10 more years, and you can tell us where you are then.Cliffton: It's a big honor. Thank you for inviting me.McGirt:  So after talking to Keller, the Leadership Next team was curious to learn even more about the drone delivery market that Zipline is a part of—where it's at where it's going and what challenges it's facing. So we sat down with Fortune senior writer Jessica Mathews. She reports on VCs and startups and writes Fortune's Term Sheet newsletter. She's written about Zipline and the drone delivery market a few times. In late 2021 she actually had the chance to visit the airport in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, where Walmart dispatches deliveries using Zipline's drones. She explains how that visit came to be.Jessica Mathews: Yeah, so it's kind of a funny story. One of my friends actually was shopping at the Pea Ridge Walmart and saw some drones flying behind the store and called me up almost immediately after and said, ""Hey, you have to come check this out. There's drones flying around Pea Ridge, Arkansas."" I of course was super fascinated. So I reached out and asked if I could get a tour to see what they had going on. It was shortly before they launched their initial testing service with Walmart.McGirt: Unfortunately, the day Jessica went to Pea Ridge, it was raining, so no drones were able to take off. This is because of visibility regulations we will talk about in a moment. But she did see a Walmart box being stuffed with healthcare and pharmacy items and attached to the drone before it went through safety checks and was set on the runway for its eventual takeoff.Mathews: So Zipline was the first drone site that I ever visited. I've been to a few more now. So at the time I remember thinking the technology was just really exciting. But I think I was personally just really surprised at how far that the technology had come and what it was capable of. Because again, you're not seeing drones actually delivering stuff to people on a large scale yet and so it still feels very futuristic, even though in a lot of cases, the technology is actually there, the drones are operational. It was just really exciting to get to see in person.McGirt: So yes, the technology is there. And yes, the drones are operational. So why aren't we all seeing little Zips flying by our window dropping packages into our backyards? What's preventing consumer drone delivery from going mainstream?Mathews: There's definitely a few pieces to this. But the biggest one for sure that any drone company would tell you is regulation, and that's been the biggest hurdle for years. So the FAA, which is the government's aviation regulator, has been developing drone-specific regulation for several years now. Because right now drones operate under the same rules as airplanes, even though they're autonomous. They don't carry people. They're way lighter. They're just not as risky as airplanes. But at the same time, they're operating in airspace, so they have to meet the same regulations. That being said, the FAA has issued some exemptions and certifications that drone companies can apply for to be able to not have to follow all of the airline regulations that are out there. That being said, it's still really onerous process to go through all the regulation. There's still a lot of limitations that are basically keeping companies from able to scale this. The biggest one would be BVLOS, which means beyond visual line of sight, and there's rule that you can't fly a drone beyond a person's visual line of sight unless you have a specific exemption. Really until the FAA comes out with widespread drone-specific regulation, which they're working on now and should be out in the next few years, we're really not going to have it become an everyday part of life.McGirt: Jessica also mentioned that companies like Zipline have better luck scaling outside the U.S. because America is very protective of its airspace and the FAA's regulations are more restrictive than other countries. The FAA's timetable for establishing new regulations is unpredictable. But demand for drone delivery is high and a lot of companies are investing money to meet that demand. Zipline has big competitors like Matternet, Amazon, and Wing which is Alphabet's drone subsidiary.Mathews: I think the biggest opportunity is specifically around delivery of health supplies right now. In particular to rural communities where it's just harder to access them by roads, whether it's flooding or if there's a natural disaster. There's also just a huge opportunity for businesses in terms of efficiency and their supply chain. If you can get trucks off the road and put things in the air, there's a lot you can do for reducing emissions, which is a big priority for a lot of businesses right now. And also, if you can get to the point where you can have a scalable drone operation, then theoretically you're able to operate a whole fleet with maybe one person managing the whole fleet, and they can do so completely remotely.McGirt: There's also a bigger question of whether scaling drone delivery is good for society, for people or the environment.Mathews: I mean, I think one thing that people are concerned about is exactly that, the business efficiency. I mean, is this going to reduce jobs? And there's also questions about noise and whether it's going to disrupt people, and whether drones could potentially disrupt wildlife.McGirt: Ultimately, Jessica was clear on the most exciting and profitable opportunities for drone delivery, and those opportunities don't include having your dinner dropped from the sky onto your doorstep.Mathews: So, as exciting as it might be to think about getting your Ben &amp; Jerry's delivered to you on demand and dropped off in your backyard, the most exciting things about drone technology are the opportunity that there is to save people's lives. And that would be delivering emergency supplies after a flood or a tornado to places that are really hard to reach or dangerous for people to reach. Or also things like delivering organs or delivering blood transfusions. I think that's also where there's probably more money to be made at this point in time, too, because the demand is just higher and the need is greater. A lot of people get excited over things like oh, my Domino's Pizza is coming in the sky. DoorDash and other food delivery services have made it pretty clear it's really hard to make money in the instant delivery space, and so it might actually be more lucrative for drone companies to work with bigger businesses and hospitals and to actually work in trying to deliver emergency supplies and ways to ultimately do a better service to people anyway.Murray: Leadership Next is edited by Alexis Haut.

JWN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nordstrom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Bottom 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 2 cents per share to a loss of 7 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nordstrom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(NYSE:JWN) Suggests It's 35% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-nordstrom-inc-nyse-174432223.html,1679334272,STORY,['JWN'],"[Key InsightsNordstrom's estimated fair value is US$25.57 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityNordstrom's US$16.56 share price signals that it might be 35% undervalued Analyst price target for JWN is US$19.39 which is 24% below our fair value estimateDoes the March share price for Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$535.3mUS$479.3mUS$483.0mUS$488.4mUS$495.2mUS$503.1mUS$511.9mUS$521.3mUS$531.2mUS$541.6mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 1.11%Est @ 1.40%Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.84%Est @ 1.91%Est @ 1.96% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$472US$373US$331US$296US$264US$237US$213US$191US$172US$154(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.7bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$542m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (13%– 2.1%) = US$4.9bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.9b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$1.4bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.1b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$16.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Nordstrom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.904. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NordstromStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are hurting many companies in the space.Nevertheless, efforts to enhance store and digital operations along with robust brand enhancement endeavors keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Crocs, Inc., PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear.The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also offer fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks.The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs.Story continuesAdditionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies' margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies' performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience.

Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players' growth.

Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. Companies in the space have long been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic boosted the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

66,d2e47c03-0ae3-372b-9c33-4d2f993b58bc,XYL,2023-03-23,"‘Half of the global population could face water scarcity by 2025,’ according to UNICEF. Here are 2 water treatment stocks to watch now",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/half-global-population-could-face-001714629.html,1679530634,STORY,"['PNR', 'XYL']","[“Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.”So wrote Coleridge, in his epic poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and while most of us probably won’t get trapped in the doldrums on the equator, we probably should give more thought to water.To start with, water shortages are far more common than are usually assumed. As Jim Andrew, chief sustainability officer of PepsiCo, points out, more than 2 billion people worldwide don’t have regular access to safe water for drinking or washing, and another 4 billion people deal with such shortages for at least one month per year. In recent decades, as the global population has increased, so have the pressures on the world’s supply of fresh water. In fact, according to UNICEF, half of the global population could face water scarcity challenges by 2025.As pressures on water systems and supplies increase, it’s only natural that more companies and innovators will step up to meet the challenge – to develop water handling equipment of greater efficiency, able to maintain and move supplies with less waste.Against this backdrop, we’ve looked up the details on two interesting stocks that operate in just this field, producing water handling equipment for a wide range of purposes. According to TipRanks database, these are Buy-rated equities with double-digit upside potential – and even better, each has found recent approval from one of the Street’s 5-star analysts.Xylem, Inc. (XYL)First up is Xylem, a water technology provider based in New York State. The company’s customers include public utilities, industrial firms, and residential, commercial, and agricultural water suppliers, and Xylem does business in over 150 countries. The company works in both water infrastructure and wastewater transport and treatment, and its products include pumps, valves, heat exchangers, dispensing equipment, and treatment and testing equipment.While Xylem’s stock has been volatile lately, the company has shown positive financial results in recent quarters. The most recent report, from 4Q22, tells the story.Story continuesIn that recent quarter, Xylem’s top and bottom line both beat expectations. At the top line, the revenue total of $1.5 billion was $90 million higher than the forecasts, while at the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS of 92 cents beat the forecast by 13 cents, or 16%. On a year-over-year basis, the quarterly revenues were up 13.5%, and the EPS was up 46%.In January of this year, Xylem announced that it had entered a ‘definitive agreement’ to acquire the water treatment technology firm Evoqua. The transaction will be conducted entirely in stock, and the combined entity will have an estimated enterprise value of $7.5 billion.Also of note, earlier this month the City of Buffalo announced that the partnership between the Buffalo Sewer Authority and the Xylem had improved the city’s ability to prevent system overflows, and had contributed to $145 million in savings for the municipality.Covering this stock for Stifel, 5-star analyst Nathan Jones sees the Evoqua deal as a key point, and writes of Xylem’s prospects: “We think Xylem’s clearly laid-out strategy to build the leading global smart water infrastructure company, while significantly improving the operations of the company over the next several years, provides the potential for solid investment returns over the long run in lower-volatility water markets. With the announcement of the acquisition of Evoqua Water Technologies, we believe this is a low risk acquisition and integration with strong opportunity to drive higher growth together than alone coupled with compelling cost synergies opportunities.”For Jones, this adds up to a Buy rating on the shares, and his $124 price target implies a one-year gain of 27% for Xylem. (To watch Jones’ track record, click here)Overall, XYL shares have picked up 9 recent analyst reviews, and these include 4 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $97.57 and its $118.43 average price target suggests an upside potential of 21% on the one-year time frame. (See XYL stock forecast)Pentair plc (PNR)The second water treatment stock we’ll check out is Pentair, a company focused on ‘smart, sustainable water solutions.’ The company markets its products to industrial water management companies, residential and commercial water suppliers, and agribusinesses. Pentair’s product line includes water supply and disposal, pool and spa equipment, water softeners and filters, filter housings, supply and disposal pumps, as well as valves, tanks, and accessories.Pentair has shown a consistent ability to beat its earnings forecasts, and maintained that in its last quarterly report. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company showed a bottom line non-GAAP EPS of 82 cents; while this was down from 87 cents in the prior year quarter, it beat the analyst forecast by 3 cents. At the top line, the company posted quarterly revenues of $1 billion, up a modest 1.45% y/y, and $9.51 million ahead of expectations.Along with these quarterly beats, Pentair finished the year with $364 million in cash from operations and $283 million in annual free cash flow. In February, the company announced its next quarterly dividend payment, scheduled for May 5 at a rate of 22 cents per common share. While the annualized payment of 88 cents only yields a modest 1.66%, the dividend is highly reliable.For Bryan Bair, 5-star analyst with Oppenheimer, the bottom line here is that Pentair holds a solid position in its industry and is likely to continue showing gain.“We view Pentair as well positioned for MSD normalized core growth and margin/returns expansion, with benefits from healthy through-the-cycle market demand (80% resi/non-res water exposure), enhanced focus on innovation/differentiation and digital capabilities, and PIMS cost initiatives supporting above-average EPS growth. We anticipate continued/solid Pool demand (comp-related fears overdone), sustained Water Solutions growth (commercial recovery levered by high-margin Manitowoc Ice), self-help actions, and strategic capital deployment will drive further upside vs. forward earnings and cash flow expectations,” Bair opined.Against this backdrop, it’s no wonder that Bair rates PNR shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $67 implies it has a one-year upside potential of ~30%. (To watch Blair’s track record, click here)All told, Pentair gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 12 recent analyst ratings that break down to 8 Buys, 2 Holds, and 2 Sells. The stock’s average price target of $61.25 implies share appreciation of ~19% from the current trading price of $51.35.

The funds will be directed toward water-related research and development, start-up companies commercializing innovative approaches to water management, and the deployment of new water technologies. The organizations will also commit to ongoing engagement with development agencies, governments, and other stakeholders to facilitate more cross-sector action to solve water challenges.""Most of humanity’s challenges today stem from our reliance on water, whether for human life or, on a larger scale, economic well-being and prosperity of society,"" said Henk Ovink, Water Envoy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. ""We all need it, but in some places there is too much and in other places there isn’t enough. As significant water investors and users, the private sector has a pivotal role to play. The organizations pledging their commitment today are at the forefront of bringing new innovations to water use, treatment, and recycling. This type of collective action is essential to tackling major water challenges, and to creating a sustainable planet for future generations.""Story continuesThe commitment from the private and philanthropic sectors to invest in water solutions supports the UN 2023 Water Conference’s call for clear pledges and actions, across all sectors, industries, and interests to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.""For those who can simply turn on a tap, water may not seem like a problem,"" said Patrick Decker, CEO of Xylem. ""But the UN 2023 Water Conference is a timely reminder that water challenges are intensifying around the world. The organizations making commitments today recognize these are challenges we can and must solve. Many of the essential technologies already exist, but as climate change progresses, we need more innovative solutions and accelerated implementation to increase the resilience and water-security of communities everywhere.""The inclusion of the private sector in the UN 2023 Water Conference, the first event of its kind since 1977, has been welcomed as essential in developing an impactful Water Action Agenda.

Interestingly, Veolia also specializes in desalination, or the process of converting ocean water into drinking (potable) water. Since the beginning of the year, VEOEF gained over 8% of its equity value. However, it’s undervalued in the trailing year, down 13% below parity.Despite the red ink, adventurous investors of the best water utility stocks to buy should take a peek at Veolia. Regarding its financials, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 17.9%, above 70% of its peers. As well, in the past 10-year period, it posted profits in nine of them. Perhaps most attractively for prospective buyers, the market prices VEOEF at a forward multiple of 15.49.

This equates to about 14 million people via 3.4 million customer connections. Despite its relevancies, since the start of the year, AWK dropped over 7% in equity value.Still, it’s worth taking a look at one of the underrated examples of the best water utility stocks to buy. Operationally, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 7.7%, outpacing 65% of its peers. In terms of earnings, the public utility carries a net margin of 21.62%.

In the trailing year, shares fell 25%, reflecting a higher-risk profile.Nevertheless, MSEX may offer a higher reward potential in exchange for that risk. In addition, its financials aren’t that bad, at least compared to other utility firms. For example, Middlesex’s three-year EBITDA growth rate pings at 12.4%, above 69.79% of competitors. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period is 18.7%, above nearly 71% of sector players. Plus, the company enjoys strong profitability with a net margin of 26.12%. Unfortunately, its forward yield doesn’t quite reflect that at 1.63%. Still, it features 27 years of consecutive dividend increases. Finally, Robert W. Baird’s Ben Kallo pegs MSEX as a buy. The experts anticipate shares hitting $88, implying almost 15% upside potential.Xylem (XYL)Lots of water bottles.

Moving forward, it can possibly rise higher.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), XYL rates as modestly undervalued. Largely, the company’s greatest strengths arguably center on its profitability metrics. For instance, its operating margin is 11.79% in the trailing year, above 73.56% of the competition. Further, its return on equity is 10.88%, outpacing 64.31% of its peers. Presently, Xylem carries a forward yield of 1.36%.

Further, their average price target stands at $118.43, implying nearly 22% upside potential. Therefore, for sheer capital returns potential, it’s one of the best water utility stocks to buy.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Flooded quarry for limestone mining. Turquoise water. White beaches.

And in the trailing year, it’s down nearly 10%.Still, for the adventurous type, WTRG could be intriguing. Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy. If inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, consumers may have to significantly reduce their spending on non-essential items, which would negatively impact the earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector, such as clothing retailers, luxury brands, and travel firms. However, if inflation eases and the Federal Reserve successfully manages a gentle economic slowdown, these stocks could potentially lead a rebound in the markets. The consumer discretionary sector has already been heavily discounted due to the prevailing pessimism, which could create attractive investment prospects.The performance of different sectors in 2023 is expected to be heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. Investors may react positively to a decrease in inflation and the end of the Fed's rate-hike cycle, but the opposite could prolong uncertainty. The supply and demand balance will also be significant, as frequent price promotions may have a detrimental impact on retailers' profit margins. Nevertheless, consumers with higher incomes, who have more savings and spend a lower proportion of their income on basic living expenses like utilities, may continue to have strong discretionary spending. Some of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy include Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Despite reports of job cuts in the news, overall employment is still increasing. Although the number of people filing for unemployment benefits remains low, the effects of the layoffs will eventually become evident, resulting in a decline in total wages and salaries paid. Nevertheless, the impact of this downturn will be postponed due to past savings. In 2020 and 2021, the majority of the stimulus checks were saved, and higher-than-normal savings rates were also due to more generous unemployment insurance payouts and rising wage rates. Despite some uncertainty as the year progresses, the larger economic trends suggest a positive outlook for consumer spending in 2023. However, by 2024, consumers will have depleted their current earnings and savings, resulting in a significant decrease in discretionary spending. Businesses that sell to consumers should not prematurely reduce their inventory levels. Maintaining sufficient inventory is essential to capitalize on available sales opportunities. Story continuesOur Methodology For this article, we selected consumer discretionary stocks such as furniture companies, travel firms, home appliances providers, fitness-related firms, casinos, and restaurants based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To BuywithGod/Shutterstock.comBest Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy13. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) manufactures and sells home appliances in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

Credit Suisse has revised its estimates for 2023 and 2024 to $15.30 and $16.30, respectively, after the firm's initial note on the company's Q4 results. The 2023 estimate is slightly lower than management's guidance due to Credit Suisse's more conservative outlook on housing turnover, which is a major factor in appliance sales, through 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), with collective stakes worth $842.7 million. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.70 million shares worth $383.15 million. Like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. 12. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) franchises and operates fitness centers under the Planet Fitness brand. The company has three divisions – Franchise, Corporate-Owned Stores, and Equipment. It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 23, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 and a revenue of $281.3 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $9.82 million, respectively. In 2023, the company expects revenue to increase by 13% to 14% as compared to 2022, and earnings per share to increase by 33% to 36%. On February 27, Max Rakhlenko, an analyst at Cowen, increased the company's price target on Planet Fitness, Inc.

The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”11. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) operates as a play and entertainment company in the United States and internationally. The company's business is divided into three segments – Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, and Entertainment. On February 13, Hasbro, Inc.

It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 17, DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser maintained a Buy recommendation on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $80 from $95. In a research note to investors, the analyst stated that after announcing a Q4 shortfall, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)’s full-quarter report and 2023 guidance were significantly below expectations. Nonetheless, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has several top-line drivers in 2023, including toys for six blockbuster movies.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $70 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Rising inflation pressuring consumer budgets for discretionary purchases, as well as volatile currency markets, weighed on global entertainment company Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), which owns Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh and other games and brands.  The main detractors from absolute returns were positions in Microsoft, Ball, Intel, Hasbro and McCormick (MKC).”10. Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Next on our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks is Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), which operates as a gaming company in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It operates through three segments – Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas, and Midwest &amp; South. On February 14, Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) declared a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend, a 6.7% increase from its prior dividend of $0.15. The dividend is payable on April 15, to shareholders of record on March 15. On February 9, Susquehanna analyst Joseph Stauff raised the firm's price target on Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) to $80 from $72 and reiterated a Positive rating on the shares.

John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.45 million shares worth $188.50 million. Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of U.S. regional casino operator Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), increased in the fourth quarter due to stable consumer visitation and spending levels despite an uncertain macro environment. The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel. We continue to be positive on the company’s long-term prospects.”9. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. It provides burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, tacos, and salads.

The company has predicted that it will achieve 27% restaurant margins with $3 million sales volumes, a target that both Cowen and consensus forecasts anticipate will be reached in 2024. Despite this, the analyst maintained its Outperform rating and $2040 price target for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shares on February 13. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 45 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square held the largest stake in the company, comprising 1.10 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We added to our position in made-to-order burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Despite restaurants typically being seen as more sensitive to an economic downturn, the company has consistently been able to exceed expectations through its ability to pass through inflationary increases in both materials and labor through strong pricing power. Chipotle’s investments in digital technology have enabled it to leverage the higher margin delivery business, highlighted by the implementation of “Chipotlanes”, a digital drive through option in suburban areas where customers pay in advance online, to drive significant increases in restaurant volumes.”8.

Additionally, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, growth in Latin America, and early bookings for summer vacations in Europe are expected to benefit Airbnb. Argus has also revised its earnings per share estimates for FY23 and FY24 to $3.60 and $4.00, respectively, up from $3.00 and $3.60.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Airbnb, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world’s largest, well-known and fastest growing provider of short-term rental properties via a simple and intuitive online platform. The company has been benefiting from a strong recovery in travel demand so far this year, but shares have been weaker alongside growth stocks in general. Recent results showed nearly 100 million nights booked, up 25% YoY, gross booking value growth of 31% and revenue growth of 29%. We believe Airbnb will continue to generate attractive top-line growth that will outpace that of overall travel. From a demand perspective, we expect the company to continue to maintain its leadership in long-term stays and benefit from a recovery in urban, cross-border and APAC re-opening. The company has rolled out products to improve its value proposition to travelers and hosts, including “Smart Pricing” to ensure its supply continues to provide relative value to consumers, “Aircover for Hosts” to increase supply and “Categories” to better match consumer demand to available supply. Given these profit cycle tailwinds and shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we remain invested.”6. Las Vegas Sands Corp.

(NYSE:LVS), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with  2.05 million shares worth $98.7 million. In addition to Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Las Vegas Sands Corp.

(NYSE:LVS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), in the consumer discretionary sector, which owns and operates several high-profile resorts and casinos in Macau and Singapore. One of the highest probability macro events we anticipate in 2023 is a China reopening, with forecasts (and the Chinese government itself) targeting over 5% growth. A big driver of this growth will be the massive pent-up demand for travel and entertainment after almost three years of being locked down and accumulating a mountain of private savings. We felt that Las Vegas Sands was an attractively-valued opportunity to capture the Chinese reopening, and specifically an eventual rebound in Macau from historically depressed levels. Las Vegas Sands is yet another example of a name supported by strong earnings growth that should generate positive performance, regardless of recession potential, due to the downside protection afforded by its solid free cash flow generation from already reopened destinations in Singapore. When combined with the material upside as earnings and cash flow gap up on a Macau reopening, we believe the risk/reward tradeoff is heavily underappreciated from the market and were able to capitalize and enter the stock at an extremely compelling entry point.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks Disclosure: None. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
75,1fbd8b51-df62-3136-9f82-304099f0f5fc,MGM,2023-03-23,The 7 Lowest-Paying Dividend Stocks for Income Haters,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-lowest-paying-dividend-stocks-103035024.html,1679308235,STORY,"['COO', 'WTM', 'VRT', 'WIRE', 'MGM', 'NVDA', 'AMG']","[The lowest-paying dividend stocks don’t have the same cachet as their high-yielding counterparts.After all, if you are looking for your portfolio to generate steady returns and/or steady income, you obviously want to find the stocks that can provide the highest risk-adjusted return. However, if capital growth, not income, is your top investing priority, it may still be worth inspecting stocks that barely qualify as dividend-paying.For one, there may be a good reason these companies are making de minimis payouts. To maximize shareholder value, management of these companies may find it more beneficial to repurchase shares and/or reinvest earnings back into the business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlongside this, just because a stock offers a super-low dividend today, doesn’t mean that will be the case tomorrow. Paying out such a small percentage of earnings, these names may have greater potential to implement high dividend increases in the future.According to Finviz.com, these are the seven lowest-paying dividend stocks currently listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. Let’s explore each one, and see whether other factors make up for their respective tiny payouts.AMGAffiliated Managers Group$132.84COOThe Cooper Companies$340.54MGMMGM Resorts$41.12NVDANvidia$258.20VRTVertiv Holdings$13.21WIREEncore Wire$172.74WTMWhite Mountains Insurance Group$1349.45Affiliated Managers Group (AMG)6 Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuySource: ShutterstockBased in West Palm Beach, Florida, Affiliated Managers Group (NYSE:AMG) is a financial services company that owns interests in a myriad of independent investment management firms.This partnership-based approach has worked out well, as evinced by AMG’s earnings growth in recent years.But while at one point paying much of these earnings out as dividends, that ceased being the case with AMG stock in 2020. In response to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company slashed its payout by 97%, and has yet to re-raise it. At current prices, AMG’s penny-per-share quarterly dividend gives the stock a forward yield of just 0.03%.Story continuesThere is a silver lining, however. While AMG’s dividend may still be extremely low, the company has been aggressively buying back stock. Last year, it bought back $475 million worth of shares. Not too shabby, relatively to Affiliated Managers Group’s $4.87 billion market capitalization.The Cooper Companies (COO)A close-up of someone's eyeSource: ShutterstockThe Cooper Companies (NYSE:COO) is primarily known as a leading manufacturer of contact lenses, but the healthcare products company also has a large operating unit that produces products and diagnostics used in family/women’s health care.Large and established, one would expect COO stock to offer investors a decently sized dividend. However, that is not the case. At current prices, COO has a forward yield of 0.02%. Long-term investors in the company, however, likely are not complaining.Why? According to Seeking Alpha, COO cut its payout in 2002 (from 5 cents semiannually to 3 cents semiannually), and has never re-raised it. Putting its earnings to work in other ways (namely, by reinvesting into the business), this stock has produced outsized returns. If you bought COO in July 2022, when it last paid a higher dividend, you would be up 1500% on your position.MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comLike AMG, MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) is another name that became one of the lowest-paying dividend stocks because of Covid. When the virus went global in early 2020, the casino and i-gaming operator reduced its dividend to 0.25 cents per share quarterly, or just a penny per year.Thanks to the 2021 “revenge travel”‘ recovery, plus the rapid rise of online sports betting and casinos in the U.S., MGM stock has not only bounced back from its initial pandemic plunge. Shares today well above pre-Covid price levels. However, the company for now appears to be maintaining its meager payout rate.This alone isn’t a deal breaker for MGM shares, but one area of concern might be with its rich valuation. With its 2022 earnings ($3.49 per share) skewed by one time gains, MGM trades for around 65.8 times forecasted 2023 earnings.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a growth stock, but unlike other big tech names, this chip maker provides investors with a quarterly dividend. However, the rate of payout is tiny.At 4 cents per share quarterly, this dividend gives NVDA stock a forward yield of only 0.06%. With shares up over four-fold over the past five years, even after last year’s tech stock sell-off, long-term shareholders likely aren’t complaining. Still, while shares have a winning track record, that doesn’t mean buying today will produce solid returns.NVDA stock’s recent bounce-back can be chalked up to “A.I. mania.” Even if the company has big exposure to mass adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning, it’s possible the market has gone overboard pricing this catalyst into the stock, which today trades for around 57.1 times forward earnings.Vertiv Holdings (VRT)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comVertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) is a manufacturer of power and thermal management products used by data centers. In 2020, Platinum Equity, Vertiv’s private equity owner, took it public, via a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) merger.With a leveraged balance sheet from its private equity days, it’s no surprise that VRT stock ranks as one of the lowest-paying dividend stocks out there. VRT pays its investors a dividend of 1 cent per share annually, which gives the stock a forward yield of just 0.07%.Value investors may find VRT appealing. Shares trade for only 11.5 times forward earnings, and earnings are forecasted to grow by double-digits in 2024 and 2025. Increased earnings could enable the company to de-lever its balance sheet, implement a share repurchase program, and/or perhaps raise the current dividend. A low payout ratio (1.9%) provides plenty of dividend growth runway.Encore Wire (WIRE)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comAs clear from its corporate name and ticker symbol, Encore Wire (NASDAQ:WIRE) is a manufacturer of electrical wire. WIRE is yet another situation where share price growth has far outpaced dividend growth.The company first started paying shareholders 2 cents per share quarterly in January 2007, and has never raised this payout. Over this time frame, though, WIRE stock has delivered a total return of 667.5%, or 13.4% annualized.Although Encore Wire has been aggressively buying back stock since 2020, perhaps a significant dividend increase is long overdue.Currently yielding just 0.05%, WIRE has a payout ratio of only 0.22%. The company could easily raise its dividend by 1o or 20-fold. Even after an increase like that it would still have plenty of cash to fund its share repurchase efforts, but to fund future organic growth and/or acquisitions as well.White Mountains Insurance Group (WTM)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Bermuda, White Mountains Insurance Group (NYSE:WTM) is mainly a property and casualty insurer, although the company also has subsidiaries and affiliates in the asset management and insurance technology (or insurtech) spaces.With a forward yield of only 0.07%, no one is buying WTM stock for income. For growth-focused investors, however, it’s likely a different story. WTM has focused on steadily growing its book value per share for many years.In 2022, the company handily achieved this goal, with adjusted book value per share increasing by 26% during the year.This explains why WTM stock has rallied by over 30% over the past twelve months. White Mountains Insurance Group may not be able to grow book value per share by another 26% again this year, yet with its management’s focus on creating and keeping value, shares could continue to perform well over a long time horizon.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

For more cruise stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now.  One of the hardest hit sectors by the coronavirus pandemic was the cruise ship industry. While other hospitality sectors, such as hotels and restaurants had time to prepare to deal with lockdown requirements aimed to curb the spread of the virus, cruise companies were simply caught off guard. This is due to the fact that as lockdowns started to be enforced, many cruise ships were in the middle of their journeys, and were often left stranded at sea due to port and harbor closures. In fact, a little known fact about the pandemic is that one of the most widespread coronavirus outbreaks after China in fact took place on a cruise ship. This ship was the Diamond Princess which has more than a thousand guest cabins and roughly the same number of crews.The ill fated vessel began its journey in late January and saw its passenger and crew count swell to almost four thousand people. All of these were left stranded at the Tokyo harbor in Japan for almost a month after initial reports surfaced that two elderly passengers that had gotten off the ship in Hong Kong had tested positive for the deadly virus. Matters took a serious turn when ten passengers on board the Diamond Princess tested positive and the ship remained in limbo stuck at Tokyo for 27 days, with 14 passengers dying and 712 becoming infected.However, the Diamond Princess was not the only ship stuck due to the virus. According to a Guardian investigation, more than one hundred thousand cruise ship crew members were left stranded at sea due to the virus, and many of them would die in the waters as well. In terms of economic costs, research from Russian maritime universities show that they are simply unbelievable. The researchers point out that between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of the first quarter of 2020, cruise companies saw their profits drop from $30 billion to just $50 million, for an almost complete decimation. The pandemic also put several companies out of business, as the total number of cruise companies dropped from 93 to 81 as the virus wreaked havoc all over the world.Story continuesThe pandemic also shook the perception of the cruise liner industry. A natural language processing (NLP) analysis of the tweets related to the industry conducted by researchers in Spain showed that the majority of sentiment surrounding the industry was negative. The analysis revealed that widespread media coverage of the pandemic combined with previously held beliefs about the cruise industry as being a 'petri dish' for diseases contributed significantly to negative sentiment, and it cautioned that this sentiment can continue even as the pandemic settles and life goes back to normal. Since this raises the question of whether people would be willing to take a cruise after the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, brief research reveals that researchers from the U.K. and Australia try to answer these very questions. By using a questionnaire through a research panel, they determined that risk perceptions related to cruise traveling were based on the participants' home country, with respondents from Australia having a more negative outlook when compared to those from the U.K. It also found out that the coronavirus pandemic was unique in the sense that it led to an experience agnostic perception about the future intention to take a cruise, which was in opposition to previous viruses that had seen people with previous cruise ship experiences having more positive intentions.With the worst behind it, a research report from Grand View Market Research estimates that the global cruise market was worth $7.25 billion in 2021 and that it grew to $7.67 billion in 2022. It adds that from 2022 onwards, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2022 to 2028 to sit at $15 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm adds that within the market, the river cruise segment will be the fastest growing and that it will outpace the broader industry by growing at 13.3%. According to Grand View Market Research, the ocean cruise segment was the largest segment in the market in 2021, as it accounted for 80% of the total revenues.After the coronavirus bloodbath, the industry is well on its way to recovery, with the chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), Mr. Jason Liberty, outlining during a recent earnings call in February 2023:We finished 2022 on a high note and are entering 2023 with the full strength of our operating and commercial platforms.

Our products appeal to a broad range of vacationers with everything from a short getaway to Perfect Day to a luxury world cruise. Cruising remains an exceptionally attractive value proposition.

NCLH is likely to benefit from improving occupancy, sequential improvement in booking activities and fleet expansion efforts. This and the focus on cost saving initiatives bode well. However, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions pose concerns.Let us discuss why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.Key CatalystsNorwegian Cruise is benefitting from improvements in occupancy. In fourth-quarter 2022, occupancy was approximately 87%, in line with the company’s expectations. In the previous quarter, the company had reported an occupancy of 82%. During the quarter, the company reported sequential improvements in load factor, with a sequential gap reduction (of about 20%) from 2019 levels. The company anticipates occupancy ramp-up to continue and reach historical levels (of 100% plus) during the second quarter of 2023. Relaxation in COVID-related protocols is likely to add to the positives.Sequential improvements in booking activities have been aiding the company. The bookings include incorporating higher pricing and the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (FCCs). During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported solid booking volumes courtesy of strong demand in the WAVE season. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 is higher than 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $2.7 billion, reflecting a hike of 9% (from the previous quarter) and 30% (from 2019 levels). The company stated pricing levels to be elevated. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods.The company emphasizes on its booking window to drive top-line. The initiative not only evaluates the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel but also provides better visibility for price increases and moderating marketing expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the booking window remained elongated compared with 2019 levels. The company anticipates the indicator to be a driving factor of sales in the upcoming periods. Also, emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Norwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size to drive growth. It has plans to introduce eight more ships through 2027. Most are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. For the Regent brand, it has one Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has two Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025. For the Norwegian brand, the company has five Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2023 through 2028. The company anticipates the additions to increase the birth count to approximately 82,000. In 2023, the company anticipates the additions of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruises Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to its fleet.Story continuesConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past three months, shares of the company have declined 5.4% against the industry’s rise of 4.5%. The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also, geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, the management has decided to withdraw all activity in Russia. The company anticipates the close-end nature of the deployment change and its inability to find alternatives for the itineraries to disrupt booking patterns for some time.Norwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the fourth quarter of 2022, total cruise operating expenses increased 69.9% year over year to $1,219.5 million. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. The company noted that the increase in 2022 reflects an improvement in payroll, fuel, and direct variable costs of fully operating ships. Also, inflationary pressures relating to food, perishables, and logistics added to the woes. The company anticipates inflation and global supply chain constraints to pressurize margins in the near term.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderNorwegian Cruise currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Microchip Tech is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Microchip Tech imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Microchip TechThis chipmaker is expected to earn $6 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 30.2%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Microchip Tech. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Microchip Tech to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DRI, The Interpublic Group of Companies IPG, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP and Valero Energy VLO.5 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks to Counter Market VolatilityDividend investing gained popularity in recent weeks as the banking crisis ignited worries about a broader credit crunch and liquidity strains across the market. This is especially true as dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Darden Restaurants Inc., The Interpublic Group of Companies, Microchip Technology Inc. and Valero Energy — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill:India-based Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an integrated global pharmaceutical company engaged in providing affordable and innovative medicines since 1984. The company has an estimated earnings growth of 45.1% for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) and delivered an earnings surprise of 48.61% over the last four quarters.At present, RDY has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of A.

MetLife’s 21st annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study (EBTS) reveals feeling ‘cared for’ at work is a key driver of employee holistic health and happiness, which are strongly connected to employee productivity and job loyalty. Yet the study found nearly half of today’s employees (42%) don’t feel cared for by their employers.When employees don’t feel cared for at work, their wellbeing, happiness, and overall satisfaction take a hit. They are over two-thirds less likely to be holistically healthy and happy than employees who do feel cared for. These employees are also 65% less likely to feel a sense of belonging at work and 72% less likely to feel valued by their employers. This, in turn, has a measurable impact on organizational performance: among employees who don’t feel cared for at work, only 45% are engaged, 58% are productive, and 54% are loyal (versus 87%, 90%, and 89%, respectively).""Our research shows care is not only a differentiated driver of the employee experience – but also a proven workplace metric to measure employer outcomes,"" said Todd Katz, executive vice president, Group Benefits at MetLife. ""As the economy and labor market remain volatile and workplace trends fluctuate, employers can’t afford to overlook employee care. When organizations genuinely demonstrate employee care, they are much more likely to weather macro challenges effectively, and rise to the top for current employees and job seekers alike.""Care Gaps Leave Certain Employees Feeling Less Valued, Healthy and LoyalWhile employers recognize the importance of employee care, many are failing to demonstrate it in an effective way – defaulting to a one-size-fits-all approach, rather than through an inclusive and compelling employee experience that meets individuals’ needs.Story continuesAs a result, certain employee cohorts have emerged as feeling less valued and appreciated than others – leading to clear disparities across the workforce. For example, while 72% of men and 70% of white-collar workers feel their employer is demonstrating care on the job, only 60% of women and 58% of blue-collar workers say the same. Across age groups, Gen Z employees are the least likely to feel cared for at work (only 53% do, versus 61% of millennials).Consequently, these are some of the least healthy employees in the workforce. In the last year, holistic health has declined 20% for female employees, while it has remained the same for male employees. Similarly, only 26% of Gen Z employees feel holistically healthy, compared to 48% of baby boomers. These cohorts are also less likely to think their employers are committed to their success, leading to a greater willingness to consider leaving their employers this year.Demonstrating Care at the Individual LevelAmid the fluctuating employment landscape, employers need to look at each aspect of the employee experience through the lens of care – including everything from culture, purposeful work, and flexibility, to benefits, career development and even compensation. While demonstrating care across all these touchpoints is important, the research shows each cohort prioritizes certain aspects over others – and understanding these niche needs will enable employers to optimize their approach and meet expectations. For example:Women say their employers can better show care for them with safety and comfort in the work environment, and more support from managers. To address these priorities, employers must recognize the role supportive managers play in building a strong and healthy culture, and work to better equip and empower managers to provide heightened support.With most blue-collar workers saying affordability of benefits would improve their level of perceived care on the job, employers have an opportunity to reconsider contribution levels to help alleviate employees’ financial pressures, while also enhancing their benefit communications procedures to ensure this cohort is able to truly maximize their yearly elections and meet their diverse needs.To meet Gen Z’s expectation of their employer taking action on environmental, social, and political issues, employers should use mission and value statements to better clarify what their organization stands for, its actions, and community impact.""While the concept of care is not new, our research makes clear that when it’s demonstrated genuinely, it has a profound and measurable impact in the workplace,"" said Katz. ""To really get this right, employers not only need to prioritize care, but also offer solutions that reflect the varying needs of their employees, ensuring they feel cared for as individuals.""To download MetLife’s 2023 Employee Benefit Trends Study, visit: https://www.metlife.com/ebts2023Research MethodologyMetLife’s 21st Annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study was conducted in November 2022 and consists of two distinct studies fielded by Rainmakers CSI – a global strategy, insight, and planning consultancy.

Finely balanced markets for oil, LNG, and coal are leveraged to a super-charged Chinese bounce,” WoodMac’s analysts wrote.Crude oil will be a big winner of the Chinese reopening, with prices set to increase, they noted. China has a history of over-delivering on its economic growth targets, with GDP growth outpacing government forecasts in 12 of the past 18 years, according to WoodMac. The consultancy ran two scenarios for China’s reopening – a base-case scenario with 5.5% growth and a high-growth scenario with growth at 7% this year. The high-grow scenario is far from certain, but given China’s history of under-promising and over-delivering, it cannot be easily discounted, the consultancy said.“Depending on its consumers’ appetite to spend and the ambition of government policy, China’s reopening could once again turn up the heat on prices across the energy and natural resources spectrum,” it added.Under WoodMac’s base-case scenario, Chinese oil demand would rise by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, driving the expected 2.6-million-bpd growth in global oil consumption. Barring a significant recession, WoodMac sees Brent Crude rising from current levels to average $89.40 a barrel for 2023.In a high-growth scenario, the world’s top crude oil importer could see oil demand jumping by 1.4 million bpd on the year, or about 400,000 bpd higher than in the base case, driving up oil prices by another $3-$5 per barrel compared to the base case. “As the Chinese economy reopens, commodity prices will not return to the extreme highs of 2022,” WoodMac’s analysts said.Story continues“But energy and natural resource markets remain finely balanced and commodity prices could yet surprise to the upside this year.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Xi Set To Meet With Putin In Moscow Next WeekStandard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffA North Sea Hydrogen Pipeline Network Is PossibleRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

No Credit Suisse executives or board members were on the call.UBS execs said they would move ""fast"" to wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank. The company also said it had taken reserves against Credit Suisse's high-profile litigation matters.Credit Suisse stock fell more than 52% on Monday while UBS shed around 3%.Here's what Wall Street is saying early on about the deal.Vontobel's Andreas Venditti: ""Thanks to the transaction, a collapse of CS has been avoided. This would have had massive consequences for the Swiss economy, the Swiss financial center, and UBS as well. UBS pays CHF 3 bn for a business that was valued multiples of that just a few weeks ago. In addition, it has secured important loss protections. However, there are many uncertainties and significant risks. The UBS investment case changes substantially. The issues currently impacting the global banking sector are not over.""Goldman Sachs' Lotfi Karoui: ""For credit markets, the read-through is twofold: In both the USD and EUR markets, the excess premium that investors had been demanding to hold European bank credit risk now has room to compress. On Friday, we argued that the performance of the broader European banking sector would remain pressured until clarity is provided on Credit Suisse’s future path and recommended moving to a neutral allocation on banks in the EUR market (from overweight previously). Today’s outcome provides such clarity. In particular, the liquidity and loss guarantees provided by the SNB and the Swiss government are likely to act as dampeners for tail risk and help close the recent valuation gap between European banks and non-financials. As such, we don’t think a neutral allocation is warranted and are shifting back to an overweight allocation. Of course, we are mindful that the situation among US regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from US regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist. We reiterate our overweight allocation on US money center banks in the USD market.""Story continuesA sign and logo of Credit Suisse bank is seen beneath a sign of Swiss giant banking UBS in Zurich on March 20, 2023. (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images)Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha: ""The agreement – which should achieve its goal of stabilizing CS – is strongly positive for stability and global markets relative to a no-deal scenario. But the decision to completely write down CHF 15.8bn in CS AT1 debt – which we warned last week could be at risk to enable SNB funding on the scale required – risks spreading contagion through the European banking system via repricing of bail-in debt and equity at other banks. The outcome for equity-holders may also worry investors in other weak banks, particularly but not only in Europe. If this makes it harder to raise equity capital it could have downsides for stability. The CS drama now shifts from negotiation risk to execution risk, which the Swiss authorities are moving aggressively to manage down, but is not zero. Market focus will likely broaden out to other weaker European banks as well as US regional banks.""Wedbush's Dan Ives: ""With this game of musical chairs happening on the banking sector and nervousness across the financials with the Credit Suisse fire sale to UBS announced over the weekend, we continue to strongly believe the tech trade will be viewed more as the safety trade on the Street looking ahead. So far in 2023 despite all the skeptics and many yelling fire in a crowded theater on the tech sector, NASDAQ is up roughly 13% this year with over the last few weeks more investors quickly moving to large cap tech stocks in a jittery financial backdrop with the SVB black eye moment followed by the CS arranged marriage announced this weekend.""22V Research's Jacob Funk Kirkegaard: ""Overall, my view is per my note on the ECB decision last week that European banks are well capitalized, have good liquidity (thanks ECB TLTROs) and given the design of the euro area with spreads and volatility in risk free rates will generally tend to hedge interest rate risk much more than US banks do. As such, I do not believe this is the beginning of a new European banking crisis, as at least maturity mismatches and interest rate risks are among those issues with generally a lot of focus (and hedges) and therefore relatively less risk (despite the ECB’s rapid hikes) than apparently among US regional banks. Some repricing of AT1 assets in the EU is plausible, given that investors will now be looking at whether individual banks have “similar footnotes” as CS, but given the strong response from the ECB, this will be isolated events.""BMO Capital Markets' James Fotheringham: ""U.S. investment banks are waking up to one less global competitor, as UBS management committed to down-sizing CS's trading and investment banking operations; GS, MS, JPM and others should benefit from market share development to offset otherwise-languishing global CIB revenues.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

109,e1bc7f0d-00eb-32d6-918e-06a2496cb2ec,FE,2023-03-23,Potomac Edison Files Rate Review to Help Support Continued Service Reliability,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/potomac-edison-files-rate-review-123000605.html,1679574600,STORY,['FE'],"[Residential Rates to Remain Lowest Among Maryland's Investor-Owned Regulated Electric UtilitiesWILLIAMSPORT, Md., March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Potomac Edison, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), has requested a review of its base electric rates by the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC). The proposed $44 million rate adjustment builds upon the strong service reliability enhancements made in recent years by adding additional energy grid equipment upgrades and providing ongoing tree trimming, inspections of lines, poles and substations and maintenance for newly installed equipment that enhances and modernizes the electric system.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Upon approval of the base rate adjustment, Potomac Edison customers would continue to pay the lowest electric rates among Maryland's investor-owned regulated electric distribution companies. The average Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month would see a 9.7 percent overall rate increase – or $9.50 monthly.""As the demand for electricity continues to increase with population growth in Potomac Edison's Maryland service area, continued investments in a smart, modern energy grid will help us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable electricity to homes, businesses and communities,"" said Linda Moss, president of Maryland operations. ""This rate proposal balances our need to invest while keeping electric bills affordable for our customers.""Potomac Edison has grown significantly in the last five years, now serving approximately 20,000 more customers than it did during its last base rate review. The company currently provides power to about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties. Potomac Edison also serves about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia who would be unaffected by the rate review.The rate review complies with a 2019 PSC order requiring Potomac Edison to file a new rate plan by 2023 at the end of its first Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge (EDIS). As part of this rate review, Potomac Edison is requesting a second phase of EDIS to build on the measurable success of investments made in phase one. For example, with the completion of several distribution automation projects which allow personnel to automatically switch customers to an adjacent power line during an outage, Potomac Edison has prevented about 9,300 customer interruptions and avoided 1.3 million minutes of outages that would have happened prior to automation four years ago.Story continuesThe rate review proposes completion of Potomac Edison's plan to install 68 reclosers at substations throughout the service territory to help minimize the number of customers interrupted by outages. By the end of 2023, the company will have installed 50 reclosers that allow crews to isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the remainder of the line. The remaining 18 recloser installations are proposed for completion in 2025 and 2026.In addition, the rate review supports continued proactive replacement of aging underground cable with a more reliable type of cable. Building on the 206 miles of cable replaced in the last four years, the company would replace 50 miles of cable annually until the remaining 972 miles of cable is completed.To support customers who struggle with their electric bills, the rate review also proposes the launch of two new customer assistance initiatives. One program will provide a 50% monthly discount on distribution charges to eligible low-income residential customers during the five-month winter heating period between November and March. In addition, an Energy Assistance Outreach Team will be created to increase awareness and participation in energy assistance programs available to low-income customers.Finally, the rate review seeks to recover costs associated with Potomac Edison's PSC-approved EV Driven program. EV Driven supports a state-wide goal of reaching 300,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025. To make electric vehicle adoption more accessible and convenient in Maryland, Potomac Edison has installed 35 public charging stations. Twelve more public charging sites are in the construction phase, and 12 are in the design or pre-design stages.Potomac Edison continues efforts to keep costs manageable for customers. To help customers manage their bills, Potomac Edison offers an average payment plan, special payment plans and access to energy assistance programs.

To learn more about energy efficiency products and programs to help save money, visit www.energysavemd.com.The public is invited to comment on the filing through the Maryland PSC's public comment process, and Potomac Edison will participate in public meetings about the plan and engage key stakeholders to ensure an open and thorough review of the proposal. The company expects that the new rates will be effective by October 19, 2023.Investor Note: For additional information on the filing, visit the new IR - Regulatory Corner in the ""Investor Materials"" section of the FirstEnergy website at http://investors.firstenergycorp.com.Follow Potomac Edison at www.potomacedison.com, on Twitter @PotomacEdison, and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/PotomacEdison.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

In addition to stringing the new wires, West Penn Power installed several new transmission structures along the route and made associated upgrades at the Yukon Substation, which is fed by the line. The $13.7 million project reduces the risk of overloads on the line, which could impact the reliability of the electric grid. With the new wires, the line is now able to carry increased power flow in the event of unplanned service interruptions on other lines in the area. The project was completed in December and was identified in conjunction with PJM, the electric grid operator for West Penn Power's service area, as part of its reliability planning analysis.""As the highway of the country's electrical infrastructure, a modern, robust and flexible high-voltage transmission system plays a crucial role in delivering electricity to residents and businesses,"" said Carl Bridenbaugh, FirstEnergy's vice president of Transmission. ""Working closely with PJM to identify and construct projects such as this will help enhance grid reliability for countless customers throughout the multi-state PJM region.""The project is also part of Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features.

During 2023-2025, the company expects to invest $5.9 billion in regulated distribution and $5.4 billion in regulated transmission.The company is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In 2015, FirstEnergy had set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 90% below the 2005 levels within 2045. FE aims to attain 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, with a mid-term goal of 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within the company's direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level. Also, it plans to electrify 30% of vehicle fleet by 2030 and 100% by 2050.FirstEnergy’s board of directors approved a new dividend policy that increases targeted payout ratio to 60-70% from 55-65% previously. It also expects to increase dividend rate in late 2023, subject to the board’s approval.Story continuesHeadwindsFirstEnergy has to comply with environmental regulations for its coal-fired generating plants, which may result in additional expenses. Also, any delay in completion of projects, unfavorable weather and increase in interest rates are headwinds.The company is focused on capitalizing on investment opportunities available for Regulated Transmission and Regulated Distribution segments to provide better services to customers. The success of these opportunities will depend, in part, on the successful recovery of its transmission and distribution investments. It expects a further rise in interest rates in 2023, which will increase the total project costs and decrease the desired profitability.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

(ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), is using helicopter crews to upgrade a high-voltage transmission line in Ottawa County, stringing new, larger wires that can handle additional demand if other lines in the area are out of service.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The 138-kilovolt transmission line runs nearly eight miles southwest from the Lakeview Substation in Port Clinton to the Ottawa Substation in Salem Township. In addition to stringing the new wires, ATSI will replace six existing transmission structures along the route with new steel monopoles that can better support the larger wires. ATSI also will make modifications to another 42 transmission structures, installing new components and insulators to support the wires. Insulators separate high-voltage transmission lines from their grounded support towers and help maintain safe, consistent delivery of power while preventing the current from traveling through the structures.Using helicopter crews to perform the work is faster and more efficient than deploying ground crews, which would require the creation of access roads for large trucks and equipment. ATSI began construction along the line in February and expects to complete the work in May.The transmission line serves Ottawa, Erie and Lorain counties. With the new wires, the line will be able to carry increased current in the event of unplanned service interruptions on other lines in the area. When completed, the $20 million project will enhance the reliability, resiliency, efficiency and operational flexibility of the transmission system in the area. The project was identified in conjunction with PJM, the electric grid operator for Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison's service area, as part of its reliability planning analysis.""This line upgrade will reinforce our transmission system and will help provide us with the flexibility we need to continue delivering reliable power to customers in northwest Ohio,"" said Carl Bridenbaugh, FirstEnergy's vice president of Transmission.Story continuesFirstEnergy also continues to move forward with Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features. Through 2022, FirstEnergy has invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future initiative.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Gates believes people will see AI on par with the capabilities of a human brain 10 to 100 years from now.""Compared to a computer, our brains operate at a snail’s pace: An electrical signal in the brain moves at 1/100,000th the speed of the signal in a silicon chip!"" Gates explained. ""Once developers can generalize a learning algorithm and run it at the speed of a computer — an accomplishment that could be a decade away or a century away — we’ll have an incredibly powerful AGI [artificial general intelligence]. It will be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits on the size of its memory or the speed at which it operates. This will be a profound change.""Bill Gates speaks at the Oslo Energy Forum, which is held at Oslo City Hall, Norway February 14, 2023. (NTB/Ole Berg-Rusten via REUTERS) (NTB / reuters)To be sure, Microsoft is making a huge bet today that the future will be heavily reliant on AI.In early February, Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine that runs on a beefed-up version of OpenAI's ChatGPT natural language AI technology. Last week, Microsoft said it would add ChatGPT to its 365 suite of business software which includes Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.This comes after Microsoft unveiled a $10 billion investment in OpenAI in late January.And Microsoft isn't alone in pushing the AI narrative with investors amid efforts to unlock greater tech spending among businesses and consumers.Salesforce announced Einstein GPT this month, which it says is the world's first generative AI customer relationship management (CRM) technology. Salesforce said Einstein GPT can generate personalized emails for salespeople to fire off to customers and create specific responses for key customer questions. It will also be capable of auto-generating code for developers.Story continues""With this next generation of generative AI, what it means is that AI is going to be able to do even more for you,"" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).C3.ai (AI) also unveiled a new set of tools in late January to support generative AI for enterprise applications.Gates wrote that new AI tools will go a long way to help improve learning and health care. At the same time, the tech pioneer stressed that there are risks associated with AI that governments and society at large will have to address.""There’s the possibility that AIs will run out of control,"" Gates noted. ""Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us? Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

118,359b2a56-7798-30f2-ab48-8fd6a94d046e,CRM,2023-03-23,Investors Heavily Search Salesforce Inc. (CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-salesforce-inc-130001692.html,1679317201,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +62.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +61.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.1%. This estimate has changed +51.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 indicates a change of +25% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +22.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Flowserve:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.063 = US$222m ÷ (US$4.8b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Flowserve has an ROCE of 6.3%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Machinery industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve roceIn the above chart we have measured Flowserve's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Flowserve.How Are Returns Trending?There hasn't been much to report for Flowserve's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Flowserve in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Flowserve is paying out 35% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Flowserve's ROCEIn a nutshell, Flowserve has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has declined 21% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think Flowserve has the makings of a multi-bagger.One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Flowserve (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

122,7d60c99e-d664-3476-9a6a-d104e89c66e6,SEE,2023-03-23,Sustainable Protein Packaging Starts With Trays,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainable-protein-packaging-starts-trays-133000031.html,1679319000,STORY,['SEE'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2023 / Sealed Air:Plastic taxes, regulatory bans of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam, and environmental pledges are keeping sustainability attributes such as recyclability, biodegradability, compostability, and plastic reduction top of mind for food processors and retailers. At the same time, more and more consumers are approaching the proteins case with a growing interest in products that boast eco-friendly packaging and processing.Within a complex protein category with many packaging options and formats, creating differentiation on shelf while staying convenient and cost competitive is a real challenge. As an innovator in protein packaging, Sealed Air believes there are five must-haves in a sustainable protein packaging strategy-and it starts with trays.Evaluate a Range of Sustainable MaterialsRecycled plastic content has been used in food packaging trays and bottom webs for many years, and developments such as these have inspired processors and retailers to explore even more sustainable packaging options. Solutions such as trays that do not require absorbent pads, or plant-based options are great ways to reduce the use of traditional plastic. The most progressive operations incorporate fiber or bio-based materials into their packaging, creating a potentially recyclable, biodegradable, and/or compostable pack.Don't Sacrifice Operational EfficiencyShifting to more sustainable packaging doesn't have to disrupt operational efficiency. When building a packaging strategy, you need to strike a balance between performance needs, operational and environmental impact, and cost. For example, some applications may reduce plastic or feature more renewable options, but negatively impact packaging performance and increase rework levels, or require a large capital investment. That's why it's critical to select solutions that are fit-for-use in your existing operations.Consider Consumer PreferenceRenewable packaging continues to gain momentum, driven by rising consumer perceptions for non-plastic, ""sustainable"" options or packing that uses less plastic overall. Trays that incorporate alternative materials have a higher sustainability perception among consumers than plastic trays. When rated as more sustainable, there becomes a greater likelihood that consumers will follow end-of-life recommendations to properly dispose of the trays and are happier knowing that their waste is not causing negative environmental impacts.Story continuesBuild Your BrandHigh quality design and printing on packaging helps to build brand loyalty and recognition. Trays and bottom webs have long been regarded for their branding and merchandising capabilities. Showcasing your environmental commitment on-pack is an excellent way to catch the attention of a growing number of sustainable-minded shoppers and stakeholders. This could entail messaging on packaging materials, disposal instructions, or even a QR code directing the consumer to your full sustainable packaging story.Stay Ahead of RegulationsLike many industries, regulatory headwinds play a key role in global, industry-wide shifts. In this case, a growing ban on EPS foam and plastic tax legislation is forcing some processers and retailers to rethink the future of their protein packaging. In this rapidly changing environment, failure to address EPS or find a suitable replacement early could leave you without a packaging solution, and possibly without customers.Total-Solutions ProviderYour sustainable packaging strategy should be just that-sustainable. And while there are many ways to incorporate sustainability into your packaging operations, it's critical to work with a partner that can deliver market-ready packaging solutions that prevent waste, enable circularity, and reduce climate impacts across the packaging lifecycle from sourcing and manufacturing, to design, transport, and recovery. For processors and retailers seeking clear value in sustainability solutions, Sealed Air is the total-solutions partner whose unique view across the value chain enables a comprehensive approach to advance your sustainability and business goals.Story originally published on SealedAir.com.Sealed Air, Monday, March 20, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sealed-airEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/744644/Sustainable-Protein-Packaging-Starts-With-Trays]"

This program will help medical assistant students across the United States save approximately 16% of their tuition costs (up to $2,250). The program is designed for the new students who will enroll in the RU's Medical Assisting Diploma program (12 months tenure) in April, May and July of 2023.In this context, health sciences academic program director at RU, Dr. Andy Binanti, said, “We believe our Medical Assisting Wellness Grant will make it easier for students to get started on their career journey and meet the need for medical assistants in doctors' offices, hospitals and outpatient care centers across the country.”Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for medical assistants is forecasted to grow 16% by 2031, with projected new job openings of approximately 123,000 annually. Considering this, RU’s new grant program will assist students pursuing medical assistant programs to achieve their goals and meet the expected employment needs in the country.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of APEI have declined 52.8% against the Zacks Schools industry’s growth of 18% in the past six months. Nonetheless, the stock gained 0.25% in the after-hour trading session on Mar 21, post the news release.Growth PerformanceRU segment contributed 21.4% to American Public Education’s total revenues in 2022. After the RU acquisition on Sep 1, 2021 by APEI, the segment has added an attractive portfolio of programs to the company, which is adding to the growing trend.However, the RU segment’s revenues declined to $60.7 million from $68.4 million reported a year ago. Total student enrollment also fell 9% due to a 23% collective decline in both nursing and non-nursing enrollment. This decline was due to caps on nursing student enrollment at certain campuses, reduced demand for nursing education due to record-low unemployment in some markets and fewer available nursing faculty to educate and oversee clinicals. It expects this trend to continue for 2023, particularly in this segment, owing to the impacts of inflation and higher labor costs.Although, the contributions from the RU segment in 2022 were tepid, this new grant program is expected to help pull back the enrollment numbers, resulting in top-line growth. Medical assistants are considered highly valuable professionals whose demand is expected to increase in the near future due to the advancement in healthcare and the presence of an aging population.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAPEI currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are hurting many companies in the space.Nevertheless, efforts to enhance store and digital operations along with robust brand enhancement endeavors keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Crocs, Inc., PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear.The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also offer fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks.The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs.Story continuesAdditionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies' margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies' performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience.

Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players' growth.

The pandemic boosted the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

(GES) Hurt by Cost Inflation & Currency Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guess-ges-hurt-cost-inflation-112811244.html,1679484491,STORY,"['RL', 'GES']","[Things are not looking too rosy for Guess?, Inc. GES. The company has been bearing the brunt of global cost headwinds and adverse foreign currency translations.The company’s fiscal 2023 results were affected by severe supply-chain headwinds, which led to product shortages and cost escalations. The ongoing Ukraine war has also impacted energy flows, thereby leading to elevated costs. These aspects led to global inflation, which has also been impacting consumers’ spending patterns.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has declined from $3.41 to $2.64 over the past 30 days. Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have dropped 5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%. Let’s delve deeper.Guess?, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGuess?, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Guess?, Inc. QuoteMain Impediments on Guess?’s WayOn its last earnings call, management stated that though inflationary pressure is easing, it expects increased interest rates to affect consumer spending. Also, uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine war poses threats to the global economy. Management expects consumers to remain prudent regarding their spending in fiscal 2024.Additionally, Guess? expects U.S. retailers to maintain tight inventory levels compared with the year-ago period, which is likely to impact the company’s wholesale revenues. Foreign currency headwinds are also likely to linger in fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, unfavorable foreign currency is likely to reduce revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company’s gross margin contracted to 44.2% from the 46.3% reported in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to a greater mix of markdowns relative to the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses increased to 50 basis points to 31.1%. Adjusted SG&amp;A costs escalated 4% to $254 million due to elevated store selling expenses, including labor inflation and increased selling costs to support the company’s wholesale growth.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, adjusted earnings from operations came in at $107.5 million, down 14% from the $125.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 2.6% from 13.1% due to escalated costs, reduced government subsidies, increased markdowns and currency headwinds.For fiscal 2024, Guess? anticipates the GAAP operating margin to be 8-9%, down from the 9.2% delivered in fiscal 2023. The company continues to see labor and store occupancy cost inflation, per its fourth-quarter earnings call.Beyond the first quarter, Guess? expects the middle quarters to witness modest operating profit pressure due to more prudent top-line assumptions and cost headwinds. That said, the operating margin is likely to expand in the fourth quarter, with contributions from an additional week and most of the cost pressure already absorbed.All said, management expects revenues to decrease 7-6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

127,8c72bde0-85f3-398f-b099-02e28a9288aa,RL,2023-03-23,Can V.F Corp (VFC) Get Back on Track With Its Growth Endeavors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corp-vfc-back-135401449.html,1679406841,STORY,"['VFC', 'HRB', 'DECK', 'RL']","[V.F. Corp VFC has been witnessing a tough operating environment and continued supply-chain headwinds, including higher lead times and increased volatility on the distribution and logistics front. This led to a sluggish year-over-year performance in third-quarter fiscal 2022.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 declined 17% year over year. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, adjusted earnings per share were down 10%. Net revenues of $3,531 million dipped 3% year over year due to weakness in the EMEA and APAC regions, partly offset by the solid performance in the outdoor brands, particularly The North Face. Revenues of the company’s big four brands were down 3%, while the rest of the portfolio decreased 2%.The fiscal third-quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 140 bps to 54.9% due to higher promotions. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 280 bps to 14.9% due to a lower gross margin. SG&amp;A expenses rose 5% to $1,421.6 million.Moving on, the company’s China business continues to remain dismal. Notably, fiscal third-quarter APAC revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis (up 4% at cc), whereas revenues in Greater China fell 11% (down 1% at cc). Although its raw material suppliers across China are currently operational, it saw an eight-week lockdown in China in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This led to logistics-related issues causing ongoing product delays. VFC is working with its suppliers to minimize disruptions. Currently, China has been witnessing sequential improvement as it reopens, but lower consumer spending remains concerning.Consequently, the company expects fiscal 2023 constant dollar revenue growth of 3%, down from the earlier mention of 5-6%. Vans brand revenues for the fiscal year will now be down in the high-single digits compared with the prior mentioned mid-single digits. VFC forecasts gross margin to decline 200 bps year over year compared with the prior mentioned decline of 100-150 bps. The adjusted operating margin is envisioned to be 9.5%, down from the earlier mentioned 11%. V.F. Corp expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.05-$2.15 compared with the $2.40-$2.50 stated earlier.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of VFC have lost 18.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.5%.Efforts to Counter HurdlesThat said, management is leaving no stone unturned to get back on track. It remains focused on the strategic review of its Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport brands, as well as the divestiture and leaseback of its Europe headquarters in Stabio, Switzerland. VFC is focused on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories.Also, it has been accelerating its cost-saving efforts, which are likely to generate $225 million in fiscal 2024, on an annual basis, after the completion of its previously announced actions.For fiscal 2024, revenues are anticipated to grow in the low-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. Gross and operating margins are likely to expand. Operating income is expected to grow in double digits, whereas the operating cash flow is likely to grow faster than earnings.Gains from the Supreme buyout remain a key growth driver for V.F. Corp. The company is benefitting from Supreme’s strong follower base in the younger generation, even when consumers are moving away from apparel to essential spending. The acquisition has accelerated its 2024 strategy. This strengthens the company’s long-standing partnership with Supreme. V.F. Corp collaborated with Supreme for its brands, such as The North Face, Vans and Timberland, on various occasions.Management also unveiled its five-year growth plan for fiscal 2023-2027. The company expects revenue five-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of mid- to high-single digits. The bottom line is predicted to grow, seeing a five-year CAGR of high single to low-double digits. The operating margin is envisioned to be 15% by fiscal 2027, driven by gross margin expansion and reduced SG&amp;A. Management also noted that it would return roughly $7 billion via dividends and share repurchases by fiscal 2027. Free cash flow is forecast to be $5.5 billion.Bottom LineAll said, we believe that the aforementioned initiatives will help offset supply-chain woes and other macroeconomic headwinds. Topping it, a Value Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.2% raise optimism in the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, Deckers Outdoor DECK and H&amp;R Block HRB.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are hurting many companies in the space.Nevertheless, efforts to enhance store and digital operations along with robust brand enhancement endeavors keep Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also offer fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Several companies continue to battle supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have pushed up SG&amp;A costs. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is also a major concern for the payers. A challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are seeing improved brick-and-mortar sales driven by rising consumer traffic in stores. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. Companies in the space have long been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances will likely keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic boosted the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

PG&amp;E customers also received 49% of electricity deliveries from carbon-free nuclear power generated by Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and 7% from large hydroelectric power.PG&amp;E strongly supports California's clean energy policies, renewable goals, and efforts to limit, adapt to and reverse the impacts of climate change. PG&amp;E was the first energy company to support the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which set the stage for the state's transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future. The company is planning to exceed the state's renewable and carbon-free requirements under Senate Bill 100, which requires 60% renewables by 2030 and 100% renewables and zero-carbon resources by 2045.PG&amp;E took another bold step last year, releasing its Climate Strategy Report, an action plan to meet California's aggressive carbon neutrality goals five years early in 2040, and actively remove more greenhouse gases than it emits by 2050.""PG&amp;E is proud of our clean energy leadership, and we know there is more to do. We see a path to decarbonizing our economy at the lowest societal cost and are actively supporting California's progress along this path. We're committed to accelerating the continued growth of renewable energy, unleashing the full potential of electric vehicles and battery storage, and reducing emissions across the energy economy,"" said Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, PG&amp;E Corporation.Story continuesSolar Leads PG&amp;E's Renewable Power MixLarge-scale solar energy accounts for the largest portion of PG&amp;E's total renewable energy power mix. The company has over 260 Renewables Portfolio Standard-eligible power purchase contracts, totaling over 6,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy. According to the California Independent System Operator (ISO), one MW produces roughly enough electricity to power 750 homes. PG&amp;E also owns 430 MW of eligible-renewable generation, including 277 MW of small hydroelectric, and 13 solar generation facilities located mainly in the Central Valley, which generate up to 153 MW of clean power.Additionally, PG&amp;E has connected more than 700,000 customers with rooftop solar to the electric grid, and supports customers with resources before, during and after they go solar.  Customers can find resources to help them choose a solar contractor and estimate their solar savings potential using PG&amp;E's solar calculator. One in every five solar rooftops in the country is in PG&amp;E's service area.More Battery Power to Integrate Renewable EnergyPG&amp;E continues to invest in battery energy storage on behalf of its customers. Battery storage enhances overall grid reliability, integrates renewable energy, and helps customers save energy and money. According to the ISO, currently there are times during the middle of the day when California's renewable resources can generate more electricity than customers can use. Battery energy storage allows PG&amp;E and other utilities to store excess solar or wind power for use later.The company now has contracts for battery energy storage projects totaling more than 3,000 MW of capacity being deployed throughout California through 2025. Of that, more than 1,200 MW of new battery storage capacity has already been connected to the state's electric grid including the following facilities over 100 MW all commissioned in 2022:200 MW Diablo Storage System in Contra Costa County182.5 MW PG&amp;E Elkhorn Battery in Monterey County150 MW Crimson Storage in Riverside County127 MW Lancaster Area Battery Storage in Los Angeles CountyUnleashing the Full Potential of Electric VehiclesThe transportation sector is California's largest source of GHG emissions, contributing over 40% of the state's overall emissions. Powering vehicles with electricity that is increasingly sourced from zero-emission resources like solar energy—which is plentiful during the day— is one of the most impactful measures the state can take to reduce GHG emissions and other pollutants.Nearly 500,000 electric vehicles (EV) have been sold in PG&amp;E's service area, representing one in seven EVs in the country. As part of the 2030 targets outlined in its Climate Strategy Report, the company is preparing the grid to quickly and safely power at least 3 million EVs.PG&amp;E is also working to enable as many of those EVs as possible to participate in vehicle-to-grid integration programs to support grid reliability and climate resilience. These programs include charging during periods of the day when energy costs and emissions are lower. PG&amp;E is also working to enable bidirectional charging, in which EV batteries can power a customer's home when needed or send electricity back to the grid during high demand periods when PG&amp;E would otherwise rely on natural gas-fired generation. This kind of smart charging and discharging of EVs is also a more efficient use of grid infrastructure, as it uses excess grid capacity during lower demand periods.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

The Realtor.com® February Rental Report found that despite a slight decrease in rent prices, affordability continued to get worse in 26 major metros.In February, the median rent in the 50 largest metros declined to $1,716, down $1 from last month and $48 from the peak. However, rents are still up 3.1% from one year ago, making rental payments less affordable. Renters earning the typical household income devoted 25.3% of their income to lease a typical for-rent home, up from 24.8% a year ago.""The general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't spend more than 30% of your income on housing, but the data shows that in eight of the 50 largest metros, many renters are doing just that,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Slowing rental price growth is a positive for renters, but it's important to put this in context. This means that affordability is worsening at a slower pace in many markets; it's not getting better.""The pace of rent growth has slowed for the past 13 months and experienced single-digit growth for the past seven months.

(19.0%), Cincinnati, Ohio (19.4%), and Kansas City, Mo. (19.8%).""While these American Heartland markets still offer relative affordability, they are not immune to price hikes.

Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). With the release of its February rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since February 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.Rental affordability analysis: The affordable monthly rent is calculated by applying the 30% rule to the estimated 2023 monthly median household income nationwide ($6,793 across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average) and in each metro. The monthly median household income is derived from the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas. Due to the methodology changes noted, Realtor.com has made historical revisions to its prior affordability analyses. For our most recently published affordability analysis on August 2022 data published in September 2022, the national rent-to-income share has been updated to 26.2%.  *See report for fully detailed methodologyAbout Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

Smith is a widow whose late husband was Chester Smith, a country singer, radio and TV executive.On March 17 in New York, Murdoch presented Smith with an Asscher-cut diamond solitaire ring, according to the Post. They will be married in late summer.“I was very nervous. I dreaded falling in love but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy,” Murdoch told the PostMurdoch's nuptials are unlikely to change the ownership structure of businesses in which he holds stakes, including Fox Corp, the parent company of Fox News Channel, and News Corp. Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp through a Reno, Nevada-based family trust that holds roughly a 40% stake in voting shares of each company.Fox is currently defending itself in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems.Dominion has accused the cable TV network of amplifying debunked claims that Dominion voting machines were used to rig the election against Republican Donald Trump and in favor of his rival Joe Biden, who won the election.Fox has defended its coverage, arguing claims by Trump and his lawyers were inherently newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Marathon Oil. See our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Oil?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Marathon Oil. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Marathon Oil's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Marathon Oil. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.0% and 7.2% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Marathon OilThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Marathon Oil Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$34m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Marathon Oil. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.The international financial system is yet again wavering amid the banking sector problems. Analysts are now processing the possibility of the current turmoil spreading to other banks. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos told finance ministers last week that EU banks could be vulnerable to rising interest rates. On the other hand, The European Central Bank, defying expectations, went ahead with a planned half-point increase in interest rates.  Some analysts believe the consistent rise in interest rates could hammer other European banks, creating a risk of a wider economic turmoil.Keeping a long-term investment outlook in this environment becomes extremely difficult. But if history is any guide, having a long-term perspective during stock investing is exactly what makes successful investors stand out. A BlackRock report analyzes stock returns from 1928 through 2022 to evaluate the performance of long-term investing. The report shows different scenarios on the basis of the time period of investments in the stock market. The results were extremely clear and proved that importance of staying invested in the stock market despite volatility. For example, staying invested for a 10-year period would have given you positive returns 94% of the times. On the other hand, if you just remain invested for one year, you enjoy positive returns just 75.1% of the times.The BlackRock report said:“The stock market can be volatile in the short term. It can decline substantially in a single day, creating fear amongst investors. But if you stay calm, you’ll find that the likelihood of a positive return grows higher the longer you stay invested.”“Business Pickers, Not Stock Pickers”Almost everyone emphasizes the importance of long-term investing, but few have practiced this investment philosophy better than Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett. In his latest investor letter, Warren Buffett reiterated the importance of long-term investing.Story continues“Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.”most promising stocks to buy according to analystsOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to screen for stocks whose average analyst price estimate is 50% more than their current price targets. We sorted the resultant dataset in descending order of market cap and started choosing stocks for this article from the top. We skipped highly volatile and risky stocks in the current environment, including banks, and preferred high-growth companies with actual long-term growth catalysts. We checked these companies’ one-year average price estimates on their Yahoo Finance pages and picked 15 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current levels based on these price targets.Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Analysts15. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28One-Year Average Price Estimate: $127.24Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is one of the most promising stocks according to analysts amid the Chinese company's increasing presence in entertainment, gaming and other sectors. In February, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) posted its fiscal Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at ¥263.89. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 12.5% on a YoY basis.Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings shows that 28 hedge funds were invested in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest stakeholder of Sony was Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors which owns a $124 million stake in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY).Aristotle Capital made the following comment about Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”14. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29One-Year Average Price Estimate: $31.75EV company Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is one of the most promising stocks according to analysts. Earlier this month, BofA started covering Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) with a $40 price target and a Buy rating. The price target was less than BofA’s previous price target of $50, but nonetheless represents an upside potential from the current levelsDespite some headwinds and concerns, BofA believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) remains one of the most viable EV stocks.Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Consumer Discretionary investments along with the lack of exposure to the strong performing Energy sector offset a portion of the above-mentioned gains. Within Consumer Discretionary, the underperformance of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) coupled with lower exposure to this better performing sector hampered relative results. Rivian’s shares fell as investors fretted over the company’s unit economics and how macroeconomic uncertainty is impacting the EV industry.Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an EV manufacturer producing vehicles for the consumer and corporate delivery van markets. Its shares were under pressure during the quarter. Investors remained focused on the company’s execution challenges, the implied unit economics for its vehicles, and near-term headwinds for the automotive industry stemming from a weaker global economy. Despite these headwinds, we are comfortable with Rivian’s liquidity position and its competitive position within the EV industry, which we believe will continue to grow at impressive rates. Rivian should also benefit from its positive product reviews, its integrated technology approach, and its industry partnerships.”13. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34One-Year Average Price Estimate: $215.90BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) shares were trading at around $129 as of March 17, while its one-year average price estimate stands at $215. This shows a huge upside potential for BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). Recently, the FDA announced that it has approved Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)/ BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for use as a single booster in children aged six months to 4 years who have received the regular vaccine.BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) saw a major spike in hedge fund sentiment during the fourth quarter. 34 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the company, up from 18 hedge funds in the previous quarter.Artisan Partners made the following comment about BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) is a leading biotech company focused on developing immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases. Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”12. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42One-Year Average Price Estimate: $162.01Cloud security company Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) shares fell earlier this month despite posting fiscal second quarter earnings beat. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is bullish on Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), said the company’s billings of $493.8 million during the period was not “massive” as analysts were expecting. However, the analyst believes Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)’s decline could be a buying opportunity for investors. Ives said that Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) “remains a gold standard cyber name to own and we would be buyers on weakness for this high quality zero trust growth name going through a near-term uncertain macro.""At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 42 hedge funds had stakes in Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). The biggest stakeholder of Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns an $81 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”11. Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46One-Year Average Price Estimate: $23.96Canadian oil and gas company Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) ranks 11th in our list of the most promising stocks according to analysts. Earlier this year, National Bank analyst Travis Wood upped Cenovus Energy Inc.

The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which had a $1 billion stake in the company.10. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48One-Year Average Price Estimate: $34.07Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is getting hammered recently amid recession fears. However, Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) could be a long-term play as sooner or later the economy will turn the corner. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is committed to returning about 40% of its cash flows to shareholders in 2023.In February, Benchmark analyst Subash Chandra upgraded Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) to Buy from Hold with a $32 price target after Marathon posted its Q4 results.

Upside was concentrated in e-commerce, where Coupang is now driving sequential margin expansion while maintaining a growth rate that is triple that of the industry average, lending credence to the investment case that Coupang will consolidate the fragmented e-commerce industry in Korea across both general merchandise and grocery, with healthy long-term margins to follow.”8. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52One-Year Average Price Estimate: $226.64Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) recently jumped after TD Cowen upgraded the stock to Outperform from Market Perform. Cowen’s analyst Tyler Buren said in a note to investors that expectations for Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in 2023 are “reasonable.” He estimates that Moderna, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) became a household name during the pandemic as one of the first developers of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the stock sold off sharply as COVID momentum, including high expectations for booster shots, began to wear off, causing investors to slash its fiscal 2023 earnings estimates by two-thirds over the last year. We believe those downward revisions clouded the prospects for the company’s fully funded pipeline of platform opportunities, including cancer, RSV and flu. The cash-rich company also recently expanded its partnership with Merck to improve cancer treatments.”7. Match Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MTCH) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), a long-term holding of ours offers an important illustrative example of these effects. Tinder grew reported revenues 6% year-over-year, accelerating a debate about whether this particular asset has reached a plateau in its growth curve; however, revenues grew 16% on an FX neutral basis. Has this asset stalled or is it a mid-teens grower? Other factors will determine the one true answer to this question, though FX and the stated headline make the answer seem obvious when it is not. When foreign exchange movements are modest, people tend to focus more on FX neutral assuming those changes will normalize over time, yet when movements are extreme the headline takes prominence.”6.

You can blame the general macroeconomic environment for this.Rising inflation and a hawkish Fed is not the recipe for success. However, the situation also allows the savvy investor to pick up dividend-paying growth stocks at a discount.And why not? One of the best ways to plan for volatility is to load up your portfolio with dividend-paying growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFamed investor John D. Rockefeller once said, “The only thing that gives me pleasure is to see my dividend coming in.”When it comes to dividend growth stocks, there are two ways to approach them. The first is to look at companies with a track record of hiking their annual dividend payout, like the Dividend Aristocrats.These are S&amp;P 500 stocks that have raised their dividends yearly for at least 25 consecutive years and are considered some of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street.The second way is to consider companies currently growing their dividends and top and bottom lines and view them as dividend and growth stocks.From a company perspective, giving out dividends is always great. For one thing, it tells investors the company cares and is willing to share profits. It also shows the company is thriving. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be giving out cash in the first place!Here are three names worth considering for investors seeking stocks. They offer long-term income and capital appreciation.TickerCompanyPriceMROMarathon Oil$22.01EXRExtra Space Storage$159.96EQIXEquinix$702.58Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is among the energy companies expanding through mergers and acquisitions.In November, MRO said it was purchasing Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford assets in a transaction worth $3.0 billion. This move doubles the company’s stake in the Eagle Ford basin. And purchasing these assets is expected to result in immediate earnings gains while creating future development opportunities.Story continuesThe press release highlights that the transaction said the deal is “immediately and significantly accretive” to Marathon Oil, suggesting it will significantly hike both operating cash flow and FCF.Specifically, the acquisition is projected to cause a 17% rise in the company’s operating cash flow for 2023 while also resulting in a 15% increase in free cash flow.From the dividend point of view, things cannot get better. Regarding its ranking among the top dividend growth stocks, Marathon Oil announced a rise of 11% in its quarterly payout at the end of January.CEO Lee Tillman stated in the company’s press release that this is the seventh increase to their base dividend over the past two years. According to the executive, resulting in a total increase of more than 230% since the beginning of 2021.Now, I know what you might be thinking. Does the energy giant have what it takes to cover the dividend? You need not worry on that end. Last year, Marathon generated approximately $4 billion of free cash flow, which handsomely covers its dividend. And with a payout ratio of 7.80%, there is plenty of room to grow the dividend.Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR), changing hands for under $158, is a Utah-based real estate investment trust. It holds a portfolio of over 2000 self-storage properties spread across 175 million square feet in the U.S.To improve its financial metrics, Extra Space Storage has notable expansion plans. In September 2022, for example, the REIT purchased Storage Express for $590 million. Storage Express currently oversees 106 units and eight land parcels across Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Ohio.Moreover, Extra Space Storage acquired 186 locations in 2022, including the acquisition and joint venture investment, for a total investment of $1.47 billion.In addition, Extra Space Storage is one of the top dividend growth stocks in the market. Presently, the REIT provides a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, following an 8% hike earlier this year. Its annualized payout of $6.48 per share translates into an attractive dividend yield of 4.12%.Equinix (EQIX)Image of a well-lit data centerSource: ShutterstockEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), a pure-play data center real estate investment trust, is one of the few remaining leaders in the industry after significant consolidation.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over Motorola Solutions' (NYSE:MSI) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Motorola Solutions, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$13b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Motorola Solutions has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions roceIn the above chart we have measured Motorola Solutions' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Motorola Solutions here  for free.What Can We Tell From Motorola Solutions' ROCE Trend?In terms of Motorola Solutions' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 25% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 56% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Motorola Solutions' ROCEIn short, we'd argue Motorola Solutions has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 178% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks and Motorola are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MSI has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.87, while MSI has a forward P/E of 23.70. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.99. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.63.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.27. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MSI has a P/B of 337.27.These metrics, and several others, help JNPR earn a Value grade of B, while MSI has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesJNPR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The feature enables users to turn a document of up to 25 pages into AI-generated slides with text and soon photos, competing head-to-head with Microsoft's AI ""Copilot"".

If today were six months ago, it would be more exciting. But compared to what is available today, the chatbot’s abilities are not particularly impressive.I joined the Bard waitlist and was granted access shortly after, so I tried it out.Like the basic ChatGPT product, Bard only provides general answers. When prompting the chatbot for a travel itinerary, for example, it gives general ideas of what to do with some references to real places. It is unable to provide details like events or current hotel rates, the same shortcoming as ChatGPT.When prompted for a three-day trip to London focused on modern art and Indian food, it gave three variations of suggestions for some of the most popular museums and restaurants. That could be helpful to someone early in the planning process who has never been to London, but that’s basically the extent of the capabilities at the moment.The itineraries tend to include a version of this completely unhelpful disclaimer:“This itinerary can be customized to fit your interests and budget. For example, if you are interested in art, you could spend more time visiting museums and galleries. If you are interested in food, you could visit more restaurants and try different cuisines. And if you are on a tight budget, you could eat at more affordable restaurants or cook your own meals.”The chatbot also attempts to give some travel pointers. Some are helpful, and some are obvious:Book your flights and accommodation well in advance, especially if you are traveling during peak season.Purchase a London Underground pass, which will give you unlimited travel on the London Underground for a set period of time.Get a London Pass, which will give you free admission to many of London’s top attractions.Pack comfortable shoes, as you will be doing a lot of walking.Bring an umbrella, as it can rain even in the summer.Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions against pickpockets.Enjoy your trip! London is a beautiful and vibrant city with something to offer everyone.Story continuesThe user can click a “Google it” button at the bottom of the Bard screen. All that does is perform a traditional Google search with a simplified version of the prompt originally submitted to Bard — not a helpful feature at the moment.Bard has also shown that it doesn’t have the same creative chops as ChatGPT.Google makes no claim that this is a final product — it states clearly in multiple places that Bard is an experiment. The company is in the stage of gathering user feedback to strengthen the product.Though it is tempting to compare Bard with the new version of Bing, it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison right now because Google has not updated its search engine with the generative AI tech yet. Google said that is coming in the future.Microsoft has been able to overlay its own platform and data on top of ChatGPT’s underlying tech to create a more useful end product — the new version of Bing. It is the best version of what’s available so far to consumers, and it gives users the best taste of what’s to come with travel planning and booking. The platform includes links to accompany its results, and although they’re often not helpful, that’s the right direction.While the Bing chatbot also struggles with accuracy regarding details, the links give the user more to work with. Ideally, they would be direct links for booking the specific hotels suggested, but we’ll get there. Bing does provide a link to its travel booking page, where the user can then perform a new search and book from there.In response to the prompt, “Where can I book a cool hotel room south of Midtown in New York City this weekend for under $300 per night?” Bing recommended Arlo SoHo, stating, “The price for a city king room with one king bed is $199 per night.” It was accompanied with a link to a travel article from 2021 — what’s the point of that?The actual price for an Arlo SoH room for this Saturday is over $400.All that being said, Google’s search engine is a big step behind Bing because of the lack of generative AI integration. But Bing is not so far ahead that it’ll be impossible for Google to catch up.A Question of MonetizationGoogle has said it is unsure at this point how it will monetize Bard. Google dominates the industry of ad revenue in search, so it will be important that any Google search update does not derail that profitable business.Microsoft has reportedly started discussing monetization possibilities with ad agencies for the revamped Bing search engine. The report said that Microsoft plans to allow paid links within responses to prompts.Both companies will undoubtedly insert ads into their updated search engines, but the question is exactly how they’ll fit. If too many advertisements for specific hotels or products are injected into the generative AI results without other non-advertisement options, the user could deem it unreliable.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

But while A.I. will bring some changes to the workplace, the reality may not be as dramatic, according to Microsoft co-founder and A.I. optimist Bill Gates.“There are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much,” Gates wrote in a blog post Tuesday about A.I. before adding that the ability of chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT to express ideas will “increasingly be like having a white-collar worker available to you.”Microsoft and Google have both rolled out artificial intelligence-imbued products, including their respective chatbots Bing and Bard, and this month, both companies moved to integrate A.I. with their work apps.Microsoft referred to its new features as a “copilot,” while Google said its goal is to build a new generation of “digital assistants.” And while A.I. in the workplace will likely get smarter, Gates said it may not ever become much more than a copilot.Gates, who stepped down as Microsoft’s CEO in 2000 but continues to consult for the company, touted Microsoft’s copilot features and how they will “enhance” workplaces by helping with email-writing and managing email inboxes.Eventually, as A.I.’s abilities and office implementations improve, everyone will have the equivalent of their own virtual personal assistant that would make them work more efficiently, Gates said, echoing the workplace vision for A.I. Microsoft and Google have advertised.“[A]dvances in A.I. will enable the creation of a personal agent. Think of it as a digital personal assistant: It will see your emails, know about the meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don’t want to bother with. This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do,” he wrote.A.I. was used to improve workplace efficiency long before ChatGPT hit the scene. For years companies have tapped A.I. for data analysis, automating repetitive processes, and updating old files and records. But for most of its practical history, A.I. has largely operated behind the scenes. With the technology being used in office apps, and Google and Microsoft both refining A.I.-assisted chatbots that can accomplish complex tasks in a matter of seconds, artificial intelligence is poised to become a much larger part of working life.Story continuesGates wrote that because ChatGPT has now thrust A.I. into the public eye and tech titans are dueling for dominance, advancements could continue at a breakneck pace. “[I]nnovations are going to come much faster than what we experienced after the microprocessor breakthrough,” he wrote, adding that the shift from a pre- to post-A.I. world will be as profound as the advent of personal computers.But while A.I. will change many things about how we work, including our efficiency and productivity, some growing pains will be hard to avoid. A recent study by University of Pennsylvania researchers found that while 80% of the U.S. labor force will see only 10% of their work tasks affected by A.I., as many as 19% of American workers will see over half of their job influenced and potentially jeopardized by A.I.Some leaders in the field have conceded that A.I. will likely lead to job losses, even in high-paying roles, while insisting that the jobs most likely to go will be repetitive ones that are easy to automate. “I do think clerical white-collar work is going to be able to be replaced by this,” Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, told the Financial Times last month. A decade ago, Oxford University economist Carl Benedikt Frey predicted that A.I. could wipe out 47% of U.S. jobs by the early 2030s. More recently, the World Economic Forum forecasted in 2020 that A.I. would eliminate 85 million jobs worldwide by 2025.Politicians have argued that laws to protect workers from being unemployed by A.I. and automation are needed. Some have said that a universal basic income program to keep displaced workers afloat during a transition period is necessary, while others like Sen. Bernie Sanders have proposed taxing companies that employ robots and artificial intelligence instead of humans, an idea that Gates himself floated in 2017.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Inflationary pressures have been taking a toll on markets despite a solid start to the year.Fears that the Fed would maintain its strict monetary policy and interest rate hike strategy for a longer period than initially anticipated have been reignited by strong economic statistics and hotter-than-expected inflation.Tensions escalated further in March after the U.S. financial sector was hit hard following the collapse of two banks.Earlier this month, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which mostly lends to tech firms, announced that it had to sell $1.75 billion in shares at a loss in order to cover falling customer demand. Since then, things have become worse with the bank's collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) taking over the operations of the bank.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the cryptocurrency sector, stated that it would be ceasing operations and liquidating its bank. As a result, the American government assumed authority over Signature Bank's deposits.SVB's collapse has since left bank stocks battered. Although a joint statement from the Fed, Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp assured that all depositors at these two banks would get their money back and that the U.S. financial system is stable, worries have been growing.Story continuesInvestors are now bracing for another rate hike by the Fed, which will be announced on Mar 22. Market participants are expecting a 25-basis point rate hike, which will further create pressure on stocks as more interest rate hikes are likely to be implemented in the coming months.

My name is Alex. I'll be coordinating the call today. I'll now hand you to your host Vinnie Sinisi, Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Accounting Officer to begin. Please go ahead.Vinnie Sinisi: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Gina.Virginia Drosos: Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let me begin by thanking our entire Signet team for delivering on our commitments, their dedication to our customers and their agility in the face of unrelenting challenges and change, continues to be our most enduring competitive advantage. Through fiscal '23, our company has been recognized as a great place to work certified company for three years in a row and for the fifth consecutive year, we've been honored as the only specialty retailer included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. I'm grateful to lead such a strong and diverse team. There's one clear message I want to convey today. Our Signet team delivered in fiscal year '23 and are poised to do it again in fiscal '24.Story continuesThere are three reasons for our confidence. First, Signet is uniquely positioned to grow market share because of our differentiated and broadband portfolio, industry leading connected commerce presence and ability to invest in our competitive advantages consistently and sustainably. Second, we are confident in our ability to deliver an annual double-digit non-GAAP EBIT margin based on our transformed operating model and the flexibility it creates. And third, our healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation enables us to invest in our business, while also consistently returning meaningful cash to shareholders. At this time last year, we expected the US jewelry and watch market to be down low to mid-single digits with particular pressure at lower price points, coupled with the difficult year-over-year comps.Added to that, was the volatility created by the war in Ukraine, inflationary shocks, economic turmoil in the UK and a major winter storm occurring in the peak selling period before Christmas. As a result, the category declined to the lowest end of our range. These were serious headwinds. During three of the highest revenue days of the year, winter storm Elliot caused almost one third of our stores to close or operate at reduced hours and consumers in roughly three quarters of our trade areas were under a travel advisory warning. For perspective, these days are eight times more valuable than an average shopping day in January, for example, in a way that is unique to jewelry. A critical consumer segment for our category at holiday is the late inspiration seeker who typically spends more than other consumer segments and buys gifts in person for their significant other in the last days before Christmas.Many of these shoppers delayed their purchases as long as possible this year with the storm disrupting their normal behavior at a critical time. But our team pivoted quickly in the face of all these challenges, enabling us to deliver our commitments and provide strong returns to shareholders. This is a testament to our culture of agility and innovation, the flexibility we've created in our operating model and to our financial liquidity. We've created both the culture and the capabilities to adjust as market conditions require. For fiscal '23, we estimate we again outpaced category growth and gained 40 basis points of market share driving our share to 9.7%. We delivered $7.8 billion of revenue up slightly versus fiscal '22 and an annual EBIT margin of 10.8% despite a negative 6.1% sales comp.We also executed well on our capital priorities, which are to first, invest in growth through organic investments and M&amp;A; second, optimize our capital structure and maintain a leverage ratio less than 2.75 times EBITDA and third, return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in line with our commitment to be a dividend growth company. We allocated more than $1 billion of capital in fiscal '23 to achieve these priorities. Specifically, this included $210 million of CapEx, $426 million of share repurchases, $390 million for the cash acquisition of Blue Nile and $37 million to shareholders in the form of common dividends, all while maintaining a two times leverage ratio that is well below our stated goal. Our strong liquidity position allowed for these investments and shareholder returns.Based on our confidence in our operating performance and cash flow, we are raising the dividend to $0.23 per share on a quarterly basis and are increasing our multi-year share repurchase program by $263 million for a total authorization of $775 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $2.7 billion, down 5.2% or down 9.1% comp. Blue Nile contributed to our total growth and performed ahead of sales and profit expectations in its first full quarter as part of our portfolio. It was slightly accretive to the quarter. We continue to see strength at higher price points overall and the strength of our fashion assortment continues, helping to partially offset the expected decline in bridal. Importantly, we saw some recovery post-holiday and we had one of our strongest Januarys in Signet history.As we look ahead to fiscal '24, we believe the jewelry industry will continue to be pressured by a combination of macroeconomic and industry-specific bridal dynamics. We forecast the jewelry industry to be down mid-single digits this year. Given this, we expect to deliver top line results that are flat to down low single digits and believe we are well-positioned to continue gaining market share. Despite the anticipated economic and industry headwinds, we also believe our strengthened operating model will continue to deliver annual double-digit operating margins, and we expect to maintain our approach to capital allocation, investing to widen our competitive advantages and deliver strong returns to shareholders. I want to comment briefly on bridal, which has been temporarily impacted by COVID.The jewelry industry's bridal segment is composed of two distinct parts, weddings and engagements. After a decline during COVID fiscal '23 was the year of the wedding, a 40-year high. Having anticipated this, Signet delivered strong growth in wedding bands and bridal jewelry. Meanwhile, engagements held flat during COVID at pre pandemic levels, but declined low double digits in fiscal '23 and will again decline low double digits in fiscal '24. We expect fiscal '24 to be the trough of engagements, with fiscal '25, seeing a return to growth and fiscal '26 returning to normalized levels. Supply these shifts, it's temporary and COVID driven. We have rich proprietary data on couple's behavior engagements typically occur approximately three years after couples begin dating.COVID had a meaningful impact on dating, delaying the formation of new relationships because of the lack of in-person activities for the majority of 2020. So as we begin to lap that three-year period since COVID began, we expect engagements and engagement ring sales to start recovering toward the end of fiscal '24 and continue rebounding in fiscal '25 and '26. The important point is this, bridal jewelry is a great business to be in. Absent COVID, it has been, and we believe will be again, a very steady business with roughly 2.8 million engagements and 2.2 million weddings each year. It is the financial and emotional point of market entry to our category and the opportunity to build relationships and trust that drive lifetime value. With our leadership position in this important segment, Signet is well-positioned to take full advantage of the engagement recovery as it happens both to grow sales and gain market share.In fiscal '24, we will continue to widen the mode of competitive advantages that we've built around our business in three interdependent ways. First, we're continuing to differentiate our banners with improved in-store experiences, including new store concept pilots and where appropriate, higher price point assortments. As we cast our net wider, covering more customer demographics, we have higher potential to grow market share. Second, we are continuing to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate new customer acquisition, to increase repeat purchases, to drive higher transaction values and to improve the increasing sophistication of our supply chain. Third, we're growing the value of our lifetime customer relationships by strengthening our service offerings through warranty programs, repair services, piercing services, and our new loyalty program.Let's take a closer look at each of these efforts. First, we're continuing to differentiate our banners. Given our breadth, we're able to serve accessible luxury customers, digitally native customers and value conscious customers in a scaled way that no other company in our industry can. We have clarified our banner value propositions significantly reduced overlap and created the flexibility to lean into trends to best meet changing customer's needs and economic conditions. For example, over the past several years, we've successfully teared up our product mix to drive penetration at higher price points and to move our customers up the value chain where appropriate within each banner. Signet's average transaction value is up over 30% as a result with higher price points also resulting in higher service plan attachment.In addition, in anticipation of some cyclicality in the bridal segment, we heightened focus on sentimental gifting and self-purchase occasion, resulting in fashion driving nearly 36% growth since pre-pandemic. These two strategic actions helped us to partially offset the double-digit decline in engagements in FY '23. The next way we're differentiating our banners is by optimizing our store footprint. We've aggressively closed underperforming doors over 1,000 of them over the past six years, laring in technology to enhance the connected commerce experience and leveraging data to provide highly personalized service. In fact, our sales per square foot productivity has improved nearly 50% since the beginning of our transformation. In fiscal '24, we expect to invest more than $100 million in our fleet to showcase our banner's unique differentiators.This includes expansion of new stores with proven formats in key markets, continued repositioning or closing of low performing stores, important sustainability investments like LED lighting and modern HVAC and cosmetic upgrades in key markets to bring more doors to brand standard and deliver seamless banner experiences across channels. Here are a few examples that I'm especially excited about. We will be piloting new accessible luxury Jared concepts as we continue to ship to higher price points along with additional selling features, offerings, and technology. We are accelerating diamonds direct growth, leveraging Signet scale to double our pace of store openings and give us more exposure to this highly efficient mega store model. And we are opening a number of new KAY modular concepts, which require lower inventory and build-out costs, and delivered a very attractive return in our pilot.Importantly, fiscal 24 is also a year of marketing transformation. Marketing has been a competitive advantage for Signet for some time, given our scale and ability to build national brand recognition, coupled with local marketing spend. With our new CDP coming online in fiscal '24, our marketing will become increasingly personalized. This advanced database and localized approach is important because we are seeing as much as a 40% increase in marketing efficiency when we can identify a customer in social media, present them with the right item based on what we know about their needs, and then send them directly to a nearby store to complete the transaction. Personalization is also an important theme for product in fiscal '24. Customers have a broad mindset when they think about custom jewelry.For some, it's simple like engraving or tailored sizing. For others, it's configuring a piece from a set of options with a consultant in the store or virtually. For example, KAY and Zales will have more than 25 different configurators, giving our jewelry consultants and customers the ability to mix and match, cut, quality and finish, and a fast growing segment wants to combine and modify pieces or design a custom piece entirely from scratch, even from a hand-drawn sketch that we transform into a beautiful bespoke piece of jewelry. High-touch in-store events are a great way to co-create custom jewelry and can be uniquely shaped by each banner's differentiators. We generated nearly $100 million through our pilot events in fiscal '23, and we see meaningful upside as we expand them across the portfolio.Copyright: achiartistul / 123RF Stock PhotoWe are under-indexed in important areas of product personalization, leaving us plenty of room to grow with this trend. In fact, our proprietary research indicates that this is a $700 million growth opportunity across Signet, making it an investment priority for us this year and beyond. The next way we're widening our moat is by continuing to invest in our operating model, including the scale and sophistication of our supply chain. We've been on a journey to both buy product less extensively, leveraging our scale, while also using data to improve our inventory turn and store assortments. For example, we've vertically integrated within our operations enabling us to remove layers of cost in the system, avoiding the middleman, so to speak, and offering the best value to our customers, despite inflationary and other pressures.For example, in fiscal '23, we introduced a new sourcing system, which we called The Loop. This proprietary system gives us far more visibility into component and labor costs across our banners and the ability to break apart, analyze and act on the components of product costs. In addition, machine learning and AI are driving increased efficiency in inventory costing and pricing, moving us from a sequential test and react approach to a best-in-class data-driven analytical model for both price and promotion. We're investing in these capabilities because they are already unlocking significant margin benefits. One point I want to underscore is that virtually all of the capabilities that I've referenced here and many others are fueled by the investments we've made in digital technology and data analytics.Since forming our digital organization four years ago and ramping up our transformational investments over the past two years, we've more than doubled the return on our investments. We continue to make very meaningful progress across digital. Fiscal '23 was the best Cyber Monday in Signet history with traffic up 18% and an 11% increase in demand revenue versus last year, and we're seeing improvements across nearly all our digital touchpoints. More customers are adding ESAs to their orders of 12% versus year ago in Q4. Loyalty, digital enrolment was up 2.9 times in Q4 compared to Q3. Two way SMS now represents 20% of digital sales and support contacts, growing fast as a channel of choice, and 40% of customers who engage are virtual jewelry consultants, ultimately purchase in store.In total, digital as a percent of overall sales is almost four times pre-transformation levels. Our connected commerce presence is a driving force behind our growth, maximizing the enormous potential of our team, and we will continue to invest in this strength as a critical competitive advantage. The third way we're extending our advantages is by continuing to invest in our team and our culture. We know that our team members continue to be inspired by Signet's purpose and are confident in our strategy, which drives our performance and has also helped improve retention by four points to 80% in the past year. Since the beginning of our transformation, we've seen a 15 point jump in the organization's belief in our growth strategy, and we've seen a nearly 30 point increase in our team's connection to our purpose of inspiring love.We're building on our strong engagement scores by investing in our team's growth as retail leaders through advanced learning and development. We call it brilliant university. This growth-focused training improves our customer experiences, drives execution and agility, and enables performance and career growth for every team member who participates in the program. This past year, the average Signet team member visited Brilliant University 23 times, completed nearly 10 courses and virtual classes, and consumed 12 hours of training content. Usage of our training and development offerings increased 14% last year compared to the prior year with 15% more overall course completions and a 76% increase in instructor-led training in fiscal '23 versus the year before.In total, more than 29,000 team members completed more than 650,000 hours of training and development in fiscal '23. Our team members are highly motivated to learn and excel, and we are continuing to add more offerings to develop leadership at all levels across the company. The key point is that we have achieved a cultural transformation at Signet and created an environment that is dedicated to ongoing growth, galvanized by our authentic sense of purpose. By investing in our strategic choices and capabilities, we are creating a wider mode of competitive advantages year after year, and we're able to continue fueling this growth through revenue generation and ongoing cost discipline that will deliver more than $100 million in cost savings in fiscal '24.On that note, I'll hand it over to Joan.Joan Hilson: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Our key message today is clear. In fiscal '23, we delivered on our stated commitment of a double-digit annual non-GAAP operating margin or 10.8% on a negative comp of 6.1%. We delivered a consistent inventory turn of 1.4 times, and we maintained a two times leverage ratio, even with the acquisition of Blue Nile and cash returned to shareholders. Our performance reflects our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and inventory strategy that enables us to respond to market dynamics and a gated spending practice that maximizes returns on invested capital. We are confident in our ability to deliver our commitments again this year because our strategies and our operating model are working as designed, even when faced with the challenging headwinds that we expect in fiscal '24.For the fourth quarter, we delivered total sales of $2.66 billion, a decrease of 5.2% from last year, and a down comp of 9.1%. This includes a two to three point negative impact related to severe weather on Signet's largest shopping days of the year, along with labor strikes and volatility in the UK economy. Services posted 4% revenue growth based on the success of our warranty program and service bundles, which as you'll remember, we rolled out over the summer. In addition, Blue Nile delivered sales ahead of expectations and was slightly accretive in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we expect more significant synergies over the summer of fiscal '24 as the integration is fully completed. During the quarter, bridal declined on the expected engagement headwinds while fashion had a sequential improvement throughout the quarter on strength at higher price points.Coming into the quarter, we expected that engagements would be down low double digits based on the consumer insights work that our teams have done. So we pivoted appropriately moving our assortment at the higher price points across our banners, value engineering products at the more value sensitive tiers and refining our marketing and labor approach to capture share. By leveraging the rich data we have, our team began tracking consumer behavior in time-based segments. Last minute customers, late in the year engagements and post-holiday self-purchasing. We adjusted as needed to appeal to those customers at precisely the time they needed us most. While we knew the overall trend was negative, we still expected the week between Christmas and New Years to be an important period for engagement and other shopping.We also think of that period after Christmas and New Year's January 02nd through Martin Luther King Day as the self-purchases holiday, which includes the redemption of gift cards. Our plan allowed us to partially recover from the storm by having marketing already in place during these key windows. For example, we made it easy to exchange gifts and helped customers purchase gifts for others that they weren't able to get to in time for Christmas. The net result of all of this activity was that we were able to deliver within our guidance despite the storm and post a record high January for Signet with only slightly elevated promotional activity to effectively manage our inventory position. Average transaction value in North America was up 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 11.2% for the year, reflecting both the shift in our portfolio towards accessible luxury and a tearing up of assortments within each banner where appropriate.As Gina mentioned, the anticipated decline in bridal impacted ATV in the quarter, as did a more normalized mix of banter in our portfolio. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, sales per square foot were up 35% in the quarter and 40% for the year, demonstrating the strength of our connected commerce presence, our data analytics capabilities, and our optimized fleet. Now, turning to gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was 41.6%, up 40 basis points compared to last year. This improvement reflects the expected dilution of Blue Nile, which was more than offset by a 100 basis point merchandise margin expansion in our core businesses and growth and services, Sourcing is also a margin driver as Gina mentioned earlier. We expect to capture nearly $20 million in sourcing savings in fiscal '24 reflecting the benefit of investments in our proprietary sourcing model.Core inventory was flat compared to last year, excluding acquisitions. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, inventory is down $485 million or 21% and down 8% with acquisitions. Clearance and sell down are relatively flat compared to last year and down 12% compared to pre-pandemic levels in our core banners. Non-GAAP SG&amp;A was approximately $695 million or 26% of sales leveraging slightly year over year on a high single digit negative comp and leverage 340 basis points compared to fiscal '20. This is due in part to incentive compensation, but is also a good example of the agility that is built into our operating system. We have a gated approach to spending and a flexible labor productivity model. This was effective in Q4 and throughout the year. In fiscal '23, we took $96 million of cost savings out of the operating model, in anticipation of volatile market conditions and delivered leverage on a down 6.1% comp.This strategy is intentional. We are fueling investment in critical areas as we continue to strengthen our competitive advantages. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income of $405 million was slightly down from $411 million last year, and is a 15.2% margin, a 60 basis point improvement from last year. Non-GAAP operating income excluded $35.2 million in charges related to asset impairments and non-recurring litigation, as well as acquisition and integration charges related to Blue Nile. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.52 is up from $5.01 in Q4 of fiscal '22. For the year, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $11.80 was down from $12.28 in fiscal '22. Turning to the balance sheet, we had another positive year with $659 million of free cash flow, resulting in $1.2 billion in cash on hand and $2.6 billion in overall liquidity at year end.Further, we were able to maintain a strong DPO due to continued terms management. Our debt leverage ratio of two times EBITDAR is down nearly half from pre-pandemic levels and well below our stated goal of 2.75 times. Looking forward, we expect capital investments of up to $200 million for fiscal '24. Roughly half will go to investments in our fleet, with the balance being invested in digital and technology investments as well as other critical capabilities. We will focus on marketing transformation and personalized communication, next-gen automation and demand planning in our supply chain and digital features that drive e-commerce conversion. There's one important point that I want to make regarding capital allocation. Our strong cash position and disciplined capital management enables us to generate free cash flow that funds critical investments even during a slower economy.This ensures that we'll have the capability we need to win with customers and to grow share as economic conditions improve. This is a meaningful advantage. We've created a cash generation engine that enables us to invest when others cannot. We will continue to invest and return cash to shareholders despite challenging market and economic conditions. I'll turn to guidance shortly, but first I want to talk about the ongoing potential we see in our services business. Services are a big piece of the jewelry ownership cycle and a key driver of lifetime value. Service customers are 78% more likely to return for a repeat purchase and repeat service customers have a three times higher spend than other customers. Every additional 1% of repeat services customers is worth $100 million in incremental revenue to Signet.We've made meaningful progress in this business growing revenue by roughly $150 million over the past three years. We are building awareness of our services offerings by mobilizing and training our store teams, amplifying marketing, and by bringing even sharper insights through data analytics into the role that services play in our customer's jewelry ownership experience. For instance, we've really come to understand how much anxiety some people have when they place a piece of jewelry that they treasure into the hands of someone else for repair. We've acted on that understanding by making that process much more transparent. With online customer repair trackers, for example, customer usage of this tracker has increased by 29 times since we expanded it across all banners, and we know that repair customers checked the tracker three times on average during the course of a repair, all of which are further opportunities to connect and communicate.We're also working with strategic partners on tracking technology innovation to increase transportation visibility throughout our network. In addition, we know that our warranty program, our largest services business, provides peace of mind for engagement rings, wedding bands, and other sentimental pieces that customers think of as their forever jewelry. We are communicating peace of mind as a key benefit of repair along with the quality of a repair itself. Another example is our Vault Rewards loyalty program. Loyalty members generate 55% higher average transaction rates than non-members, but that's not their only value. They are also enabling our personalization efforts. The Vault Rewards program enables us to identify and get to know our customers with increasing precision, who they are, how they like to shop with us, where we exceed their expectations, and where we have opportunity.We've launched Vault Rewards in Jared, KAY and Zales and already have roughly two million members. We expect to reach approximately four million vault rewards members by the end of fiscal '24 as we realize the full year effect of the KAY and Zales programs. In total, we expect the enhancements we're making across services will generate more than $100 million in incremental revenue this fiscal year, putting us on track to build services into a billion dollar business within two years, and to continue growing in a range of mid to high single digits. Now, let me discuss our full year guidance for fiscal '24. Guidance reflects top line performance that we believe will outpace the market while also delivering an annual double digit operating margin.We expect the US jewelry industry to be down mid-single digits in fiscal '24. As Gina mentioned earlier, we expect headwinds to continue in engagements with recovery beginning later this year. In addition, with the slowing economy and continued inflationary pressures, we do not expect to see a rebound in the lower price point consumer and will continue to manage our assortment and marketing accordingly. With this in mind, we expect full year revenue in the range of $7.67 billion to $7.84 billion and non-GAAP EBIT of $765 million to $800 million or 10.2% on the high end. This assumes over $100 million in cost savings, the completion of the Blue Nile integration in the third quarter, provision for incentive compensation back to normalized levels and benefits from investments and improved capabilities.We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $11.07 to $11.59, which includes share repurchase activity through March 15. As a reminder, our EPS guidance does not include the impact of further share repurchase activity, tax discrete items, and any changes in current tax laws. It also includes the dilutive effect of the 8.1 million preferred shares. Now, turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion and non-GAAP EBIT of $97 million to $108 million or 6.5% on the high end. This includes the shift in Mother's Day from the first quarter into the second quarter, which we estimate to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million of revenue. This also includes the continuation of the engagement trends we saw in Q4.Recall we're lapping first quarter top line growth of 8.9% last year, which was the highest quarterly performance in fiscal '23, and included the remaining impact of stimulus spending in the first part of the quarter last year. Our Q1 gross margin will face a drag of roughly 100 basis points of de-leverage related to rent expense with a similar level of impact on SG&amp;A from investment spending and our digitally native banners. Our digitally native banners, James Allen and Blue Nile will remain a margin headwind until Q3 when we expect meaningful accretion from this business. The underlying point here is that we believe we are poised to continue growing market share and cementing our competitive advantages because our strategies and operating model are working precisely as we've designed them to do.We're delivering consistently in a range of environments because we're able to leverage our capabilities and flexibility to adjust as market conditions require. I want to thank our Signet team for delivering on our commitments despite a highly challenging environment. I'm very proud to work by their side. With that, we're happy to take your questions.See also 12 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2023 and 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

154,65da0a67-133e-3ea9-a23a-773d3444aa75,WBA,2023-03-23,Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-expected-140002551.html,1679407202.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reports results for the quarter ended February 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -30.8%.Revenues are expected to be $33.45 billion, down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?For Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Walgreens will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.16, delivering a surprise of +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walgreens appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WBA is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 28, before market open.In the fiscal first quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.9%. WBA’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.72%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens is likely to have gained from continued strategic executions on both the United States and the international front. The quarter’s top line is likely to have benefited from the opening of its ninth automated micro fulfillment center, now supporting about 3,000 total stores, which is expected to offer pharmacists more time for services and outreach that drive adherence and improve patient health. The top line is likely to have benefited from the Walgreens Health business, which brings equitable, personalized, whole-person healthcare to local communities across America.The addition of Summit Health is renhancing Walgreens’ portfolio of leading assets across the care continuum, boosting synergy opportunities and accelerating profitability. We believe this to have likely benefited the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Walgreens sold 19.2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock in November and December 2022, with total after-tax cash proceeds of $3 billion. The company also sold stakes of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals in December for nearly $150 million. The proceeds will be used primarily for debt paydown and the funding of the company’s strategic priorities. This strategic selloffs are likely to have reduced revenues in the company’s fiscal second-quarter while improving its debt position.United StatesWalgreens is likely to have registered growth in U.S. retail pharmacy business as the COVID headwind lessens and initiatives to drive script volume gain traction through the months of the fiscal second quarter. During the fiscal first quarter, the company’s flu vaccinations were up from the prior year’s levels due to higher flu incidences. Season to date, the company administered over 9 million flu shots. This, too, should have contributed to the top line in the fiscal second quarter.Story continuesIn the United States, Walgreens’ retail business continued to witness impressive momentum through digital and omnichannel growth from the myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and other profit streams. During the fiscal first quarter, the company expanded U.S. retail margins while managing supply chain costs, maintaining price positioning compared to competitors, and stabilizing shrink levels. These developments are likely to have contributed to Walgreens’ fiscal second-quarter revenues.InternationalIn the last reported quarter, the international business registered an ongoing rebound and strong execution across its retail portfolio, particularly in Boots U.K. and growth in the German wholesale business. The company is expected to have registered strong growth in the fiscal second quarter, banking on a strong Christmas season with robust comp sales growth.In the fiscal fourth quarter, sales increased 4.6% year over year, reflecting growth across all international markets, with Boots UK advancing 4% and Germany wholesale growing 4.2%. Walgreens noted that the integration of the wholesale business in Germany remained on track, with operational synergy gains coming ahead of schedule. This development is expected to have accelerated international businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.Walgreens HealthThe Walgreens Health segment is likely to have gained from its majority investments in Shields Health and VillageMD. In the fiscal first quarter, VillageMD delivered 49% on a pro forma basis, with growth driven by existing clinic growth and expansion of the clinic footprint. Shields delivered pro forma sales growth of 44%, driven by recent contract wins, further expansion of existing partnerships and strong executio focus. VillageMD and Shields are expected to have driven pro-forma sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by recent contract wins and by expanding their value proposition with existing health system partners.EstimatesFor second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $33.67 billion indicates a 3.3% dip from the prior-year comparable quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.12, suggesting a 16.67% growth year on year.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Walgreens this time around.

(WBA) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-walgreens-boots-alliance-130001428.html,1679317201.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -10.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 14.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share, indicating a change of -30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 points to a change of -10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walgreens.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.51 billion and $139.9 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

159,b8f9ce6c-a4a9-35bc-8519-f12db194c6af,PAYX,2023-03-23,Paychex (PAYX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-payx-earnings-expected-grow-140002515.html,1679493602,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Paychex (PAYX) reports results for the quarter ended February 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.36 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paychex?For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paychex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.99, delivering a surprise of +4.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Cap Gemini SA and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now.

We also note that CGEMY has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.44.Another notable valuation metric for CGEMY is its P/B ratio of 3.10. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.34.Based on these metrics and many more, CGEMY holds a Value grade of B, while PAYX has a Value grade of D.Story continuesCGEMY stands above PAYX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CGEMY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

161,61d66c91-d835-39c2-ab25-bc3241f2db73,PAYX,2023-03-23,Gen Zers are now ‘polyworking’ because holding down just one job doesn’t pay enough or give them the flexibility they want,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-now-polyworking-because-130347397.html,1679317427,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Traditionally, people would find a vocation they enjoyed (and that paid a decent wage) and steadily climb the ranks, dedicating their career progression to one employer.But as the cost of living has increased, wages stagnated and people took to working longer (making it harder for younger workers to progress into senior roles), professionals today aren’t waiting for their boss to promote them.Instead, they’re taking matters into their own hands: After years of job hopping and, more recently, the explosion of side hustles, workers now are splitting their time across numerous employers—at once.The phenomenon of working two or more jobs, called polyworking, came about as people seized the opportunity to take on multiple full-time roles while they were working from home.Without a tiresome commute, getting from one job to another is as easy as signing into your computer for your second shift of the day—and it’s why, according to new research, a third of workers are holding down three or more jobs.Who is most likely to be juggling jobs?Paychex surveyed over 1,000 American workers to find out who is most likely to be juggling multiple jobs, and the impact it’s having on workers.They found that while 40% of workers overall currently have multiple jobs, this number rises to almost half of Gen Zers.And not only are the youngest generation of workers the most likely to be holding down multiple jobs—they’re also even more likely to be splitting their time between three or more employers; a full 47% hold down three or more jobs, according to Paychex.Meanwhile, 33% of millennials are holding down three or more jobs, compared to 28% of baby boomers and 23% of Gen X professionals.Freelance and remote workers were the most likely to report being employed at multiple firms.Plus, some industries are more conducive to polyworking than others: Computer and technology sector workers are most likely to have multiple income streams. These workers are likely to also take on extra work in other fields, mostly within the health care industry. Meanwhile, the researchers also found an overlap with finance workers taking on extra shifts in the retail and education sectors.Story continuesWhat’s more, they don’t plan on giving up their second or third jobs any time soon.Around half of the respondents said they plan to polywork indefinitely—and the older respondents were, the more likely they were to see juggling jobs as a long-term solution as opposed to a means to an end.Their motivation varies, according to the research: “Without multiple income streams, Gen Xers and millennials most fear the possibility of having to move to a new home,” the report claims. “While baby boomers are particularly worried about their inability to keep up with inflation.”Overall, flexibility, additional income, and freedom were the biggest benefits cited among polyworkers.So to entice young workers—the generation most likely to be guilty of polyworking—into committing to one firm, the report suggests employers “consider offering them financial security, flexibility and be open to contract work, while emphasizing your company’s commitment to authenticity and diversity.”Polyworking is taking its toll on workersAlthough more financial freedom and the chance to have multiple creative outlets should spell increased happiness for polyworkers, the research shows that’s not necessarily the case.The researchers compared those working multiple jobs with one-job workers and found that polyworkers are more likely to feel burned out, stressed, and uninspired. Although they’re slightly more satisfied with their work-life balance, polyworkers are also significantly less productive and report that they’d feel healthier in another role.And whether or not you’re one of the 40% of workers who are polyworking, the toll of the trend undoubtedly impacts you.The same portion of your colleagues or staff could be working in this new way—and they’re likely to be less dedicated to their job. Meanwhile, the ripple effect on the wider workforce if 40% of their peers are unproductive or unhappy shouldn’t be overlooked.The 200 managers who were surveyed also reported that polyworkers don’t stick around as long, are slower at learning and developing skills, demonstrate poor organization, and are difficult to integrate into the company culture.As a result, they concluded that polyworkers are more difficult to manage than those with a more traditional setup.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

""We must care for"" customer-facing staff, he wrote.""We strive to be a different kind of company operating in a different kind of world,"" he said, adding Starbucks plans to ""reinvigorate"" its employee culture.His comments came the day after Starbucks workers walked off the job at 100 stores around the United States, and a video posted by the union on social media showed hundreds of activists marching in protest outside company headquarters.The former PepsiCo and Reckitt Benckiser executive, who joined the company in October, took over on Monday as Howard Schultz stepped down from his third stint as CEO of the chain he helped turn into a global coffee behemoth.Narasimhan must contend with the company's divisive record on labor unions, an issue of increasing concern to politicians and shareholders.The company has said it complies with U.S. labor law. It has accused the union of failing to bargain in good faith and the National Labor Relations Board of running unfair elections that favored the union.Schultz is scheduled to testify next week before a U.S. Senate committee on the topic.Investors voted Thursday on a shareholder proposal for an independent review of Starbucks' practices on union organizing and collective bargaining.The company did not disclose results of the voting.During the meeting, acting executive vice president and general counsel Zabrina Jenkins addressed the proposal, saying the company is conducting an independent assessment ""that will include a deeper level review of the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. This represents a much broader commitment than the shareholder proposal requests.""Story continuesJonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at shareholder Trillium Asset Management, one of the investors that made the proposal, said this was the first time he had heard that argument.Jenkins' comments ""didn't provide clarity"" and were ""very vague,"" Kron said.But Narasimhan taking over ""is a real opportunity for a pivot"" on unions, he said.Much of the meeting consisted of a video showing Narsimhan's last six months with the company, visiting coffee farmers, suppliers and cafes around the world, donning a green apron and giving fist bumps and high fives to baristas.LABOR STRIFESince late 2021, workers at more than 290 U.S. corporate-owned locations have voted to unionize. Unionized employees say the company illegally retaliated against union organizers with firings and store closures.Hundreds of pro-union baristas and supporters protested outside Starbucks' Seattle headquarters on Wednesday, according to Starbucks Workers United and video on social media.Chanting and carrying signs reading ""seize the beans of production"" and ""be kind to your workers,"" baristas urged the company to increase staffing and schedule the workers for more hours so they could qualify for health insurance benefits.""Stop union busting and show up to the bargaining table,"" barista Hailey Cribbs from Bellingham, Washington, told the rally.(Reporting by Hilary Russ; additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and David Gregorio)]"

Narasimhan joined Starbucks October 1 as interim CEO with plans to officially begin his role and join the Starbucks' Board of Directors on April 1, 2023, making his CEO transition two weeks earlier than initially planned.Four days into his role as the official CEO and ahead of the company's annual meeting of the shareholders, Narasimhan sent a letter to its employees (or what Starbucks calls partners).In the letter, he emphasized his focus on ""long-term sustainable growth,"" which includes finding ways to elevate the brand, build on Starbuck's ""leadership position,"" strengthen customers' digital experience, and grow the brand's global presence.He also noted that he plans to focus on employees. ""Critically, we will reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks,"" he said.This comes after more than 100 stores went on strike Wednesday to ""demand basic rights"" and ""welcome"" Laxman whom they say has an ""opportunity"" to stop ""union busting,"" per the labor union Starbucks Workers United.Narasimhan also said in the letter that he plans to ""continue working in stores for a half day each month, to keep us close to the culture and our customers.""So, who is Laxman Narasimhan?Known as ""Laks"" to baristas, the 55-year-old business executive was born in 1967 in the town Pune, India, where went on to earn a degree in engineering. He then earned a Master's degree in international studies and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania. He reportedly speaks six languages; German, English, Spanish, and three Indian dialects.Story continuesNarasimhan began his career at the consulting firm McKinsey, becoming a senior partner.

As noted earlier, his tenure also kicks off as the company continues to tussle with unionization efforts by employees who don't believe they are being given a seat at the table.Though no longer CEO, former CEO Howard Schultz is scheduled to testify before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee on Wednesday, March 29, in response to accusations that Starbucks has not allowed its workers to ""organize unions,"" nor engaged ""in collective bargaining to improve their wages and working conditions,"" according to a statement from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.Other items on Narasimhan's agenda include implementing the company's accelerated growth strategy, what it calls the Reinvention Plan, expansion into China and curbside delivery there, and the rollout of the olive-oil infused coffee line Oleato, among others.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Sheila Talton, sold US$191k worth of shares at a price of US$77.24 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$75.20. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Sheila Talton was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Sysco Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Sysco. In total, Independent Director Sheila Talton dumped US$191k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Sysco Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.2% of Sysco shares, worth about US$65m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sysco Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Sysco is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We're in no rush to buy! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Sysco you should be aware of, and 1 of these is a bit unpleasant.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:XEL) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-inc-nasdaq-xel-191644436.html,1679512604,STORY,['XEL'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xcel Energy is:10% = US$1.7b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.Does Xcel Energy Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Xcel Energy has a superior ROE than the average (8.4%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Xcel Energy.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Xcel Energy's Debt And Its 10% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Xcel Energy, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.49. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Xcel Energy may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Archer-Daniels-Midland. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Archer-Daniels-Midland does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 8.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm are the second and third largest shareholders.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$266m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Archer-Daniels-Midland. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

176,f2e8ef7e-a63d-3158-8d3c-ec66c44d7c4b,ADM,2023-03-23,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-archer-daniels-130001028.html,1679403601,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. The Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, to which ADM belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of -10% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 points to a change of -14.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.26 indicates a change of -7.1% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $99.88 billion and $100.7 billion estimates indicate -1.9% and +0.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $26.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was +17.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

179,27ffd66d-76d9-36d0-902d-07d4348de18c,SNPS,2023-03-23,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Synopsys a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123012458.html,1679315412,STORY,['SNPS'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Synopsys (SNPS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SNPS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Synopsys' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Synopsys' main business drivers.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. The company offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. It also sells physical synthesis and physical design products as well as physical verification products.The company’s products are used to design a chip, from concept to the point of delivery to the manufacturer for fabrication. Synopsis provides software and hardware, which are used to develop electronic systems that incorporate chips. Additionally, the company provides Intellectual Property (IP) used in semiconductor design and manufacturing to simplify the design process and accelerate time-to-market for its customers.Synopsis reports revenues in three segments, namely Time-Based Products, Upfront Products and Maintenance and Service.Time-Based Products (59% of fiscal 2022 revenues): Segment revenues are recognized as Technology Subscription License (TSL) revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from fees over the period of the license or as and when the installments are paid by the customer, whichever is later.Upfront Products (24%): These revenues are recognized as Term License revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from term licenses in full after the completion of the shipment of the software, wherein at least 75% of the license fee is paid within a year of shipment, after fulfilling all other revenue recognition criteria.Maintenance and Service (17%): Under this segment revenues come from maintenance fees that are generated over the maintenance period; along with revenues generated from professional service and training fees.The company conducts its business across four geographic regions namely: North America (47% of fiscal 2022 revenues), China (16%), Europe (10%), Korea (10%) and others (17%).Synopsys’ competitors include EDA vendors like Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Synopsys a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $10,565.23, or a 956.52% gain, as of March 20, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 150.95% and the price of gold went up 18.28% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for SNPS.Synopsys is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys’ Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line. Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new compute and machine learning architectures. Our estimates suggest that Synopsys’ revenues will grow at a CAGR of 9.8% through 2023-2025. However, tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates might hurt the company’s near-term growth prospect. Geopolitical challenges and restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.10%, and there have been 8 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Philip Morris International, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 36%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.5% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Philip Morris International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Philip Morris International.The Trend Of ROCEWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Philip Morris International. The company has consistently earned 36% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 27% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Philip Morris International has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 44%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Our Take On Philip Morris International's ROCEIn short, we'd argue Philip Morris International has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 27% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.If you want to continue researching Philip Morris International, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.98%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 7.48%.Coming into today, shares of the seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands had lost 5.42% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 1.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.95%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Philip Morris as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 20, 2023. On that day, Philip Morris is projected to report earnings of $1.31 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 16.03%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.04 billion, up 3.77% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.29 per share and revenue of $34.76 billion, which would represent changes of +5.18% and +9.45%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Philip Morris. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.93% lower within the past month. Philip Morris is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Philip Morris is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.32. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.57, so we one might conclude that Philip Morris is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, PM's PEG ratio is currently 3.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Tobacco stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.67 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Tobacco industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, which puts it in the bottom 14% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.You can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Philip Morris (PM) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.32 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 20, 2023.PM has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.76%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.32 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31.PM is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. General Mills (GIS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.General Mills, which is readying to report earnings on March 23, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.94 a share, and GIS is two days out from its next earnings report.For General Mills, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91 is 3.07%.Story continuesPM and GIS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The portfolio gained 1.3% net of fees and expenses in 2022 compared to a -18% return for the MSCI World Index. The portfolio compounded at 12.3% annually net of fees and expenses, since inception. In addition, check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Broyhill Asset Management highlighted stocks like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco company. On March 17, 2023, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock closed at $94.79 per share. One-month return of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was -6.90%, and its shares gained 0.69% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a market capitalization of $147.877 billion.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.""Story continuesaddiction, background, bad, brown, cancer, cigar, cigarette, closeup, concept, dry, empty, filter, flavor, habit, harmful, isolated, lifestyle, machine, narcotic, nicotine, over, paper, pile, pleasure, product, relax, relaxation, roll, roller, rolling, smoke, smoker, stress, tobacco, tube, whiteCopyright: nedoba / 123RF Stock PhotoPhilip Morris International Inc.

ORCL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Amid Market UncertaintyWall Street has been trying to recover after taking a beating earlier this month as concerns over interest rate hikes continue to dent investors' confidence. Inflationary pressures have been taking a toll on markets despite a solid start to the year.Fears that the Fed would maintain its strict monetary policy and interest rate hike strategy for a longer period than initially anticipated have been reignited by strong economic statistics and hotter-than-expected inflation.Tensions escalated further in March after the U.S. financial sector was hit hard following the collapse of two banks.Earlier this month, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which mostly lends to tech firms, announced that it had to sell $1.75 billion in shares at a loss in order to cover falling customer demand. Since then, things have become worse with the bank's collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) taking over the operations of the bank.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the cryptocurrency sector, stated that it would be ceasing operations and liquidating its bank. As a result, the American government assumed authority over Signature Bank's deposits.SVB's collapse has since left bank stocks battered. Although a joint statement from the Fed, Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp assured that all depositors at these two banks would get their money back and that the U.S. financial system is stable, worries have been growing.Story continuesInvestors are now bracing for another rate hike by the Fed, which will be announced on Mar 22. Market participants are expecting a 25-basis point rate hike, which will further create pressure on stocks as more interest rate hikes are likely to be implemented in the coming months. The Fed's fight to tame rising inflation is far from over.Given this situation, an astute investor would choose to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks at this time.

Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland's second-largest bank after UBS, had been approaching the brink of collapse despite receiving an emergency credit line from the Swiss National Bank last week.ODDO BHF downgraded UBS to Underperform from Neutral, noting ""very limited due diligence"" around the merger deal and the impact the integration of Credit Suisse's operations will have on its growth initiatives.KBW downgraded the bank to Underperform from Market Perform, noting, in particular the suspension of UBS' share buybacks, which it believes was a key part of the investment thesis in the company. They warned as well that the Swiss government's decision to write off $17B in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one debt will ""unsettle"" some investors.Meanwhile, BofA Securities upgraded UBS to Buy from Neutral.UBS shares are currently trading more than 7% lower on the Swiss Stock Exchange, while Credit Suisse plunged another 60% this morning after experiencing heavy selling last week.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news first.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Digital Currency and Payments Stocks to Buy Now. One aspect of our daily lives that has completely transformed over the past decade or so is payments. The advent of the smartphone and the rise of the internet has brought everyone's bank account right at their fingertips and created new digital wallets where money is stored on the Internet. This enables everyday users to use their smartphones to pay for a wide variety of goods and services and increases the convenience offered to them in their daily lives.This growth in digital payments isn't only a characteristic of the developed world. In fact, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic spurred growth in the digital payments market as it accelerated a shift to online platforms. This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed.Today, we'll look at some top digital payments stocks, with the notable picks being PayPal Holdings, Inc.

196,bb13aea3-05cf-3a8a-8207-6df0c8ebc686,WU,2023-03-23,Index Launch: Remittances Play a Powerful Role in Consumers’ Financial Planning,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/index-launch-remittances-play-powerful-124500926.html,1679489100,STORY,['WU'],"[Inaugural Global Money Transfer Index surveys 30,600 consumers in 20 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia PacificIndex voices consumers’ international money transfer preferences for today and tomorrow as they navigate global headwindsDUBAI, United Arab Emirates &amp; SINGAPORE &amp; CASABLANCA, Morocco, March 22, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As global populations navigate macroeconomic headwinds, consumers expect remittances to play an even stronger role in their current and future financial planning. According to Western Union’s inaugural Global Money Transfer Index launched today, 64% of money transfer consumers send and/or receive money once a month or more. Over the next 12 months, 75% expect these remittances to increase.The Global Money Transfer Index asks consumers how, when and why they use international money transfer capabilities today, as well as their expectations for tomorrow. Surveying 30,600 consumers in 20 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, it is the largest consumer research published by a money transfer operator. The results bolster Western Union’s ‘Evolve 25’ strategy to combine high-value, accessible retail and digital financial services for all.The Index shows that economic challenges such as higher global cost of living mean 79% of receiving consumers must ask for more money. For the same reason, 71% of senders agree they are transferring more than previously. This may contribute to why consumers state frequency and volume of remittances are primarily influenced by family requirements, despite common perception that remittances are driven by when salaries are received.While family support is identified as the main purpose for remitting, consumers say transfers also play a strong role in future financial planning. Paying for education costs ranks second highest as a reason consumers remit money. Supporting business interests at home and saving for the future are cited by consumers as critical reasons too.Story continues""We all felt a strong sense of relief as global economies went into post-pandemic recovery,"" said Jean Claude Farah, President of Middle East and Asia Pacific at Western Union. ""However, macroeconomic conditions have since made the daily lives of people more challenging. Remittances are typically resilient because of their purpose. This makes it even more incumbent on money transfer providers to stay agile, supporting consumers on their journey. That is why today we have launched the Global Money Transfer Index – to share the voice of the consumer, how they view money movement today and, come tomorrow, what they will need.""Maximizing opportunity during times of instabilityTogether with cost-of-living, consumers demonstrate that they keep a sharp eye on how their local currency performs back home. In a bid to maximise on opportunity, 68% send more money when the currency value falls in their receiving country. Sixty-seven percent of receivers agree that when currency values fall, they receive more money.Currency fluctuations are front-of-mind for consumers. When asked about the future, 79% want money transfer brands to offer an additional service notifying them when relevant currency values begin to shift so they can plan transfers accordingly. Achieving better service and greater value also reflects in how consumers determine which money transfer brands to use. Criteria such as achieving the best exchange rate, ensuring lowest or no charges paid by receivers and speed of transfers sit in the top three.Digital today, choice tomorrow.Industry research shows that there are over five billion internet users in the world today, growing at an annual rate of 1.9%. This growth rate is even higher in developing economies.1 In sync with this, the Index highlights that over half of consumers (56%) want to use digital-only solutions for their money movement needs.However, three billion people remain unconnected, so there is much more to do to achieve true digital equity. Of those who choose not to use digital transfer services at all, trust and customer experience are identified as top barriers—along with a preference to seek face-to-face interaction - among both senders and receivers.When consumers look to the future, however, the picture changes. A much greater proportion (52%) want a choice in platforms when transferring or collecting. Bridging the digital with in-person experiences will significantly broaden the consumer financial ecosystem.""Combining digital and physical experiences is the power behind Western Union’s strategy,"" says Mohamed Touhami El Ouazzani, Head of Africa at Western Union. ""If we want to maximise financial inclusion, we must offer consumers diverse options when moving money. This is vital if we want to create long-lasting relationships with consumers and make meaningful impact in communities.""Innovation sits high on consumers' agenda.Consumer preferences will continue to spur innovation within the financial services industry. When asked how they would like remittances to evolve, the focus is on advances that will enable even greater convenience, better planning and inclusivity.Senders and receivers are frustrated with repetitive and time-consuming paperwork (72%). In fact, 79% would prefer facial recognition/biometric technology for instant and reliable registration. Receivers also want their funds to be disbursed on a prepaid card or e-wallet that does not require a bank account (76%), as well as the option of receiving in different currencies (83%). Eighty-one percent are eager for integrated ‘super’ apps, allowing them to manage remittances alongside other financial products with ease.""The progress of innovations within financial services has been astonishing,"" Farah says. ""Whether in countries such as the Philippines, Australia, the UAE, Singapore or Saudi Arabia, central bank investments have created a vast array of safe and reliable choices for consumers. We all have a role to play in ensuring consumers are able to look after themselves, their families and their future with confidence and ease. By sharing what we have learnt in the Global Money Transfer Index and working in continuous collaboration with the financial services industry, we believe we can meet and serve people wherever they need us to be.""About Western UnionThe Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) is committed to helping people around the world who aspire to build financial futures for themselves, their loved ones and their communities.

Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations.In 2022, it signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio. Also, it has a significant number of leases lined up. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the retailer sales per square foot touched another record high of $753 for malls and outlets combined.As of Dec 31, 2022, the occupancy for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio came in at 94.9%, up from the 93.4% witnessed as of Dec 31, 2021. The base minimum rent per square foot for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio was $55.13 as of Dec 31, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Dec 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of 2.3%.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited 2022 with $7.8 billion of liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 4.8, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.Recently, SPG closed a new $5-billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the existing $4-billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, the company is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have risen 21.0% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 9.3%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has marginally moved down to $12.04 over the past week.With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for SPG. Online retailing is likely to remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Further, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for Simon Property. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate.The company has a substantial debt burden, and its share of total debt as of Dec 31, 2022 was approximately $31.5 billion. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses stands at $884.5 million, implying a rise of 16.2% year over year. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been revised 0.8% upward over the past month to $6.45.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty’s 2023 FFO per share has been revised a cent upward over the past month to $1.64.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced the release of its annual Impact Report that reflects on the past year and highlights HCA Healthcare’s positive impact across the communities it serves.""I am proud to share the remarkable work of our physicians, nurses and colleagues in our annual Impact Report,"" said Sam Hazen, chief executive officer of HCA Healthcare. ""From discovering new and innovative ways that improve patient care to supporting communities through giving and volunteering, our colleagues’ commitment to showing up each and every day for others never wavered.""The HCA Healthcare Impact Report highlights significant efforts of the organization in advancing patient care, supporting its colleagues and investing in its communities. For additional details on these areas, please visit HCAhealthcareImpact.com to learn more.Delivering high-quality patient careHCA Healthcare was responsible for more than 37 million patient encounters in 2022. The organization uses these interactions to develop and share best practices across its enterprise to help continuously improve patient care. HCA Healthcare has been recognized nationally by leading benchmarking institutions for its dedication to patient safety and quality. In the fall 2022, more than 80% of HCA Healthcare hospitals rated by The Leapfrog Group received an ""A"" or ""B"" Leapfrog Safety Grade. This is higher than the national average of 57%.In December 2022, HCA Healthcare announced its enterprise-wide adopted Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) program, a patient-centered, researched-based, multidisciplinary approach to surgical recovery that allows patients to play an active role in managing their own care and recovery plan.

The HCA Healthcare Research Institute (HRI) is the multispecialty clinical research arm of the organization, focused on unlocking insights into real-world data and conducting clinical studies that lead to breakthroughs in science, medicine and care for all. In 2022, HRI had 27 sites nationwide and conducted more than 250 trials.HCA Healthcare is committed to fostering a foundation of inclusion, compassion and respect for its patients and colleagues and to ensuring equitable access to high-quality care. Last year, the company established a Patient Advisory Group (PAG) to identify patient needs and drive progress toward HCA Healthcare’s patient care goals, including identifying and addressing opportunities to reduce health disparities and improve care. The organization also announced a number of initiatives to address key healthcare issues, including strategic collaborations with Johnson &amp; Johnson and the American Heart Association, and continued its work with March of Dimes.In 2022, HCA Healthcare provided the delivery of charity care, uninsured discounts and other uncompensated care at an estimated cost of approximately $3.5 billion.Supporting clinicians and colleaguesHCA Healthcare recognizes that actively seeking feedback from physicians and implementing change based on input is vital to maintaining high quality care.

PPG benefits from cost savings due to restructuring activities, pricing actions and synergies of strategic acquisitions.  The company also remains committed to maximizing shareholder returns. However, it faces headwinds from input and logistics cost inflation due to supply disruptions. Weak demand in Europe and China, unfavorable currency and a soft U.S. housing market are other concerns.The company shares are down 4% over the past year compared with a 7.2% decline of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.What’s Favoring PPG?The company is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end-use markets with weak business conditions. The company's incremental restructuring savings in 2022 were $65 million, which included lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of sales. It anticipates $12 million in incremental restructuring savings in the first quarter of 2023. PPG also reduced its working capital requirements in the fourth quarter by decreasing inventory levels sequentially.PPG Industries is on track to raise selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of rising raw material costs. The company intends to completely recover the cost inflation experienced since 2021, with continued price hikes beginning in 2023. This is likely to strengthen its margins in 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Buyouts, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also aims to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases.Story continuesA Few ConcernsPPG is being challenged by elevated costs for raw materials and logistics.  Raw material and logistics cost inflation on a year-over-year basis is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2023. In the foreseeable future, labor availability and elevated logistics costs will likely persist. The company's profitability is likely to be hurt by higher costs.The continued geopolitical issues in Europe (stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict) and the impacts of pandemic-related restrictions in China affected demand in the fourth quarter. Demand weakness is expected to continue in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2023, hurting sales volumes.Unfavorable currency translation is a challenge for PPG Industries, as seen in the fourth quarter, as it has an adverse impact on sales across all of its segments. The fourth quarter saw a $120 million decline in sales for the Performance Coatings business due to unfavorable currency movement brought on by the U.S. dollar's sharp increase against a number of other currencies, particularly the euro. Currency headwinds are expected to continue in the first quarter of 2023.PPG is also expected to face challenges due to the weakening U.S. housing industry, as demonstrated by declining housing trends in recent months. In the near future, it is anticipated that the softening housing market in the United States will negatively impact the company's DIY business. The company is likely to continue to face demand headwinds in 2023 due to a slowdown in single- and multifamily home building.PPG Industries, Inc. Price and ConsensusPPG Industries, Inc.

PPG recently launched PPG Envirocron Primeron primer powder portfolio, which is designed to protect metal substrates like steel, hot-dip galvanized steel, metalized steel and aluminum from high corrosion.The company stated that protective primers are the first line of defense that shields metal surfaces against corrosion, which is a significant challenge faced in the metal coatings industry.

However, the company will prioritize supporting customers by providing superior service and products, optimizing inventory levels and executing several cost savings initiatives. It also expects a rebound in demand for its technology-advantaged aerospace products, moderate raw material costs and stable coatings demand in Europe from the second quarter. It also anticipates a strong economic recovery in China to boost earnings.PPG projects adjusted EPS in the band of $1.10-$1.20 for the first quarter, barring amortization expense of 13 cents and costs related to previously approved and communicated business of 2 cents.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.63%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 6.65%.Coming into today, shares of the investment bank had lost 12.14% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 6.77%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%.Goldman Sachs will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 18, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Goldman Sachs to post earnings of $8.75 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 18.68%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.28 billion, up 2.69% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $33.14 per share and revenue of $50.37 billion.

Central banks’ efforts to rein in inflation by boosting interest rates are the right course of action, Hammack said, but rising rates “create more instability” in markets and in the corporate outlook.“So you need to be extra vigilant around liquidity and capital and risk management when you’re in that environment,” she said.Goldman Sachs is expanding its global financing business within investment banking as the New York-based lender aims to make its revenue more “durable, recurring and stable,” she said. Net revenue for fixed-income, currency and commodities financing increased 47% in 2022, to $2.79 billion, reflecting higher revenue from secured lending, according to the bank’s earnings statements.Brazil is contributing to the expansion, said Hammack, who spoke last week in an interview at the bank’s office in Sao Paulo. “My visit here is a critical part of supporting our business in Latin America, which has been on just a tremendous growth trajectory over the past several years,” she said.Story continuesGoldman stepped in with loans as Latin American startups faced shrinking public valuations that made equity sales less attractive. Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings Ltd., known as Nubank, and digital retailer MercadoLibre Inc. were among those that received financing from Goldman last year.Sovereigns, quasi sovereigns and top corporate names still can access global capital markets, where borrowing costs are lower than Brazil’s domestic bond market, said Cristina Estrada, co-head of the firm’s investment-banking division in Brazil. “We’re advising our clients to be flexible and opportunistic to find the right market windows, because we do think those windows will present themselves.”Americanas BankruptcyGoldman hasn’t been immune to troubles in Latin America. The firm holds 1.065 billion reais ($203 million) in credits to distressed retailer Americanas SA due to swaps transactions with the Brazilian firm, according to Americanas’s creditors list. The retailer stopped paying creditors after filing for bankruptcy protection in January.Hammack declined to comment about Americanas specifically, but said “we feel very good about our credit-underwriting practices, and anytime there’s an issue anywhere in the world, we always go through many reviews to understand what went right, what went wrong, were there signals that could have been seen?”Estrada said Goldman’s “appetite to help our clients in derivatives throughout the region hasn’t changed.”Hammack, the former global treasurer for Goldman and the former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, also visited Brazil to promote diversity. As a member of the global inclusion and diversity committee, she and Estrada hosted a dinner for about 10 senior women in region, including company founders, CEOs and chief financial officers.“It’s always great to get senior women leaders together because there’s an empathy and a connection that you find with like-minded folks who’ve gone through similar challenges,” she said. “It just helps to build friendships, but you can also build business partnerships based on that connectivity.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpTrump’s Tariffs Couldn’t Save the California Olive IndustryPumping Heat a Mile Underground Is Helping One City Cut CarbonFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhonesA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight Trains©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Digital Currency and Payments Stocks to Buy Now. One aspect of our daily lives that has completely transformed over the past decade or so is payments. The advent of the smartphone and the rise of the internet has brought everyone's bank account right at their fingertips and created new digital wallets where money is stored on the Internet. This enables everyday users to use their smartphones to pay for a wide variety of goods and services and increases the convenience offered to them in their daily lives.This growth in digital payments isn't only a characteristic of the developed world. In fact, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic spurred growth in the digital payments market as it accelerated a shift to online platforms. This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.96bUS$5.11bUS$5.82bUS$6.22bUS$7.02bUS$7.56bUS$8.02bUS$8.40bUS$8.74bUS$9.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x13Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 7.71%Est @ 6.02%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$3.6kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$103bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$103b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$36bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$75b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$47.4, the company appears about fair value at a 9.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.502. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SchlumbergerStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Schlumberger (SLB) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 21, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.62 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.60 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Schlumberger has an Earnings ESP of 3.12%.SLB is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Liberty Oilfield Services is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 19, 2023. LBRT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.89 a share 28 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Liberty Oilfield Services is $0.82, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 9.13%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SLB and LBRT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt Is Leggett &amp; Platt Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$360.0mUS$338.0mUS$349.0mUS$377.0mUS$397.0mUS$412.7mUS$426.7mUS$439.4mUS$451.4mUS$462.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.95%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$326US$277US$259US$254US$242US$228US$213US$199US$185US$172(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.4bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$463m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$5.7bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.7b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$2.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.4b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$30.6, the company appears about fair value at a 8.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Leggett &amp; Platt as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.407. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Leggett &amp; PlattStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Packaging Corporation of America's current trading price of US$131 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Packaging Corporation of America’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America What Is Packaging Corporation of America Worth?Good news, investors! Packaging Corporation of America is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $202.42, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that Packaging Corporation of America’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Packaging Corporation of America generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -15%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although PKG is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to PKG, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PKG for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The company’s cost-management and process-optimization efforts are also driving growth.Let’s look at some factors that make PKG a stock to be retained in portfolios.Stock Outperforms IndustryShares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 7.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $9.14 per share, whereas the same for 2024 is pegged at $9.05. The consensus estimate for 2023 and 2024 has moved north by 3% and 2%, respectively, in the past 30 days.Earnings Surprise HistoryPKG has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 6.2%.Upbeat OutlookPackaging Corp projects first-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.23 per share. The company expects its Packaging segment to deliver a higher total volume, with corrugated plants having four additional shipping days. Prices will fall as a result of the recent reductions in published domestic containerboard prices. The company anticipates lower export prices as well.In the Paper segment, Packaging Corp expects prices to move slightly higher, with fairly flat sales volume.Factors at PlayPackaging Corp is gaining from solid growth in e-commerce activities that has led to an increase in demand for packaging. Packaging products are essential for distributing food, beverage and pharmaceutical products. The Packaging segment, which accounts for 91% of the company’s revenues, will continue to be supported by stable packaging demand for meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, medicine, and other consumer products.The company is executing outstanding cost-management and process-optimization efforts at its mills and corrugated product plants. It expects its Packaging segment to deliver a higher total volume in the first quarter of 2023, with corrugated plants having four additional shipping days. Despite the weak demand, Packaging Corp continues to perform above the pre-COVID levels. It expects shipments in the first quarter to be 6% higher than first-quarter 2019 shipments on a per-day basis.Story continuesAcquisitions to Aid GrowthAs part of its recent strategic action, Packaging Corp acquired all assets of Advanced Packaging Corporation in December 2021. The deal supports Packaging Corp’s focus on enhancing its containerboard portfolio through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. The buyout will boost the company’s mill capacity and box plant operations.Moreover, the company completed debt refinancing in October 2021, which extended its overall debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years and lowered its overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%.Near-Term ConcernsPackaging Corp is facing inflationary pressures, high-interest rates and persisting supply-chain disruptions due to unfavorable global and domestic economic conditions. As customers are working to lower their high inventory levels, it has impacted the order flow and demand for Packaging Corp’s products.Labor costs and certain indirect costs are expected to remain elevated due to the temporary idling of some containerboard mill operations in the fourth quarter. In addition, labor and benefits costs, and other timing-related expenses were higher in 2022. Inflated prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda, also remain a headwind, which will be somewhat offset by lower wood and recycled fiber prices, energy prices, and reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses. High interest and non-operating pension expenses, and a higher tax rate are also expected to hurt margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are OI Glass OI, Tenaris TS and Illinois Tool Works ITW.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) share price is 112% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Aptiv While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, Aptiv failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 20% (annualized).This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.It may well be that Aptiv revenue growth rate of 9.6% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthAptiv is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Aptiv returned a loss of 8.6% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 12%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 6% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Aptiv (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesWe will like Aptiv better if we see some big insider buys.

There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Hologic Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.08bUS$989.8mUS$1.14bUS$1.08bUS$1.20bUS$1.25bUS$1.29bUS$1.33bUS$1.37bUS$1.41bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.22%Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.12%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$1.0kUS$854US$913US$802US$829US$803US$772US$740US$707US$673(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.1bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = US$26bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$26b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$12bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$78.6, the company appears about fair value at a 5.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hologic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.940. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HologicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance buoys optimism. However, forex woes and Nutrition Product recall are impeding growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 15.9% compared with a 37.9% decline of the industry and a 11.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $170.89 billion. The company projects 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 22.42%.Let’s delve deeper.Q4 Upsides: Abbott exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide Diagnostics sales grew over 11% in the fourth quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where, excluding COVID-19 tests, sales improved 30% year over year. Within EPD, sales increased 8% organically in the fourth quarter, led by double-digit growth. In Medical Device, sales rose 7.5% globally. In the United States, sales growth was led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. Within Diabetes Care specifically, fourth-quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre grew over 40% in the United States and global Libre sales reached $4.3 billion for 2022.Core Diagnostics Grow Strong: In Diagnostics, COVID testing sales were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide diagnostics grew over 11% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where, excluding COVID-19 tests, sales improved 30% year over year. During the pandemic, Abbott significantly expanded the install base of ID NOW and opened new testing channels. This expanded footprint drove strong growth and supported testing needs when flu and other respiratory infections surged late in 2021. During 2022, Abbott continued with the rollout of Alinity, the company’s innovative suite of diagnostic instruments, and expand test menus across its platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProgress With Diabetes Business: This business achieved organic sales growth of 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022 led by strong growth in FreeStyle Libre.

Further, Health Canada has also approved additional kill claims on non-porous surfaces for viruses that may cause African Swine Fever and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea.The latest development is likely to fortify Neogen’s Animal Safety business.More on Neogen Viroxide SuperNeogen Viroxide Super is a peroxygen-based powder disinfectant that provides quick, broad-spectrum disinfection when used as part of a wide-ranging biosecurity program. Neogen Viroxide Super can disinfect animal housing and equipment, boot baths, vehicles, and other hard, non-porous surfaces.Neogen Viroxide Super's active constituents are potassium peroxymonosulfate and sodium chloride, which have been verified effective against multiple industry-relevant bacteria and viruses. The product is effective in hard water, and its preparation is simplified by a color change to green, indicating ready to use.Benefits of Latest ClaimsThe label claims stipulate that Neogen Viroxide Super can kill the virus on hard non-porous surfaces, which is the main source of Avian Influenza A, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS), and African Swine Fever.These additional virucidal claims further fortify the trustworthiness and reliability of the Neogen Viroxide Super disinfectant within production animal marketplaces, particularly with the ongoing Avian Influenza outbreaks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer management, those working in production animal facilities, as well as in companion animal spaces, horticulture, and aquaculture environments, will be able to prevent the spread of disease and keep the people and animals they care for safe and healthy.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the animal disinfectants market size is projected to reach $4.6 billion by 2027 from $3.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 7.6%. Increasing focus on the expanding facilities, marketing schemes and information exchange programs to create awareness and enhance the use of animal disinfectants is projected to contribute to growth of the market.Story continuesProgress in Animal SafetyThe latest development aligns with Neogen’s growing efforts toward fortifying its Animal Safety product portfolio.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Animal Safety revenues were up 8.4% year over year, consisting of 6.9% core growth, 2.4% from acquisitions and a foreign currency headwind of 0.9%. The core growth was led by the company’s portfolio of biosecurity products, driven largely by share gains in the animal protein market, sales of dairy hygiene products, and new insect control products. The company’s line of parasiticides, acquired in September 2021, and veterinary instruments both reported an increase in market share gains.The company’s genomics business also performed well, with global core growth of 7.9%, led by volume increases in the U.S. beef market, partially offset by declines in testing in China caused by COVID-related lab closures.Per management, the acquisitions of GVS and CAPInnoVet are part of Neogen’s strategy to expand companion animal offerings. The company’s acquisition of Delf UK Limited is expected to bolster its performance dairy chemicals offerings. Delf’s industrial cleaning products complement Neogen’s Quat-Chem disinfectant and cleaner offerings, enhancing its biosecurity portfolio.Share PriceIn the past six months, Neogen has outperformed its industry.

The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its focus on patient monitoring are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on Masimo SET and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 14.9% against the industry’s 12.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 11.3% fall.The renowned global provider of non-invasive monitoring systems has a market capitalization of $9.29 billion.

Masimo has delivered an earnings surprise of 9% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q4 Results: Masimo’s solid fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust uptick in the top line, its healthcare business and order shipments during the reported period. The expansion of the company’s installed base was also seen. Masimo has also been deriving benefits from its acquisition of Sound United, owner of iconic brands such as Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Denon and Marantz, raising our optimism.Product Pipeline: We are upbeat about Masimo’s product pipeline, where a slew of products is expected to be launched this year.

Thus, the company’s business is highly dependent on the continued success and market acceptance of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Masimo SET platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems and from companies currently marketing their pulse oximetry monitors.Estimate TrendMasimo has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 8.9% north to $4.75.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $557.3 million, suggesting an 83.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $551.4 million, suggesting an 81.3% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The company witnessed solid top-line and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources.

But some have grown skeptical as the project’s details cast doubt on the environmental benefits of revamping the 127-year-old complex on 1,100 acres in Rodeo, California.The company’s initial claim that it would slash greenhouse gasses by half doesn’t match the project’s environmental impact report, published by county regulators, which shows a 1% reduction, according to a Reuters calculation of emissions data in the report. What’s more, refining of petroleum byproducts may continue as a side project.And renewable-diesel production will require a surge in marine and train traffic, increasing emissions and spill risk. The conversion also requires boosting natural-gas usage to produce hydrogen required to make the biofuel.These dynamics and other variables raise questions about Phillips 66’s marketing of renewable diesel as a green fuel and make it impossible to tell whether and how much the refinery overhaul will reduce community pollution, three independent environmental experts told Reuters.The project’s environmental impact will be a test case for similar facilities worldwide. Several dozen new U.S. renewable diesel plants are planned, according to energy consultancy Stratas Advisors. Most will be conversions of oil refineries. Production capacity could triple, to 6 billion gallons, by 2026, Stratas says. Europe and Asia are seeing similar trends.The Rodeo conversion could be either “a model or a cautionary tale,” said Gwen Ottinger, an associate professor in the Center for Science, Technology and Society at Drexel University who has studied air-pollution monitoring in Rodeo.Story continuesPhillips 66 representatives say the project, dubbed Rodeo Renewed, will significantly cut certain regulated pollutants and will lead to large cuts in greenhouse gasses when the biofuel is burned in vehicles. The refinery’s general manager, Jolie Rhinehart, said renewable diesel is the cleanest-burning option for use in transporting goods by truck.“Heavy-haul trucking is a vital aspect to our way of life in this country and in this world,” she said. “And renewable diesel is the lowest-emission way to fuel that energy that we need to keep our trucks moving.”Rhinehart added that emissions directly from the plant, affecting local residents, would be “significantly reduced” by the project.Some Rodeo residents worry the overhaul could become another chapter in a long story of local pollution. Sitting across the bay from San Francisco’s glittering cityscape, Rodeo is a poster child for post-industrial problems. In addition to the Phillips 66 plant, the area has hosted a second oil refinery, a lead smelter and a dynamite factory. Vacant storefronts and rusted-out cars blight the boulevard leading to a beach too toxic for swimming. The community, in unincorporated Contra Costa County, has much higher concentrations of illness, poverty and brownfield cleanup sites than most others in California.“It could have been the jewel of the county,” resident Janet Callaghan said of Rodeo. But over the years, industrial pollution has “turned Rodeo into the armpit of Contra Costa.”Maureen Brennan, a member of Rodeo’s air-monitoring committee, called the biofuels project an experiment with uncertain environmental benefits. After initially cheering the plan, she said: “I started to realize that we’re actually the global guinea pigs here.”CONFLICTING POLLUTION ESTIMATESRenewable diesel is made from feedstocks such as soybean oil, beef tallow or used cooking oil. It can be used in heavy-duty trucks with no engine modifications. The Phillips 66 plant may also produce other biofuels.The county board of supervisors in May approved the project, which is expected to start operations in early 2024.Phillips 66 spokesperson Bernardo Fallas said the difference in the company and county greenhouse-gas estimates stems mostly from the fact that county regulators included pollution projections for five fossil-fuel refinery processing units for which the company intends to keep operating permits. The company excluded those units, which Fallas said would not be operating when the biofuels project starts. Phillips 66, he said, has not yet decided whether and how the fossil-fuels units would operate in the future.Fallas confirmed, however, that Phillip 66 is considering a plan to process slurry oil, a heavy residual crude oil byproduct, using the refinery’s coker. Fallas said the slurry-oil processing would produce materials needed for electric-vehicle batteries.The county said in a statement that slurry-oil processing “would not be consistent” with the refinery revamp it approved in May, and would require additional regulatory review.The county’s environmental impact report estimated greenhouse gasses by assuming emissions from the coker and the four other units would remain unchanged, an approach the study called conservative. It also included emissions from the expected increase in natural-gas use and from projected increases in transportation to the plant.The claim has also made its way into filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including an annual proxy statement and a handful of 8-K disclosures.The company’s disclosures to the SEC, however, dropped the 50% claim after the draft environmental impact report was published in October 2021. The company said it updated its messaging to “ensure consistency” with the report.While Phillips 66 and the county made strikingly different projections of the biofuels plant’s greenhouse-gas pollution, they agreed that the project would have a climate benefit extending beyond the facility’s local emissions. They said biofuels produce less greenhouse gasses than traditional gasoline or diesel when burned in vehicles. That reduces emissions over the total “lifecycle” of the fuel, which includes all aspects of exploration, production and consumption. Considering only local pollution from the plant, the county said, underestimates the potential greenhouse-gas emissions reductions by “orders of magnitude.”Some researchers, however, contest that claim. They argue that carbon emissions from clearing and tilling land to farm biofuels feedstocks, such as corn or soybeans, offset any reductions in tailpipe emissions.TRUCKS, TRAINS REPLACE A PIPELINEPhillips 66 projects the conversion will reduce emissions of certain federally regulated air pollutants, such as benzene, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Sulfur oxide emissions are expected to drop 80% from 2019 levels and larger particulate matter pollution by 20%, Fallas said, citing the environmental impact report.Three independent environmental experts said it’s likely some of those emissions - along with those of greenhouse gasses - will fall simply because of a reduction in overall capacity after the transformation. As an oil refinery, the plant processed nearly 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude – far more than the projected capacity of 80,000 bpd of biofuels feedstocks.The plant’s emissions after conversion are difficult to predict, the environmental experts said, because of the lack of research on pollution from large-scale renewable-diesel processing and because the company has not publicly outlined what feedstocks it will use. The Phillips 66 operation could result in reductions of some pollutants, when compared to oil refining, but increases in others, said Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University and director of the school's Atmosphere/Energy Program.“I expect to see no improvement whatsoever,” Jacobson said.“You'll just get a different set of chemicals coming out of the (biofuels) refineries compared with the traditional refineries of diesel and gasoline.”In addition, the surge in transportation related to biofuels processing could worsen local pollution, said Ron Sahu, an independent air emissions consultant.Phillips 66 plans to shut a 200-mile oil pipeline to the plant, leading to a doubling of tanker vessels and a tripling of rail-car arrivals, according to the environmental impact report. Truck traffic will fall overall but sharply rise to part of the refining complex closest to the most densely populated part of Rodeo, bringing residents there in contact with more particulate-matter and other transportation pollution.The project will also cause a projected 29% increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the plant that will be using more natural gas to produce hydrogen for biofuel processing, according to the report.Janet Pygeorge, 87, lives in view of the refinery’s smokestacks. She remembers a 1994 chemical leak at the refinery, then under different ownership, that sickened tens of thousands of people. A Phillips 66 predecessor company bought the refinery in 2001. Since then, the plant has had seven “major accidents,” including fires and toxic releases, through 2018, according to the latest available county data.That history makes the prospect of continuing fossil-fuel operations unsettling to residents who lived through it, Pygeorge said. ""It just doesn't sound safe to me.”(Reporting by Laila Kearney; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Phillips 66 is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.7b ÷ (US$76b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Phillips 66 has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Oil and Gas industry average it falls behind. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Phillips 66 compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Phillips 66.What Can We Tell From Phillips 66's ROCE Trend?We like the trends that we're seeing from Phillips 66. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 16%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 37%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.In Conclusion...To sum it up, Phillips 66 has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has only returned 21% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Phillips 66 (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:TJX) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$76.36. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's stake.Insiders in TJX Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that TJX Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$136m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At TJX Companies Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of TJX Companies, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

247,a213e740-b5e3-3b63-bea5-8ad7adba775e,AMGN,2023-03-23,Those who invested in Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) five years ago are up 59%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-140030735.html,1679493630,STORY,['AMGN'],"[While Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 12% in the last quarter. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. Unfortunately its return of 37% is below the market return of 68%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Amgen While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 35% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 59%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.6% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 10% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Amgen  that you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

248,2b9006ac-b503-3e31-8125-c6f0be1023d7,AMGN,2023-03-23,Here's What is Driving Amgen (AMGN) Stock's Outperformance,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-driving-amgen-amgn-stocks-095109992.html,1679478669,STORY,"['AMGN', 'AZN']","[Amgen AMGN is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets.Thousand Oaks, CA-based Amgen also has a promising pipeline of cancer drugs. It has one of the strongest cash positions in the biotech sector, which could be used to acquire more pipeline assets that could fuel long-term growth. Biosimilar drugs are also a key part of Amgen’s growth strategy.Though the stock has lost 0.6% this year so far, it has outperformed the decline of 14.3% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Amgen’s key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Otezla are aiding sales, driven by volume growth. These drugs are gaining consistent approvals for label expansions.Moreover, Amgen is evaluating Prolia/Xgeva, Vectibix, Enbrel, Aranesp, Kyprolis, Nplate and Blincyto for additional indications. A recent key new drug approval was Tezspire/tezepelumab to treat severe asthma in the United States in December 2021. Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. AstraZeneca announced that Tezspire was approved in Japan and Europe in September 2022. AMGN and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after payment by the latter of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to the former. While AstraZeneca leads development, Amgen leads manufacturing.Another new drug, Lumakras (sotorasib) was approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United States in May 2021 and the EU in January 2022. It is now launched in more than 45 countries. Though sales of this key new drug have been slower than anticipated, Amgen’s label expansion studies on Lumakras in earlier lines of therapy, which have the potential to significantly expand the currently addressable patient population, are progressing rapidly.Amgen also boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio, which is an important long-term growth driver. It markets Kanjinti (a biosimilar of Roche’s Herceptin) and Mvasi (a biosimilar of Roche’s Avastin) in the United States and Amgevita (a biosimilar of AbbVie’s [ABBV] Humira), Kanjinti and Mvasi outside the United States. In the United States, AbbVie’s Humira biosimilar, Amjevita was launched in January 2023. With a five-month lead over the next biosimilar entrant, Amgen expects a rapid uptake of the biosimilar in 2023.Story continuesBiosimilars of J&amp;J’s Stelara (ABP 654), Alexion’s Soliris (ABP 959) and Regeneron’s Eylea (ABP 938) are in late-stage development.Though sales of Amgen’s present biosimilars, Kanjinti and Mvasi, are falling due to lower prices and volume declines due to increased competition, biosimilar revenues are expected to return to growth with the launch of Amjevita (Humira biosimilar) in 2023 and the next wave of launches of biosimilar versions of Stelara, Eylea and Soliris.The company has six more biosimilar launches planned for global markets by the end of 2030, which should drive long-term growth.Amgen has been quite active on the M&amp;A front lately. In 2022, it bought ChemoCentryx, which added a newly launched innovative rare disease drug, Tavneos, to its portfolio.In December, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics HZNP for $116.5 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will add several first-in-class early-in-lifecycle biologic drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio. The Horizon Therapeutics acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2023.Amgen has its share of problems. Increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products, including some biosimilars. The Humira U.S. sales erosion in 2023 and increasing biosimilar competition for some other legacy products create potential revenue headwinds. The softness in sales of Enbrel, one of Amgen’s largest products, is also a key cause for concern. Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of the firm’s revenues.Amgen’s net selling price has declined for the past few years, with the trend expected to continue in 2023 due to increased competition. Amgen expects a mid-single-digit price decline in 2023. In addition, foreign exchange headwinds with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates, persistently high inflation, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment.Nonetheless, continued strong growth of key drugs like Repatha, Prolia and Evenity and contribution from newer drugs Tezspire and Tavneos, higher sales from ex-U.S. markets, increased contribution from its high-quality biosimilars and costs savings should keep the stock afloat in 2023.Zacks RankAmgen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.65%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 6.65%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the gold and copper miner had gained 3.17% over the past month. This has outpaced the Basic Materials sector's loss of 2.51% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.3% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Newmont Corporation as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Newmont Corporation is projected to report earnings of $0.28 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 59.42%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.85 billion, down 5.57% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.24 per share and revenue of $11.87 billion. These totals would mark changes of +21.08% and -0.42%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Newmont Corporation should also be noted by investors.

The precious metal touched $2,000 an ounce on Monday amid a wobbly banking sector, elevated inflation, and expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike (or none at all) at the next Fed meeting.“When things get scary out there, investors run to safe havens, and gold is basically one of those major safe havens,” Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Inthemoneystocks.com and verifiedinvesting.com.Gold futures (GC=F) are up 6% since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the closure of Signature Bank of New York spurred concerns of a banking contagion.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has lost 6.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -59.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -51.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.1%. This estimate has changed -8.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.64 indicates a change of +17.8% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Newmont, the consensus sales estimate of $2.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.6%. The $11.87 billion and $12.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.4% and +1.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $3.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $0.44 for the same period compares with $0.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.57%. The EPS surprise was -6.38%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

257,1786810a-a580-3663-a85b-1bb0be07b0d6,NEM,2023-03-23,3 Low-PE Ratio Blue-Chip Stocks Offering Both Quality and Value,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-low-pe-ratio-blue-032135510.html,1679196095,STORY,"['CVX', 'ALB', 'NEM']","[For young investors, blue-chip stocks may seem relatively dull. The action tends to be in the growth and penny stocks space. However, it will be a big mistake to ignore the value-creating upside blue-chip stocks provide, when constructing a long-term portfolio.If the business story for a growth stock clicks, multi-bagger returns are in the offering. However, it’s not uncommon to see emerging stories fail, leading to massive stock plunges in short order. We’ve seen this play out time and again in recent years, highlighting the stability and steadiness blue-chip stocks create for a portfolio.I would personally allocate 50% of my portfolio toward blue-chip stocks. That’s partly due to the multiple headwinds that have proliferated in equity markets since the beginning of 2022. These headwinds have created a situation where some high-quality stocks are now trading at very attractive valuations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsExposure to these fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks makes sense, as there is visibility for healthy total returns (capital gains and dividends) over the long-term. Let’s discuss the reasons why these blue-chip stocks are worth considering.NEMNewmont$48.14ALBAlbermarle$208.51CVXChevron$151.78Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockAs I write this article, gold has surged to $1,930 an ounce. Considering the ongoing concerns in the banking sector, sticky inflation, and the increased possibility of a recession, I expect this bullish momentum to sustain. Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is a quality gold miner to consider adding, for exposure to the price action of precious metals right now.Currently, NEM stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.2-times, with a dividend yield of 3.5%. Considering the upside potential with gold prices, I expect healthy dividend growth in 2023 and beyond.Newmont Corporation has an investment-grade balance sheet and a quality asset base. With 96 million ounces in reserves, the company expects steady production into the 2040s. Newmont also hopes to lower its all-in-sustaining cost over the next few years. Thus, the company’s free cash flow upside will likely be significant if gold trends higher.Story continuesIt’s also worth noting that Newmont closed 2022 with a liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. Further, the company’s leverage ratio is low, at 0.5. With high financial flexibility, I would not be surprised if the company pursued opportunistic acquisitions to boost production.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a massively undervalued blue-chip stock. I expect ALB stock to double in the next 12 months. To put things into perspective, the stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.2-times, and is among the top dividend growth stocks to consider.The company’s undervaluation is evident, when investors assess Albermarle’s growth trajectory. Last year, Albemarle reported 193% and 444% year-over-year growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. The company has guided for sales growth from 55% to 75% for the current year. The company will also likely report operating cash flow of $2.2 billion for the year. With these metrics, the stock deserves better valuations.Another point worth mentioning is that Albemarle closed 2022 with a lithium conversion capacity of 200ktpa. The company expects to boost production to 550ktpa (mid-range of guidance) by 2027. With continued upside in capacity, cash flow growth is likely to remain healthy over the long-term.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another name to consider among undervalued blue-chip stocks. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 10-times, the stock is poised for meaningful upside from current levels. Additionally, CVX stock offers a rather juicy dividend yield of 3.9%.It’s worth noting that oil has declined on recession concerns. However, CVX stock has held its ground, trading sideways over the last six months. This is an indication of the stock’s undervaluation. Once economic headwinds wane, CVX stock can easily trade above previous highs of $190.From a fundamental perspective, Chevron is among the best oil and gas stocks out there. The company has an investment-grade balance sheet, bolstered by operating cash flow of $47.5 billion for 2022.With low break-even assets, I think operating cash flow is likely to remain robust, even factoring in the recent decline in oil prices. This will continue to allow Chevron the ability to create value through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, the company has ample flexibility to make significant capital investments to improve its metrics over time.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The asset typically has a low correlation with the stock, bond, and crypto markets, so it’s prudent to invest in the best gold stocks now.2022 was an incredibly tough year for financial markets. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 19.4%, while the crypto market and 30-Year U.S. Treasury Bond futures shed 64% and 21.6% of their values in 2022. Conversely, the growth in the gold futures contract remained flat. These results reinforce my earlier point about the low correlation of yellow metals with capital markets. Having said that, the markets are still remarkably volatile, pushing the need for investments in safe-haven assets, including these best of the best gold stocks.NEMNewmont Corporation$48.17KGCKinross Gold$4.13GOLDBarrick Gold$18.12AEMAgnico Eagle Mines$50.84GFIGold Fields$11.55FNVFranco-Nevada$143.50BVNCompania de Minas Buenaventura$8.35Best Gold Stocks: Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockLeading the list of best gold stocks is Denver-based Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), one of the largest gold miners with a sparkling track record of producing growth across both lines. In addition to gold, it is also involved in producing other precious metals, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe volatility in gold prices, the adverse economic climate, and the supply chain crisis last year resulted in negative top-line growth. However, it has done well to control costs and produce relatively strong margins on a trailing twelve-month basis. Additionally, it boasts a whopping $3.2 billion cash balance and a levered free cash flow margin of 11.6%, which points to its robust flexibility. Once gold prices start picking up the pace again, I expect NEM stock to follow and then some. Additionally, with 96 million ounces of proven reserves, Newmont has tremendous cash flow visibility through the decade.Story continuesBest Gold Stocks: Kinross Gold (KGC)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is a penny gold stock poised for a massive upside if gold prices start gaining again. Kinross’s top and bottom-line results improved substantially with the strength in gold prices during the first few months of 2022. In the following months, the firm was able to offset the drop in gold prices with higher production.It wrapped up its most recent quarter with a 75% bump in gold production to 595,683 equivalent gold ounces (Au eq. oz.). Moreover, the firm expects production to be at 2.1 million Au eq. oz. in 2023, 140,000 Au eq. oz. higher compared to last year. Also, it expects a 5% increase in all-sustaining costs to $1,271/oz. Nevertheless, with a dividend yield of 3.1% and KGC stock trading at multi-year lows, you have a long-term winner poised for big gains ahead.Barrick Gold (GOLD)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) represents the crème de la crème in gold mining. The Canadian company operates 13 gold and copper mines across Nevada to sub-Saharan Africa under the dynamic leadership of its CEO, Mark Bristow.The company has been one of the most profitable businesses in the sector, generating almost 50% EBITDA margins over the past five years. Moreover, despite a tough 2022, its profitability metrics were mostly in-line with its historical averages. Its fourth-quarter results showed a 13% sequential increase in gold production at a slightly higher realized gold price of $1,728/oz. All-in-sustaining costs dropped to $1,242/oz from $1,269/oz in the third quarter. For fiscal 2023, it expects to produce 4.2 million to 4.6 million oz of gold, halting a three-year decline.Another massive opportunity for the company comes from its copper mining division, which contributes 18% to total revenues. That number could grow substantially over the next several years due to multiple long-term projects in development.Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)A gold bar along with some coins made of precious metals. gold stocksSource: allstars / Shutterstock.comAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) was arguably the best gold producer last year despite a challenging cost and workforce environment. It marched forward with superior cost control, with record margins exceeding its 5-year averages. Moreover, it progressed its expansion projects to grow mineral resources and aimed to consolidate its position in the most lucrative mining jurisdictions.The miner’s aggressive merger and acquisition activity, along with effective execution, led to a rapid increase in gold mineral reserves. Year-end 2022 gold mineral reserves rose 9% to 48.7 million Au eq. oz. on the back of record annualized production. Its payable gold production was at 3.280,731 Au eq. oz., a whopping 62% increase from last year. A hefty chunk of the increase was attributable to the integration of Kirkland Lake Gold, another in the long list of companies AEM has acquired over the years.Another element of its bull case is its solid dividend profile, where payouts have grown by seven years with a yield of 3.3%. Its 5-year growth rates stand at an impressive 30.7%.Gold Fields (GFI)Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockGold Fields (NYSE:GFI) is one of the top gold mining firms in the resource-rich South African region. The firm operates mines in South Africa, Australia, Peru, and Ghana per its profile. GFI stock shed 30% of its value last year, with structural headwinds weighing down the stock.Perhaps the biggest obstacle hindering Gold Fields was South Africa’s energy crisis last year due to Eskom’s collapse. However, despite the concerns over load curtailment, the firm Wits Basin mine stood strong, delivering spectacular results last year, as production levels and free cash flows shot up 12% and 33%, respectively.Furthermore, production from its Australia segment surged by 4% from the prior-year period despite the weather delays. Moreover, after multiple delays, its open-cast gold-silver project in Chile should start production this year. The asset could potentially host top-tier oxidized minerals that could be effectively mined at low costs. Therefore, there is a lot to look forward to with GFI stock.Franco-Nevada (FNV)Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10Source: ShutterstockFranco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is a precious metals firm specializing in gold-focused royalties and streaming. Instead of mining assets, it funds mining firms for a percentage of sales or mined precious metals. FNV stock presents itself as a relatively safe bet in a volatile trading environment. This notion is shown by its high-quality profitability metrics, which show gross and EBITDA margins of 87% and 84% on a trailing twelve-month basis.As per its latest report, FNV boasted $2.2 billion in available capital, zero debt, and $1 billion in operational cash flows. Moreover, its levered free cash flows are over 50%, mind-boggling considering the volatility in the business environment. With its disciplined capital management and low-risk business model, FNV stock should stay strong for the foreseeable future.Compania de Minas Buenaventura (BVN)gold stored in a vault to represent gold stocksSource: ShutterstockCompania de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE:BVN) operates a high-quality precious metals business in Peru.Peru’s mining sector has always been crucial to its economy. It’s the second-largest producer of copper and a major producer of silver, zinc, and other minerals. Moreover, it has a solid ecosystem for mining, including rich mineral resources, favorable government policies,  a skilled workforce, and a strong small-scale mining environment. Therefore, it will always remain relevant in mining, boosting BVN stock’s attractiveness.It was a familiar tone to BVN’s quarterlies compared to other gold miners discussed in the article. Its fourth-quarter results were relatively heartening, beating estimates on both lines while effectively narrowing down the losses. Its cash position reached an impressive $253.9 million at the conclusion of December, while net debt decreased by $484.6 million. The stock trades under $8, making it worth betting on for the long haul.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Intel Corporation (INTC) and MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI).

The company’s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intel’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-39.8% vs. -9.7%). The company is facing challenging macroeconomic environment, uncertain business conditions and softening demand trends are likely to remain an overhang on Intel’s performance. In addition, production delays remain a concern.Imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden are other headwinds. Intensifying competition, inflated raw material costs and signs of market saturation are worrisome.However, Intel is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market. Healthy traction from Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management are tailwinds.(You can read the full research report on Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of MercadoLibre have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+39.2% vs. -9.7%). The company is benefiting from strength in the commerce and fintech businesses. Robust product offerings and credit portfolio expansion are respectively driving the company’s commerce and fintech revenues.Further, robust mobile-point-of-sale business and growing adoption of MercadoPago are driving the total payment volume growth of the company. Our estimate suggests that the total payment volume is likely to witness a 30% rise in the current year from the last year’s figure.Also, rapid adoption of Mobile Wallet remains a positive. Further, robust shipments growth via MercadoEnvios is another positive.

He totaled 104.63 points, overtaking Malinin by 4.25 on home ice in Saitama.Malinin, who this season landed the first quadruple Axel in competition, had a clean short after struggling with the program all autumn. He landed a quadruple Lutz-triple toe combo, a quad toe and a triple Axel. Uno beat him on artistic component scores.“I was really in the moment,” said Malinin, who plans a record-tying six quads in Saturday’s free skate after attempting five at previous competitions this season. “I was really feeling my performance out there.”FIGURE SKATING WORLDS: Results | Broadcast ScheduleThe quad Axel is not allowed in the short program, but expect Malinin to include it in the free, and he likely needs it to beat Uno.Malinin has been a force in skating, starting with his breakout silver-medal finish at the January 2022 U.S. Championships. He was left off last year’s Olympic team due to his inexperience, then won the world junior title last spring.He entered these senior worlds ranked second in the field behind Uno, yet outside the top 15 in the world in the short program this season. After a comfortable win at January’s national championships, he can become the youngest men’s world champion since Russian Alexei Yagudin in 1998.Two-time U.S. Olympian Jason Brown placed sixth with a clean short in his first full international competition since last year’s Olympics.The third American, Andrew Torgashev, fell on his opening quad toe loop and ended up 22nd in his worlds debut.Story continuesOlympic gold medalist Nathan Chen has not skated this season, going back to Yale, and is not expected to return to competition.

There are more opportunities to help the local communities by investing in their livelihoods as well,"" he told AFP at the mine.Its current workforce numbers 280 but could more than double in coming years.The reopening coincided with the gold price rising to $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year.- Cyanide, arsenic -There was widespread alarm in neighbouring communities about a decade ago when mass blood testing found some villagers had elevated levels of heavy metals, including arsenic, manganese and cyanide.The mine denied responsibility, saying arsenic and manganese occurred naturally in the area.Thailand's industry minister at the time said an inquiry could not conclusively link villagers' health complaints to the mine, but recommended it be shut for the ""benefit of society"".The mine, some 280 km (170 miles) north of Bangkok, was a big economic player in a poor rural area, directly employing 1,000 people.Story continuesRehired workers say losing their jobs took a devastating toll. Many were forced to leave children with grandparents to find work far away, while scores of small businesses shut.Akara senior human resources officer, Chalita Kongpradab, was pregnant when she was made redundant and had to scratch together a living as a fish and noodle vendor.""It barely helped me to survive. Some days I could only sell one bowl of noodles,"" she said, crying.- Community funding -While many in the area welcome the economic boost, some told AFP anonymously that they were still worried about chemicals and metals.Others were concerned about blast noise and dust causing respiratory illnesses.""For the people living close to the mine like me, I'd like to be moved out first,"" said Dao Seehawatr, 59.Kinnaird said the company would be more responsive and closely monitor noise, dust and locals' health.Thai academic Nattavud Pimpa characterised the mine in 2015 as a ""lesson in failed community management"". He told AFP this week there were signs the company had ""learned to engage deeply with the community"".Akara general manager of sustainability Cherdsak Utha-aroon said some royalties would go to a community support fund, as well as a health-monitoring programme.Chatree produced more than 1.8 million ounces of gold and nine million ounces of silver between 2001-2017.pit-lpm/pdw/pbt]"

Miura fell on their throw triple loop in the free, but their 6.08-point cushion from the short was enough as the Americans also had jumping errors.“I know it wasn’t our best free skate, but I told [Miura] we should be proud of ourselves,” Kihara said, according to the International Skating Union. “I told her to look up at the audience, look at how many people are cheering for us. I didn’t know how the result would turn out, but I told her let’s be proud of ourselves and go home with pride. Hearing the crowd for the other pairs, I knew they all skated well, so all three of us [including coach Bruno Marcotte] just prayed waiting for our score. I’m not sure why we got a personal best score.”Italians Sara Conti and Niccolo Macii took bronze, denying a medal for fourth-place Canadians Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps.Stellato-Dudek, 39, was trying to become the oldest world medalist in decades, after winning the 2000 World junior silver medal in singles and ending a 15-year retirement in 2016.FIGURE SKATING WORLDS: Results | Broadcast ScheduleMiura, 21, and Kihara, 30, have trained in Ontario since teaming in 2019, just about the time that Kihara was ready to retire after two Olympics with other partners and a recent concussion. They ranked outside the top 20 pairs in the world that first season, but since set milestones for pairs in Japan, which has a rich figure skating history in singles events.They placed 10th at the 2021 Worlds, then seventh at the February 2022 Olympics and took silver behind Knierim and Frazier at the March 2022 Worlds, which included none of the top teams from Russia (banned) and China (haven’t competed since the Olympics).Story continuesThey went undefeated this season despite not returning to full training until mid-September after an offseason of skating shows and Miura’s shoulder injury.Now, they join a list of world champions in one of Japan’s most popular sports that was previously all solo acts. It began with Midori Ito in 1989 and continued through 2006 Olympic champion Shizuka Arakawa, three-time world champion Mao Asada and two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu.“With this result, it would be very much appreciated if new boys or girls would want to take on the challenge to start pairs,” Kihara said, according to the ISU. “I hope more pair skaters will increase, and in 10 or 20 years, people will look back to this day and say this day was the turning point for the Japanese pair discipline.”Knierim, 31, and Frazier, 30, have said they will likely retire after this season, though they also thought they would stop after last season. They competed this week without Todd Sand, one of their primary coaches, who has been hospitalized after a March 2 heart attack.“This whole week, this whole time, this program, it was all for our coach — and that’s what our hearts are,” Knierim said, according to the ISU. “[I felt] fulfillment because I gave it everything I could and, for me, that’s always enough when you know that you’ve exhausted all of yourself to make the best opportunity.“I was very proud of us. We never dreamed that we would have two world medals, and for us this is an achievement, and the color is beautiful.”If Knierim and Frazier retire, it’s clear that Emily Chan and Spencer Howe will become the leading U.S. pair.

Finely balanced markets for oil, LNG, and coal are leveraged to a super-charged Chinese bounce,” WoodMac’s analysts wrote.Crude oil will be a big winner of the Chinese reopening, with prices set to increase, they noted. China has a history of over-delivering on its economic growth targets, with GDP growth outpacing government forecasts in 12 of the past 18 years, according to WoodMac. The consultancy ran two scenarios for China’s reopening – a base-case scenario with 5.5% growth and a high-growth scenario with growth at 7% this year. The high-grow scenario is far from certain, but given China’s history of under-promising and over-delivering, it cannot be easily discounted, the consultancy said.“Depending on its consumers’ appetite to spend and the ambition of government policy, China’s reopening could once again turn up the heat on prices across the energy and natural resources spectrum,” it added.Under WoodMac’s base-case scenario, Chinese oil demand would rise by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, driving the expected 2.6-million-bpd growth in global oil consumption. Barring a significant recession, WoodMac sees Brent Crude rising from current levels to average $89.40 a barrel for 2023.In a high-growth scenario, the world’s top crude oil importer could see oil demand jumping by 1.4 million bpd on the year, or about 400,000 bpd higher than in the base case, driving up oil prices by another $3-$5 per barrel compared to the base case. “As the Chinese economy reopens, commodity prices will not return to the extreme highs of 2022,” WoodMac’s analysts said.Story continues“But energy and natural resource markets remain finely balanced and commodity prices could yet surprise to the upside this year.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Xi Set To Meet With Putin In Moscow Next WeekStandard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffA North Sea Hydrogen Pipeline Network Is PossibleRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

On March 14, a U.S. drone was shot down by a Russian fighter jet over the black sea. The Russian Su-27 damaged the propellor of the American MQ-9 Reaper drone, after flying in close proximity over it, and forced it down. Meanwhile, the Ukraine war is still ongoing and there is still no end in sight, rather there is a risk of the war escalating.Defense Analyst: ""There's A Pretty Good Long-Term Setup""On February 13 Cowen's defense and aerospace analyst, Roman Schweizer appeared in an interview on CNBC and to discuss the geopolitical situation and his view on the defense sector and defense stocks. ""This is a very peculiar period in time"", said Schweizer as he talked about the recent airborne objects shot down in North America. Schweizer thinks that unidentified objects flying at such high altitude can pose risk to commercial air travel. Here are some comments from Roman Schweizer about the U.S. defense budget, potential budget cuts, and defense stocks:""I'd say that the group (defense stocks) has underperformed, since the GOP (Republicans) kinda came out with wanting those what would be potentially 10% spending cuts. Really, when you look at the backlog in spending, 2 years ago the budget was up 7%, last year up 10%. We estimate there's about $37 billion in funds for Ukraine that haven't been put on contract for some of the large defense primes. So the pump is primed and as soon as we get into some of the budgetary details, if any of that overhang lifts, it certainly is gonna bode well for the companies.""Roman Schweizer is positive on the defense sector and sees it driving outperformance. Schweizer thinks the consensus is that the Ukraine war is a ""multi-year conflict"" and defense spending is going up in not just the U.S., but also in Japan and Europe. Schweizer also noted that the supply-chain issues and labor shortages due to COVID-19 are also fading away and the defense sector is ""starting to operate better"". Finally, Roman Schweizer said that he thinks ""there's a pretty good long-term setup"" for defense stocks.Story continuesAs the Ukraine war enters its second year, geopolitical risk is rising and defense spending is going up with it. On March 13, the U.S. Department of Defense released the proposed defense budget for fiscal 2024. The Biden-Harris Administration has submitted a request to Congress to increase the defense budget for fiscal 2024 to $842 billion, up $26 billion from fiscal 2023.Amid rising geopolitical tensions, the outlook for the defense sector is starting to look attractive.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Details of the DealValued at $17.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 15, 2024. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will offer technical support system for Abrams Tank.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Sterling Heights, MI.Significance of Abrams TankThe M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams is the most advanced main battle tank. It sports features that are technologically advanced in communications, fire control and lethality, reliability, sustainment and fuel efficiency, along with upgraded armor. Additionally, the SEPv3 Abrams is designed to seamlessly accept future upgrades.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military spending has witnessed an increase in the past few years to modernize and upgrade the defense system to meet the current warfare requirements. In such a scenario, the demand for military tanks has increased by leaps &amp; bounds as these form an integral part of any land warfare system.General Dynamics stands to benefit from this increased demand. This is because its Land Systems is the sole-source producer of two foundational products of the U.S. Army’s warfighting capabilities — the M1A2Abrams main battle tank and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle.The company strives to continuously improvise on the combat vehicle platform and provide an upgraded version to its customers. GD is maximizing the effectiveness and lethality of the Army’s tank fleet with next-generation Abrams upgrades. This will provide technological advancements in terms of communications, power generation, fuel efficiency, optics and armor.The company is also developing an Abrams SEPv4 configuration with additional advanced capabilities, incorporating next-generation electronic architecture technology. This will allow the platform to adopt and incorporate transformative capabilities in the future.Story continuesSuch capability in manufacturing combat vehicles must have enabled General Dynamics to win multiple orders for Abrams Tank as well as system and sustainment technical support services contracts involving the same. The latest contract win is a testament to this. These have bolstered the defense giant’s revenue generation prospects from combat vehicles.Growth ProspectsPer the report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% by 2027 from 2022. The expanding size of the market should benefit General Dynamics as it has an established position in the aforesaid market.Other defense majors that are likely to benefit are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX .BAE Systems designs, manufactures, upgrades and supports tracked, specialty-tracked, and wheeled and amphibious combat vehicles. Some of its combat vehicles include the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, CV90, CV90MkIV, CV90 IFV, etc.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than 5 million units built in the last five years.It specializes in innovating low-cost, highly reliable precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.Raytheon is currently teaming up with American Rheinmetall Vehicles to meet the U.S. Army’s current requirement for a true, next-generation Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, namely the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle.The Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle is a next-generation, tracked, armored fighting vehicle, designed to address the critical challenges of the future battlefield.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of General Dynamics have lost 6.8% compared with the industry’s 14.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.NRG Energy in FocusNRG Energy (NRG) is headquartered in Houston, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 4.31% since the start of the year. The power company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.38 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.55%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. NRG Energy has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 101.82%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 56%. This means it paid out 56% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.54 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 73.28%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NRG continues to expand through organic and inorganic initiatives. The company’s services for a wide variety of customers and focus on emission cuts will boost its long-term growth. NRG’s dividend policy and repurchase of shares will further increase its shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has to face certain headwinds, such as stiff competition in the wholesale power markets and risks related to disruptions in the fuel delivery system.TailwindsRecently, NRG completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, which will form a leading provider in the essential home solutions market and create a unique end-to-end ecosystem, driven by unparalleled data and insights. The deal will also improve and diversify NRG’s financial profile with more predictable earnings through Vivint’s subscription-based model and long-term customer agreements.The company is focusing on clean generation to lower emissions. It targets to achieve a 50% emission cut by 2025 and net-zero emissions by 2050 from the 2014 baseline. NRG entered renewable power purchase agreements totaling 2.4 Gigawatts (GW) with third-party project developers and other counterparties. It continues to optimize its generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development.NRG Energy continues to increase dividend and attract investors. In January 2023, the company declared that its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share, indicating an 8% increase from the previous year. This resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.51 per share. The hike is in sync with the company’s long-term annual dividend growth target rate of 7-9% per share. Capital allocation for 2023-2025 is $6.5-$7 billion, out of which 35-40% will be utilized for share repurchases, around 15% for payment of dividend, 10-15% for Vivint growth, 20-25% for debt reduction and 10% for the Vivint acquisition. The capital allocation plan will further strengthen the company’s balance sheet and increase shareholders’ value over the aforesaid period.Story continuesHeadwindsThe financial performance of NRG's retail operations may suffer from volatile electricity, and gas supply costs and demand. The gas sold by the company in retail and wholesale markets is purchased from third parties. Foreign currency fluctuation and cyber-based security risk may also impede its growth.NRG Energy’s costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be adversely impacted by the disruption in its fuel supplies. This is because the company relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel the majority of its power generation facilities. These facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in power production in case of counterparty failure or a disturbance in the fuel delivery system.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are MGE Energy, Inc.

275,5c5e2c9a-be4a-3521-8a93-b4312356db8b,NRG,2023-03-23,"Need To Know: Analysts Are Much More Bullish On NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) Revenues",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-analysts-much-more-bullish-102526007.html,1679480726,STORY,['NRG'],"[NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's statutory forecasts. The revenue forecast for this year has experienced a facelift, with the analysts now much more optimistic on its sales pipeline. The stock price has risen 7.7% to US$33.19 over the past week, suggesting investors are becoming more optimistic. Whether the upgrade is enough to drive the stock price higher is yet to be seen, however.After the upgrade, the consensus from NRG Energy's three analysts is for revenues of US$18b in 2023, which would reflect a stressful 42% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Per-share earnings are expected to jump 65% to US$8.67. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.53 in 2023. It seems analyst sentiment has certainly become more bullish on revenues, even though they haven't changed their view on earnings per share. View our latest analysis for NRG Energy earnings-and-revenue-growthEven though revenue forecasts increased, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$39.67, suggesting the analysts are focused on earnings as the driver of value creation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values NRG Energy at US$52.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$30.00. This shows there is still some diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 42% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 31% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 3.7% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that NRG Energy's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most obvious conclusion from this consensus update is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with analysts holding earnings per share steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting revenues to grow slower than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at NRG Energy.Analysts are definitely bullish on NRG Energy, but no company is perfect. Indeed, you should know that there are several potential concerns to be aware of, including its declining profit margins.

The theme of the month is embracing equity - an action that rejects bias, makes progress for equality, and fosters psychological safety. These themes are embedded in our culture, and we continue to strive toward creating a safe space for everyone.We joined the conversation by putting a spotlight on five incredible women leading Business Resource Groups (BRGs) at our company. BRGs are employee-led collectives that foster community and contribute to workplace culture. We learned more about each woman's experiences and how they are embracing equity in their day-to-day.Meet the womenAshley Osei-Kuffour - Senior Associate, Sustainability &amp; PartnershipsAshley co-leads the Early Career Success (ECS) BRG. This group empowers members to enhance their professional development through a network dedicated to career growth, interpersonal relationships, and cross-functional learning.Mareza Lopez - Manager, Go To Marketing AcquisitionMayra Morales - Pricing AnalystMareza and Mayra are co-leaders of Hola! Club, a Hispanic/Latin BRG with a mission to foster cultural diversity, understanding, and inclusiveness.Reneé Meaux - Director, National Partnership DevelopmentReneé is one of the leaders of Women in Power (WIP). Their mission is to empower, strengthen, and connect female employees to foster growing careers.Renuka Joopelli - Senior IT Project ManagerRenuka is an active member of VIVIDH which serves as a platform for South Asian employees to educate and share their culture with everyone.What does #embracingequity mean to you?Embracing equity starts with acknowledging that there is a gap. It also involves recognizing that every human being holds different experiences and unique perspectives that are essential to growth. Whether that be from a professional standpoint or a societal one. When there's fairness, everyone feels valued, and we all succeed. - AshleyStory continuesFor me, that means making sure that everyone has access to the same opportunities while taking into account that the differences in our backgrounds and where we come from can create barriers to participation. It's also ensuring that everyone gets the necessary tools to be successful and that those tools are what is best for them. - MarezaEmbracing equity is ensuring everyone is not only present but being heard. It's also having thoughts and opinions across all genders, races, and ages. It means everyone is acknowledged, considered, and valued. - ReneéEmbracing equity is creating an environment where everyone feels included and valued at work. It's also providing the resources specific to their needs no matter their gender, age, race, or position. This fosters a positive work experience and increased productivity resulting in better service to our company. - RenukaWhat have you learned from women in the workplace?One of the biggest things I've learned is how to be adaptable. You always have to be open to change and ready to pivot. If you're always thinking everything has to fit the status quo, then it'll be hard to move forward in your career. I've learned that from many women across the organization and throughout my professional development. I hope to pass it along to others as they're building their careers. - AshleyWhat would you go back and tell your younger self?You are smart, you are capable, and you deserve a seat at the table. If they don't want to give you a seat at the table, then make your own table. Bring your own chair. You are where you're at because you work hard and deserve it. Don't doubt yourself. You have so much to give, so share that and empower other people. - MarezaWhy is it important to have women represented in leadership roles?I was reading an article that said there were only two female CEOs in Fortune 500 companies back in 2000. Now, we've got 53. That speaks volumes, and it lets that little girl watching know, 'if they've done it, why can't I?' When I see women leaders who have climbed up the ladder in our company, I see that could be me one day. It also motivates me to know that my children can see women leaders doing big things. - MayraOne of the biggest reasons is for people to see what's possible. We all come from different backgrounds, perspectives, and privileges. If we were in a company where women were not present in leadership, my perspective of potential opportunity would be much more limited than what it is today. - ReneéHow do you help other women enhance their skills in the workplace?I would encourage them to speak up. One way to do that is by making introductions and connecting women to each other. At NRG, I've learned that I can get mentorships that help elevate not only myself but others. - MayraI've had the opportunity here at NRG to advance as a leader. One of my favorite things has been getting to help other people develop and become leaders themselves. The best thing I can do as a leader is to give honest feedback and not be afraid of challenging conversations because those are often opportunities for the biggest growth. - ReneéWhat woman from the past or present has inspired you the most?I was born and raised in India and migrated to the US when I got married. My parents lived in a rural area when I was born, but my mother worked hard to ensure that I got the best education. She sent me to live with my aunt and uncle during my childhood in a far-off urban city where I attended one of the best schools and colleges. I am forever grateful to my mother for paving my future and my aunt for raising me with great values. - RenukaCelebrating women everywhereWe enjoyed learning more about a few of the women at NRG and are proud to have this opportunity to highlight their affinity groups, voices, and accomplishments.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NextEra Energy in FocusNextEra Energy (NEE) is headquartered in Juno Beach, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of -9.86% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.47 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.48%. In comparison, the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield is 3.21%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.74%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.87 is up 10% from last year. In the past five-year period, NextEra Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 10.75%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, NextEra's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NEE is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $3.12 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.59%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NEE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends consecutively for 25 years or more. These stocks are popular among investors because they can generate stable and regular income for them, which tends to grow over time. In addition to this, these securities provide protection during market downturns. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022. The report also mentioned that during the 15 worst-performing months for the S&amp;P 1500 during the same period, the high-yield index fell by 7.29%, compared with a 9.58% decline in the S&amp;P Composite 1500.When investing in dividend growers, investors look beyond yield and focus on other factors, including value, cash flow, and other business fundamentals. Companies that have proven records of dividend growth remain committed to their shareholder obligation and signal that they have the ability to raise their dividends in the long term. Washington Crossing Advisors referred to data by Ned Davis Research and revealed that dividend growers delivered a higher return with lower volatility when compared with ordinary dividend payers, non-dividend companies, and dividend cutters. The report mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014 with a 15.9% annual risk. In comparison, dividend cutters returned 3.4% during this period with an annual risk of 25.1%.Dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance during inflationary periods. The same report highlighted that companies with solid dividend growth returned 6.5% from 1972 to 2014 when inflation was above 4%, compared with a negative 7.9% return of the dividend cutters.Story continuesThe arguments discussed above show that investing in quality companies with strong cash flow can protect investors from market downturns. Mike Morey, the chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, spoke to Business Insider about his winning strategy to invest in companies with solid cash generation. Here are some comments from the fund manager:""We don't have to worry about what the Fed is doing; we don't have to worry about the economic cycle. Just simply by focusing on quality companies with strong free cash flows is going to get you through any economic cycle. And looking at performance over a full cycle, we're confident we can deliver superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis.""He also recommended buying stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) because of their growth and strong balance sheets.Considering these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend aristocrat stocks in this article.14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 14 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational medical device company, headquartered in Ireland, Dublin. In its recent quarterly earnings, the company reported a strong cash position. At the end of January 2023, it had over $4.5 billion available in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $3.7 billion in the prior-year period. In nine months that ended January, the company's operating cash flow came in at $3.8 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $2.5 billion.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share on March 2. In 2022, the company took its dividend growth streak to 45 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.42%, as of March 20. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 with a Hold rating on the shares, following the company's recent quarterly earnings. The firm also expects the company to report strong fiscal 2024 guidance.At the end of Q4 2022, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) was a part of 58 hedge fund portfolios, up from 55 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's data. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced disappointing clinical trial results for a new product in its pipeline and lowered its fiscal 2023 financial guidance due to lingering supply chain issues and slower than expected medical procedure recovery.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock in March and mentioned that the company's tax litigation risk is 'well discounted'. The firm also noted that the company could see resilient consumption this year.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as recorded on March 20.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s cash position remained strong in FY22. The company's operating cash flow came in at $11 billion, whereas its free cash flow for the year stood at $9.5 billion. It remained committed to its shareholder return as it distributed over $7.6 billion to investors in dividends during the year.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q4 2022. Overall, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, worth $28.8 billion collectively.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American medical device and healthcare company that provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. Recently, the company announced the FDA approval for its blood-based laboratory test for traumatic brain injury. This lab test will give results in 18 minutes and is the first commercially available laboratory test in the US.On February 17, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its payouts for 51 years, which places it as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based renewable energy company that mainly specializes in energy infrastructure.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

In the past six months, the stock has gained 5.43%, as of the close of March 19.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts regularly for 50 years. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.59%, as of March 20.In addition to PEP, analysts and investors are positive about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).At the end of December 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Fundsmith LLP was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure.

To skip the industry analysis and the recent market behavior around the stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now.The alternative fuel or renewable energy industry is one of the trending industries in the world at the moment. We previously reported that the renewable energy sector is expected to grow at 4% per annum and the annual supply and production investments will reach around $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion by 2035. Wind, solar, hydropower, and biofuel energy are all examples of alternative or renewable fuels.Wind Energy MarketThe wind energy market is the fastest-growing renewable energy industry with a forecasted CAGR of 9.4% between 2021 and 2030. The global wind energy market was valued at $77.77 billion which is expected to reach $174.75 billion by 2030. The International Energy Agency reported that wind generation increased by 17% in 2021 to 273 TerraWatt per hour (1 TerraWatt = 8,760 TerraWatt/hour), representing a 55% higher growth than the prior year.In 2021, China accounted for 70% of the total wind energy growth, followed by the U.S. at a meager 14%. However, due to low wind conditions, the EU saw a decline of 3% in wind power generation in the year. The U.S. installed 13.4 GigaWatts of wind capacity in 2021 and the industry serves around 40 million homes in the country and employs around 120,000 people.Solar Power MarketThe solar power market size was around $167.84 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% to $373.84 billion in 2029. Solar power is the second fastest-growing renewable energy source after wind and hit 1 Terrawatt of generation capacity in 2022. Between 2018 and 2021, the global solar capacity doubled and saw a huge surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic while representing a growth of 17% in 2020 from the previous year. According to a SolarPower Europe report, the global solar power capacity is expected to reach 2.3 TerraWatt in 2025.Story continuesAccording to the International Energy Agency, in 2021, the solar power generation capacity grew by 22% globally. China was responsible for the most significant growth as it accounted for 38% of the solar photovoltaic technology growth, followed by the U.S. at 17%, and the EU at 10%.Hydro Electric Power MarketHydropower is one of the oldest sources of renewable energy. In the United States, it accounted for 31.5% of renewable energy electricity generation. Globally, it accounted for 17% of the total electricity generation in 2020. The global hydropower market size was $236.4 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.16% to $371.8 billion by 2030. Hydropower is the largest renewable energy source in the world with 4,327 GigaWatts of generation capacity in 2021. However, in the same year, due to its high dependence on water, its generation capacity decreased by 0.4% globally. The droughts in countries such as Brazil, the United States, Turkey, China, India, and Canada were one of the main reasons for the decline in hydropower electricity generation capacity.Renewable Energy MarketBy 2027, the International Energy Agency predicts that the total renewable energy generation is expected to increase by 60%. One of the most significant factors of clean energy growth is its low cost. With uncertainties in the conventional energy market, as seen post-Russia-Ukraine war, new solar or wind power plants sometimes have a lower cost of electricity generation than the existing conventional energy generation facilities. Additionally, the tax incentives to renewable energy companies through the Inflation Reduction Act are another major growth driver for the clean energy industry.Currently, coal is the largest source of electricity generation but the IEA expects that renewable energy electricity generation is expected to double in the next 5 years and will surpass coal.Over the past few days, the renewable energy market, especially solar, was significantly hit by the Silicon Valley Bank crash. Recently, clean energy stocks like Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) fell, while related ETFs like Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) also took a hit.The global clean energy market might have hit a snag due to the recent uncertainties in the equities market but it is bound to grow at a remarkable pace in the long term. Some of the biggest players in the clean energy market are Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE).11 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right NowOur MethodologyAfter analyzing the global clean energy market, we chose the most popular alternative fuel stocks from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now11.

(NYSE:BEP), an underperformer in the fourth quarter, though we view Brookfield’s stable fundamentals (with &gt;90% of contracted cash flows having an average term of 14 years), inflation protection (~70% of power purchase agreements are indexed to inflation) and long-term growth opportunities as attractive in the current environment. Brookfield’s balance sheet is also relatively well-protected against rising rates given it has 97% fixed-rate debt with an average term to maturity of 12 years.”9. Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA) is one of the largest geothermal companies in the world. The company owns geothermal and energy recovery power plants and provides turbines, generators, and heat exchangers.

(NYSE:ORA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We shorted Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA) last year as the firm appeared to be an unprofitable geothermal-focused independent energy producer borrowing money to grow an even less-profitable U.S. renewables energy business. Along with eroding the company’s margins, we expected numerous executional challenges in the build-out of Ormat’s new U.S. renewable business. We got impatient as it increased from our short price of roughly $75 to $100, and we closed out the position. At the time, we noted the following:“Reviewed earnings [3rd Qtr 2022] and found that although execution had struggled, the impact was minimal, the future impact of the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] on the firm’s independent power production is uncertain (although almost assuredly positive), as such the business appears likely to maintain, at least for some period, its high earnings margins relative to independent power producing peers. We cannot find a reason to question the high margins’ near-term sustainability, but long-term sustainability should be in question. Nevertheless, we do not see a catalyst in the future to prompt a repricing or reevaluation of the multiple being placed on unsus[1]tainably high earnings or a catalyst that will send the high margins lower in short order, despite the fact the stock is clearly overvalued on fundamental earnings and cash flow basis. Absent a catalyst, it seemed prudent to exit the position.”…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Clearway Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:VST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“I sent the 2019 letter on February 10, 2020. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) closed that day at $22.27. As I write in early January the price is $22.30. Now I did say “We would actually prefer it if both (VST &amp; NRG) securities went nowhere for as long possible”—assuming repurchased shares at depressed valuations was our best-case scenario. But A) I didn’t think I’d be that right with respect to “nowhere”, and B) I certainly didn’t think I’d be right 3-years on. Here we are though, with the stock literally going nowhere for the last 3-years. Just like we drew it up!“Management has indeed repurchased 20.3% of the shares outstanding since year-end 2019 and will probably repurchase another 12-15% of the outstanding shares in 2023. My initial assumption was that management could plausibly repurchase 60% of their shares by 2030, leaving them with 200mn outstanding (that assumed shares were appreciating and they had to pay more as the years went on, not what’s transpired so far), but at the current pace of about 50mn shares repurchased per year, they’ll hit that mark by the end of 2026, which would imply free cash flow of $10 pershare if the underlying business continues to perform as it currently is. That’s a 45% FCF yield on today’s price. Meanwhile, dividends per share have grown 54% since 2019 and the stock now yields 3.5%, growing about 15% a year.Being paid to wait makes waiting much easier. We had sold VST shares in mid-2020, replacing some of the position with call options, to free up capital for other opportunities that became available. But when winter storm Uri hit Texas in February 2021 and VST shares went down 20%+, below $17 a share, we rebuilt our common equity position. Today VST oscillates between the biggest and second biggest position in the fund, depending on weekly performance.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now. Suggested Articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 11 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

285,0ec37c42-c202-3c2d-a103-c705d6da72ec,PDCO,2023-03-23,Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) shareholders have earned a 21% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/patterson-companies-nasdaq-pdco-shareholders-181725851.html,1679336245,STORY,['PDCO'],"[Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) shareholders have seen the share price descend 12% over the month. On the other hand the share price is higher than it was three years ago. However, it's unlikely many shareholders are elated with the share price gain of 57% over that time, given the rising market.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Patterson Companies achieved compound earnings per share growth of 58% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Patterson Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Patterson Companies' TSR for the last 3 years was 76%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Patterson Companies shareholders are down 16% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 12%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Patterson Companies has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which are a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

In 2023, URI is expected to witness another profitable year buoyed by federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power projects.This equipment rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +38.4%.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusBased in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -0.83%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.37 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.28%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 4.61%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.74%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.48 is up 4.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.78%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.83 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.23% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates.

For 2022, dividends set a record $564.6 billion payment, up 10.4% on an aggregate basis from 2021's $511.2 billion.Total shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $357.3 billion in Q4 2022, up 1.7% from Q3 2022's $351.2 billion and down 11.6% from Q4 2021's $404.0 billion.Total shareholder returns for 2022 increased to $1.487 trillion from the 2021 $1.393 trillion.On a proforma basis, the new 1% excise tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, would have reduced the Q4 2022 S&amp;P 500 operating earnings by 0.46% and as reported GAAP earnings by 0.58%, the proforma for 2022 was a 0.51% reduction for operating and a 0.58% reduction for as reported.Story continues""Companies, led by Financials, continued to pull back from their Q1 2022 record-breaking buyback expenditures, as energy remains the outlier, increasing its buybacks, as it set record profits,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""Share count reduction continues, as almost one-in-five issues increased their year-over-year EPS by at least 4% due to buybacks. The impact is expected to continue into 2023, even as economic indicators remain unclear at this point.""1% Buyback Excise Tax for 2023:On a proforma basis, the new 1% excise tax on net buybacks would have reduced Q4 2022 operating earnings by 0.46%, the same as the proforma 0.46% for Q3 2022, with as reported GAAP earnings being reduced by 0.58%, up from the proforma 0.52% for Q3 2022. For the proforma 2022 period, the tax would have cost S&amp;P 500 companies $8.5 billion, and would have reduced operating earnings by 0.51% and as reported GAAP earnings by 0.58%.Silverblatt added: ""The 1% tax is an additional cost, but it is still not significant enough to impact the overall buybacks at this point. In his proposed fiscal 2024 budget, President Biden quantified increasing the tax to 4%. Given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support, there is an expectation that some increase, and potential for change to the type of buybacks that are taxed, which could be incorporated into the fiscal budget. An increase to the 2.5% area could start to impact buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction due to some of the expenditures shifting from buybacks to dividends. Any shift however would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis, as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated in corporate budgets.""Q4 2022 and 2022 GICS® Sector Analysis:Information Technology continued to lead in buybacks as its percentage of buybacks and aggregate expenditures decreased for the quarter. In Q4 2022, IT's share decreased to 27.3% of all S&amp;P 500 buybacks compared to Q3 2022's 28.8% and was down from Q4 2021's 27.7%.

Over the 10-year period, the sector spent $1.892 trillion, representing 29.0% of the expenditures.Financials decreased their buybacks as their Q4 2022 expenditures decreased 2.3% to $22.5 billion, representing 10.7% of the buybacks, from the Q3 2022 $23.0 billion. As for Q4 2021 the sector spent $51.5 billion. The pullback was attributed to large-backs protecting their dividends with respect to the Fed's bank stress test. For 2022 the sector spent $121.4 billion, down 36.3% from 2021's 190.6 billion. Expenditures were expected to increase in Q1 2023. Of note however is the recent banking circumstances, which may reduce buybacks as companies focus more on dividends and liquidity.Energy decreased their buybacks as their expenditure declined 9.9% for the quarter to $19.8 billion, representing 9.4% of the buybacks compared to the prior quarter's $22.0 billion. However, this quarter was still an increase of 160% from Q4 2021 $7.6 billion level.

Trading in shares of the bank was halted several times due to volatility.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 382.6 points, or 1.2%, to 32,244.58, the S&amp;P 500 gained 34.93 points, or 0.89%, to 3,951.57 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.03 points, or 0.39%, to 11,675.54.Story continuesHelping optimism, New York Community Bancorp climbed 31.7% after a unit of the bank agreed to buy deposits and loans from Signature Bank.""Where it is another bank coming in, that is the kind of headline that helps underpin confidence in the banking system,"" Krosby said. ""It helps to halt the panic and fear.""Among other regional banks, PacWest Bancorp closed up 10.8% after the bank said deposit outflows had stabilized.Investors are also focused on the Fed's decision when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday. Before the turmoil with the banks earlier this month, many market participants had been factoring in a 50 basis-point interest rate hike from the Fed at its March meeting.Fed funds futures now show a 28.4% probability of the Fed holding its overnight rate at 4.5%-4.75%, and a 71.6% likelihood of a 25 basis-point increase, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.Shares of Amazon.com fell 1.3% on the day following the company's plans to slash another 9,000 jobs.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.48 billion shares, compared with the 12.60 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 298 new lows.

This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed.Today, we'll look at some top digital payments stocks, with the notable picks being PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Finely balanced markets for oil, LNG, and coal are leveraged to a super-charged Chinese bounce,” WoodMac’s analysts wrote.Crude oil will be a big winner of the Chinese reopening, with prices set to increase, they noted. China has a history of over-delivering on its economic growth targets, with GDP growth outpacing government forecasts in 12 of the past 18 years, according to WoodMac. The consultancy ran two scenarios for China’s reopening – a base-case scenario with 5.5% growth and a high-growth scenario with growth at 7% this year. The high-grow scenario is far from certain, but given China’s history of under-promising and over-delivering, it cannot be easily discounted, the consultancy said.“Depending on its consumers’ appetite to spend and the ambition of government policy, China’s reopening could once again turn up the heat on prices across the energy and natural resources spectrum,” it added.Under WoodMac’s base-case scenario, Chinese oil demand would rise by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, driving the expected 2.6-million-bpd growth in global oil consumption. Barring a significant recession, WoodMac sees Brent Crude rising from current levels to average $89.40 a barrel for 2023.In a high-growth scenario, the world’s top crude oil importer could see oil demand jumping by 1.4 million bpd on the year, or about 400,000 bpd higher than in the base case, driving up oil prices by another $3-$5 per barrel compared to the base case. “As the Chinese economy reopens, commodity prices will not return to the extreme highs of 2022,” WoodMac’s analysts said.Story continues“But energy and natural resource markets remain finely balanced and commodity prices could yet surprise to the upside this year.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Xi Set To Meet With Putin In Moscow Next WeekStandard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffA North Sea Hydrogen Pipeline Network Is PossibleRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio effectively guarantee that Amazon hangs onto its market share in this period of weakness. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well.Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Defense Stocks To Buy Now.A Chinese spy balloon along with 3 other unidentified high-altitude objects have been shot down by the U.S. so far. On March 14, a U.S. drone was shot down by a Russian fighter jet over the black sea. The Russian Su-27 damaged the propellor of the American MQ-9 Reaper drone, after flying in close proximity over it, and forced it down. Meanwhile, the Ukraine war is still ongoing and there is still no end in sight, rather there is a risk of the war escalating.Defense Analyst: ""There's A Pretty Good Long-Term Setup""On February 13 Cowen's defense and aerospace analyst, Roman Schweizer appeared in an interview on CNBC and to discuss the geopolitical situation and his view on the defense sector and defense stocks. ""This is a very peculiar period in time"", said Schweizer as he talked about the recent airborne objects shot down in North America. Schweizer thinks that unidentified objects flying at such high altitude can pose risk to commercial air travel. Here are some comments from Roman Schweizer about the U.S. defense budget, potential budget cuts, and defense stocks:""I'd say that the group (defense stocks) has underperformed, since the GOP (Republicans) kinda came out with wanting those what would be potentially 10% spending cuts. Really, when you look at the backlog in spending, 2 years ago the budget was up 7%, last year up 10%. We estimate there's about $37 billion in funds for Ukraine that haven't been put on contract for some of the large defense primes. So the pump is primed and as soon as we get into some of the budgetary details, if any of that overhang lifts, it certainly is gonna bode well for the companies.""Roman Schweizer is positive on the defense sector and sees it driving outperformance. Schweizer thinks the consensus is that the Ukraine war is a ""multi-year conflict"" and defense spending is going up in not just the U.S., but also in Japan and Europe. Schweizer also noted that the supply-chain issues and labor shortages due to COVID-19 are also fading away and the defense sector is ""starting to operate better"". Finally, Roman Schweizer said that he thinks ""there's a pretty good long-term setup"" for defense stocks.Story continuesAs the Ukraine war enters its second year, geopolitical risk is rising and defense spending is going up with it. On March 13, the U.S. Department of Defense released the proposed defense budget for fiscal 2024. The Biden-Harris Administration has submitted a request to Congress to increase the defense budget for fiscal 2024 to $842 billion, up $26 billion from fiscal 2023.Amid rising geopolitical tensions, the outlook for the defense sector is starting to look attractive. As of March 21, the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (BATS:ITA) has gained 1.55% year to date, and has gone up by 16.65% over the past 6 months.

BellThank you, John, and welcome, and thank you, everyone, for joining our year-end 2022 earnings conference call. 2022 was an exciting and pivotal year for Terran Orbital. In March, we became a publicly traded company and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LLAP, Live Long And Prosper. We've built backlog capacity and revenues throughout 2022. We are well on our way to achieving the vision of industrializing small space satellite production. We made extraordinary progress in a very short time.Today, I am thrilled to review the highlights from 2022 and provide a business update, including the company's record $2.4 billion contract from Rivada Space Networks, which we announced last month. Gary will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we're happy to take all your questions. Starting with a recap of Terran Orbital's achievements from 2022. In March, our company became public via a merger with Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp during challenging capital market conditions. Since then, our revenue has grown by 130% year-over-year to $94.2 million. Our backlog rose a similar percentage over the last 12 months from under $74 million to over $170 million as of December 31st. Our backlog includes over 60 satellites in various stages of completion, which we expect to deliver in the coming quarters. Over the last year, escalating geopolitical tensions and new space technology advances drove unprecedented and urgent demand for low earth orbit satellite solutions beyond even our earlier expectations. Our team has moved decisively and strategically to expand and vertically integrate our production facilities. I am delighted to report to you that our strategy is paying off. We delivered a record 19 satellites in 2022. Our investments in facilities, workforce and automation are creating an industry-leading production base in Irvine, California facilities. And in October 2022, we were thrilled to complete a new $100 million investment and extension of our strategic cooperation agreement to the year 2035 with our partner, Lockheed Martin. Our steady execution was demonstrated by our early delivery of the 10 satellites to Lockheed Martin in support of the space development agencies space development agencies Transport Layer Tranche 0.I couldn't be proud -- I couldn't be any more prouder of our Terran Orbital team's performance and delivering this important customer commitment. As discussed on every earnings call since our listing, meeting our commitments to Lockheed Martin, the Space Development Agency and our nation's war fighters on this critical program was a top goal for our team in 2022 and continues into 2023. I thank the entire production program and engineering teams for working hard to accomplish this goal and serve our customers' missions which we believe differentiates our performance relative to our competitors.As an established small satellite manufacturer with a first-mover advantage, we are expanding our competitive mode. Accordingly, we are landing bigger and even record shattering new contracts. For example, the Space Development Agency has awarded the Lockheed Martin Terran Orbital team, 2 successive tranches of the SDA's Transport Layer. The first award was for 10 satellites, which was awarded in early 2020, which we just completed. The second Tranche 1 award is for 42 satellites and was awarded just 12 months ago.We are executing on this Tranche and expect to begin deliveries later this year. We expect the Space Development Agency to award the Transport Layer Tranche 2 contracts later this year as well. And just last month, we received our largest contract ever. We were awarded a $2.4 billion contract to deliver 300 satellites and ground support to Rivada Space Networks. Rivada also has the option to purchase an additional 300 satellites as well. This advanced constellation will utilize the most advanced production -- advanced base technologies available to a low orbit proliferated constellation and provide cyber-secure communications and data services for the protection of the U.S. and its allies in Europe.Terran Orbital offered Rivada both manufacturing have to meet the critical mission and regulatory time-stones and a more capable satellite design and architecture to provide mission assurance. To solidify our leadership position in small satellite manufacturing and support diverse customers such as the space development agency, Rivada and others, we are pleased to announce further progress in expanding our capacity. Today, we are in the commissioning phase of our previously announced new facility in Irvine, California. This facility adds 60,000 square feet of manufacturing space and once fully ramped is expected to support the buildup up to 250 satellites per year. In addition, we are thrilled to announce today our next capacity expansion step. An incremental 94,000 square feet of leased manufacturing and assembly space also in Irvine, California. Importantly, this new facility, which has already begun construction, we'll have 36-foot high bay assembly space to accommodate the complete assembly and integration of larger size satellites along with their payloads. We are planning to transition all satellite assembly to this new facility and dedicate our existing facilities to the production of components and modules that will comprise our satellites.This optimization will enhance the efficiency and capacity of our entire production system. When fully ramped, this addition has the potential to raise our satellite capacity to multiples of our prior 250 per year target. We have a formal -- we will have a formal groundbreaking ceremony in May of this year and expect the facility to begin commissioning in 2024. Let's take a moment and talk about our outlook. As we look to the year ahead, we remain focused on continuing to convert our $14 billion pipeline of opportunities into firm contracts, scaling our capacity and executing our government -- customer commitments. Given the potential material impact of our contract with Rivada and other opportunities on our 2023 financial performance, we do not intend to provide 2023 guidance until the first phase of the Rivada program has commenced and progressed sufficiently to permit us to have a good sense of our projected results. We expect progress on this program to accelerate throughout 2023 and 2024 with deliveries concentrated in 2025 and 2026. As a reminder, these affordable low earth orbit satellites are designed for replacement every [few] years with the potential for recurring revenue stream as they need to continuously be replaced as do all low earth orbit satellites.Additionally, we expect to begin delivering SDA Transport Layer Tranche 1 satellites in 2023. The SDA has indicated they plan to run their procurements for new tranches of satellites every 2 years. They have announced multiple planned procurements over the next year, which we intend to participate. We are pleased that our on-time delivery and support of the early SDA mission positions us well for future awards. SDA program priorities this year and next include Tranche 2 of the Transport Layer, T2DES demonstration and experimentation and the Tranche 2 of the SDA's tracking layer represent nearly 300 additional satellites.We are proud of our team's achievements in 2022 and excited for the year ahead. A highlighted year was just last week when Terran Orbital's long legacy and satellites was recognized by the -- one of our earliest PropCube satellite, which is now on permanent display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. We highly encourage you to go see our success of the museum and thrilled to have it displayed them in perpetuity. Now I will hand the meeting over to Gary to review our financial performance and for the year-end 2022. Gary?Gary A. HobartThank you, Marc. And good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report our strong finish to the year resulted in revenue of $31.9 million for the fourth quarter a 197% increase over the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to our continued support of the SDA's Transport Layer, inclusive of the completion and delivery of 10 satellites to Lockheed Martin for the Tranche 0 program and continued progress made in satisfying other customer contracts.Full year 2022 revenues were $94.2 million, a 130% increase over the prior year. Overall, we are actively executing on our growth initiatives in order to position ourselves to be awarded large constellation contracts with recurring revenue opportunities. As a reminder, we recognize revenue on most of our programs on a percentage of completion basis and changes to our estimated cost at completion for a program or EAC will generally result in a cumulative impact on program revenues and margins in the period in which we make an EAC adjustment. During 2022, adjustments to our EACs reduced revenues by an estimated $7 million.Gross profit was negative $10.8 million for the fourth quarter and negative $17.3 million for the year in 2022 compared to $0.7 million and $7 million for the fourth quarter and full year in 2021. Excluding share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales, adjusted gross profit was negative $7.3 million for the fourth quarter and negative $2.2 million for the full year in 2022. This compares with $1.7 million and $9.5 million in the same periods in the prior year. EAC adjustments negatively impacted gross profit and adjusted gross profit by an estimated $18.3 million in 2022. This includes approximately $7 million from revenue previously noted and approximately $11.3 million from cost of sales. A large portion of these adjustments relate to programs that involve prototypes in early phases of potentially large customer missions. During 2022, we focused on delivering quality satellite solutions on tight time frames often involving technical design and supply chain challenges.While EAC adjustments are possible in the future, I'm pleased to say that most of the drivers of the 2022 EAC adjustments relate to programs that are substantially complete at this point. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $13.1 million in the same period in the prior year and $111.9 million for the full year of 2022 compared to $43.7 million for the full year of 2021. The increase for the full year was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense as a result of the Tailwind Two merger, an increase in research and development expense, increases in salaries and wages, facility costs related to capacity expansions and other operating costs, partially offset by a decrease in accounting and legal fees.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company abandoned plans to invest in a company-owned constellation of Earth observation satellites. As a result, we recorded a loss on impairment of $22.4 million related to costs previously capitalized as construction-in-progress associated with the development and construction of those initial satellites.Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $33.0 million compared to a net loss of $40.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Our net loss for the year was $164 million compared to a net loss of $139 million in the prior year. In addition to the items discussed earlier, the increase in net loss was driven by higher interest expense recorded in 2022, partially offset by a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and a decrease in the fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities in 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was negative $26.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This compares to a negative $11.3 million in the same period for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $69.5 million for 2022 compared with negative $26.1 million in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA for the year was primarily due to a decrease in adjusted gross profit and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to salaries and wages, research and development and other operating costs.Our backlog at the end of the year was approximately $170.8 million, and this does not include any contribution from the Rivada contract award announced in February. Capital expenditures for the year 2022 were $22.5 million. Finally, December 31, 2022, we had approximately $93.6 million of cash on hand and approximately $302 million in gross debt obligations. I will now turn the call back over to Marc.Marc H. BellThank you, Gary. And thank you, everyone, on the call for your continued support of Terran Orbital. I now look forward to taking your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Firstly, we've got Austin Moeller from Canaccord on the line. Please go ahead.Austin Nathan MoellerSo I just have a question here on the fiscal year '23 budget. So Congress added an incremental $500 million to the Space Development Agency's budget for 2023. So how do you see this as benefiting Terran Orbital going into a bid on the Tranche 2 of Tracking and Transport Layer along with other planned constellations like the Terran's Layer?Marc H. BellThe fiscal 2024 request continues to aggressively integrate Space Force into the fabric of National and International Security by collaborating across the Department of Defense and agency commercial industry, our allies and our partners. With the request of $26.1 billion, which is 8% of the investment budget request or for perspective, this is 181% higher than the $9.3 billion requested 5 years ago, which represented just less than 4% of the budget, we see this moving in a very positive direction for us.We see the FDA specifically approaching almost $3 billion now of total funding and growing rapidly as Congress gets more and more comfortable with their mission and as they prove results that they're able to deliver satellites quickly on time and on budget.Austin Nathan MoellerGreat answer. And then just a follow-up, this is probably a question for Gary, but -- do we see improvements in the pipeline on materials and labor costs? And is the time line to be EBITDA and free cash flow positive? Is that more would we think maybe in 2024 now?Gary A. HobartYes. So we are seeing improvements. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, a lot of the programs we've been working on are prototypes and early versions of bigger missions, and so as we have those programs are retired and we're building and scaling up with bigger programs, our ability to really leverage and scale and have economies of scale are starting to manifest themselves. I think that's going to play out over the next several quarters.Our general update with regard to your question about EBITDA continues to be that we have a reference to in our debt covenants a requirement to be EBITDA breakeven or positive by LTM June of 2024.OperatorOkay. Next, we have a question from Mike Crawford from B. Riley.Michael Roy CrawfordMarc, what do you expect to show in your backlog to know at the end of Q1 for the $2.4 billion Rivada contract?Gary A. HobartMike, we are still evaluating how we want to present the Rivada contract. For now, what you're seeing in this press release and in the 10-K is going to be just a separate reference to the Rivada contract, and we will make determinations as we finish the March quarter on how properly to approach that in terms of backlog of the overall presentation. For now, we're just separately present it to you guys so you can see it separate from our year-end backlog.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. Let me try differently. So well, first, we find intriguing that Rivada appears to have spectrum rights that have priority over Starlink. But what can you tell us about your understanding of approvals that Rivada needs both to start launching its satellites and also regarding the funding that has to pay you to build these at least these first 300 satellites are a portion thereof?Marc H. BellSure. So I can't comment on Rivada's business specifically that's a customer's job to do that. I can tell you about what we know about the ITU process. Rivada is entitled to a waiver of the deployment of 10% of the constellation against the deadline this year. The Radio Regulations Board, which consists of 12 elected ITU exerts can grant us. The regulator from the country where Rivada filed its orbital positions, which is the Offices of Communications for the principality of (inaudible) submitted all the necessary documentation to the Radio Regulations Bureau on time. Rivada believes that this submission contains full and clear evidence as requested in the relevant procedure.Rivada submitted evidence in time to receive a positive decision as early as possible as -- in March, it will be the end of March, but understands this framework allows for actions to be taken at the July RRB meeting instead. The German letter did not argue against granting the waiver. It merely asks that the RRB uses maximum time foreseen until June and a considerable reading of the process will be applied. And as far as funding goes, they have given our attorneys comfort on where they are in the funding process. And they have to get their ITU stuff finished and otherwise, I can't tell you they did make our first payment to us already.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. Excellent. And then just one final question is regarding your new Irvine expansion. So you also have the new high-bay facility right next to your existing components factory, but that also will just be for higher -- bigger size components that then you would move to Irvine, is that the new plan?Marc H. BellThe plan is to take what we call Barranca which is the original facility and we're going to attach it to the building next door, which is 50 Tech, which was -- which is our new facility coming online April 1. Those 2 buildings will do all of our module all -- all our module and component manufacturing, development and testing. All the assembly will move down the street to this new building. And that will be -- that would just be for assembly and Tyvak and final testing. And so -- but it's the 50 tech building with the high bay you're referring to is 25-foot high bay. The new building is 36 for Toll High Bay, allowing us to do significantly larger size satellites. We're seeing satellite buses get larger and larger. Even though we invented the CubeSat over a decade ago, we're seeing the requests -- people are going in the opposite direction. Everybody wants smaller and now people want larger. We've seen it go. We're now building -- I think we have a single satellite in-house down that's 800 kilograms. So we're seeing things get larger and larger request because we want more power, but we've also are learning that responsive space and the Go Fast model is what is more important than price and more important than anything else is getting it quickly. And so we're seeing incredible interest and -- us being able to deliver stocking buses and reducing down our cycle to do buses.But we're also looking to expand into payloads and to go ahead and have payloads that will be stocking payloads as well. So instead of right now having a 2-year cycle to design, build and deliver a satellite we want to shorten that up dramatically. And we have to -- especially coming out of satellite 2023, the conference in D.C., overwhelmingly, customers prefer speed to price. It was a very interesting conversation. And so with all the robotics that we're putting in, speed is something that we will sell at and price is how it's where we're going to go make our margin and become profitable.OperatorNext, we have a question from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel.Erik Peter RasmussenYes. Maybe just staying with the Irvine expansion. It seems like you're working on bringing up capacity to 250 satellites throughout the year. When do you expect to be at that run rate and is there additional capital needed to get there?Marc H. BellI expect to be at that run rate in the next 60 days in terms of capacity. The new facility is coming online April 1. We'll go through some testing to make sure everything is working as planned. But over -- by the end of Q2, that facility will be humming along. And that bring -- basically, we look at is 20 satellites a month is what we're able to produce, give or take. That's how we view these things. So we do -- we can do 10 a month now. We learn that in Q1, we can do 20 a month with the new facility and the facility that we're just constructing now dramatically increases that because it is a space purely designed for assembly nothing else.Erik Peter RasmussenSo would you say then -- you said you mentioned multiples of that. And so at some point, you're looking at 500, 750, or 1,000...Marc H. BellIt depends on the size of the satellite. It's all size dependent, but we haven't released the numbers yet. We will as we get further down this year, where we'll be. And just to preface, we will continue to -- we always have to hire ahead and we have to build ahead of programs that we are getting. So Rivada was a great -- people look at our pipeline and we talk about a $14 billion pipeline. And everyone was like, wow, that's just a crazy big number.But the reality is we just converted $2.4 billion of that pipeline. And that shows that our pipeline is quite real and quite active. And so we try -- we have to build ahead of programs and we have to hire people ahead of programs. So I would expect for our -- people to see that we will be making later this year, other announcements in terms of other new facilities that will be coming online over the next couple of years.Erik Peter RasmussenGot it. And then maybe just my follow-up. You delivered on time, the 10 satellites by year-end to support the T0TL program. And it seems like you're now transitioning to build the next tranches of 42 satellites. Can you just remind us, though, the timing of delivery for these satellites, what are the milestones you guys are targeting? And then maybe just give a little more color on how you think you're positioned for the other tranches that will be awarded by the SDA.Marc H. BellSure. I can tell you, we have to have all the satellites delivered by Q1 of 2024, and we are well on our way as we've already begun manufacturing, and as far as how we do with the SDA, we believe we've proven ourselves to the SDA. They said those who deliver will continue to win, I think, was the quote. And we will start to -- obviously, we start delivering Tranche 1 in 2023. But they said those who deliver will continue to win, and we are delivering.We're doing everything we said we're going to do and we will continue to do that. And I will do it at a price that makes sense. So we feel like we're in a pretty good -- it's obviously a very competitive bid. There were, I think, 17 people who bid on Tranche 1. So we expect to have a lot of bidders. But we continue to prove ourselves, and that means something.OperatorNext, we have a question from Elizabeth Grenfell from Bank of America.Elizabeth Carolyn GrenfellDid you give any color on what you expect revenue growth to be this year or CapEx associated with this facility expansions? Or any additional color in terms of just general modeling for the year.Marc H. BellElizabeth. In general, what we are doing is not providing guidance, just given the magnitude of the award -- Rivada. Away from Rivada, we've said in the past, we're looking to double our revenue as a general matter each of the coming years. And I would still look to that as a principal guidance, if you will. But we're really not guiding until we have more color on not only Rivada but other pipeline conversions that we're in the middle of doing.Elizabeth Carolyn GrenfellOkay. And what -- can you give us maybe start an idea around the cadence of how you expect Rivada to come in and how we should think about that?Marc H. BellWe are waiting for Rivada to -- they've got to get -- they have to get their ITU license finished and then everything goes full speed ahead. So one more step to do and then we're good to go.Elizabeth Carolyn GrenfellOkay. All right. And what about CapEx associated with these facility expansion? And how should we think about that? And at what point is it a little bit of putting the cart before the horse in the expansion?Marc H. BellWe always -- in our business, we always have to put the cart before the horse because if the horse shows up and has no place to go, then we're in deep trouble. So because you're always building -- everybody has an 18- to 24-month horizon, right? And we know what programs we believe we're going to be winning, and we have pretty good insight in our T1 rate of what we think we're going to get, and so we're not building for the sake of building. We knew, for example, we're going to be -- we did know.We had a high degree of confidence we were going to win T1. So we went ahead and we started building an addition on to 60,000 square feet because we knew our existing facility wasn't big enough to do T1. And we won T1, and now we have no space to build T1, we now have -- we had a good feeling that we were going to be winning something like Rivada. So we went ahead and we leased -- we signed a lease earlier this year to go begin building another facility that gives us the space to build a Rivada. Now as -- so if you look at us, as we sign more leases for more space and assembly space manufacturing space, that should be a good indicator to the market that we expect to be getting more customers in-house. And one other thing I'd like to add is in building these facilities, there's a very long lead time for a lot of specialized equipment that goes into these things. So we have -- so some of the stuff takes as much as 48 weeks to get. And so -- but when we get a program, they want it delivered on time. And we can't say we got to wait 48 weeks to get equipment. So it is -- we're not a capital-intensive business. We're a technology-intensive business. But we've made massive strides forward. I mean we'll be opening -- we just opened up a 3D printing facility. We are opening up in about a month, our printed circuit board assembly facility. We have -- we will be opening also in about a month our own testing facility with our own Tyvak chambers that can fit in entire satellite and their own [shaker tables] so we are taking a lot of the stuff we used to send outside bringing it inside going back to if you control your supply chain, you control your destiny.And we are vertically integrating, so we control our supply chain. So we don't have supply chain issues down the road like a lot of other people are having. This is one of the keys to our success.OperatorOkay. And next, we have a question from Greg Konrad from Jefferies.Gregory Arnold KonradJust to start, I appreciate that you're not giving guidance, but you called out you delivered 19 satellites in 2022, and it seems like maybe majority of Tranche 2 or sorry, Tranche 1 delivered in 2023. How many satellites do you plan to deliver in 2023?Marc H. BellYou answer that Gary?Gary A. HobartGreg, this may help at least guide you a little bit. The backlog at the end of the year is about $171 million. And in that backlog, there are a little over 60 satellites that are in various stages of construction. And generally speaking, our backlog converts inside of 2 years from the date of order. So while we're not guiding precisely to when that backlog will be converted or those satellites are delivered -- it's going to be closer to inside of 2 years. And so you could probably start modeling around using those as at least a reference point. And then Marc had mentioned earlier that the 42 satellites for Tranche 1 are due before the end of the first quarter of '24. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then just on the $14 billion pipeline, I mean you called out the Rivada award. If you think about just the breakdown, how much of that is in these larger chunky awards versus maybe smaller awards. Just thinking about catalysts as some of that pipeline converts?Marc H. BellThe biggest chunk of the pipeline is the $6 billion NASA Rapid Rewards contract IV. So that is where NASA can call us up and order satellites off that contract. We haven't -- we just met and when asked the other day, we haven't seen a lot of that. But Rivada really demonstrates the size of the things that we are spending our time going after. We are whale hunting and it is working. We're trying to -- we're spending a lot less time with people who are trying to build 1 satellite that we do -- do that. But we are spending all bulgur time with people who want to build hundreds of satellites.And what Rivada did for us as a business is it gave us a -- give us credibility in the marketplace that we can build a large satellite. So we spent the past week meeting with multiple constellation opportunities, the size of Rivada some smaller, some larger. But it was an incredibly -- people are viewing us now very differently, very credibly both around -- both within the DoD and in the commercial marketplace. And we're seeing a lot of interest now from foreign companies and foreign governments that we didn't see before. It's really been a huge transformation. I mean we have -- if you look at our pipeline, you have 125 different -- positive different opportunities with over 3,700 satellites kicking around in there. And with the new facility we just announced today, that gives us a huge advantage and with all the automation we're doing. And keep in mind, we make 85% of our components in-house. Most of our competitors buy components and lots of other manufacturers. And we all know when you buy components from 20 different manufacturers and put them all together, they work perfectly every time. It doesn't work like that. And that's one of the reasons all of our stuff is plug and play. They're all designed to work with each other. So -- and most of our stuff is flight proven at this point, which gives us also a huge advantage.And you have a lot of foreign entries coming into the United States. People like Airbus, people like LeoStella a lot of foreigners coming in. But the DoD is getting -- the Congress has gained to a point that they want to create jobs here in the U.S., and we shouldn't be suspending taxpayer dollars on defense programs built by foreigners and that is becoming a bigger, bigger topic up on the hill. And we expect that over the next year to have some real impact on our business as we are made in the U.S.A.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then just last one, just a 2-part question on cash. I might have missed it, but in terms of CapEx for 2023 and given expansion plans, I mean does CapEx kind of peak in 2023 or 2024 and kind of tied to that, you actually had really good working capital in 2022. Just given the upcoming contracts, would you expect that kind of carry into 2023 and just in terms of being positive on working capital.Gary A. HobartYes. So 2 parts to that question. On CapEx, as we've now ceased pursuing the self-funded constellation that will reduce to 0 that type of spend on CapEx. Predominantly CapEx will be a combination of facility and equipment expansion both in Irvine this year. And then the new facility this year and next. Right now, we haven't fully scoped that, but think about the 2 facilities is roughly a number that's maybe $10 million all in. It could be more, depending on how exclusive we get for each facility.We spent a little bit of that already for the existing Irvine expansion. I would also say maybe that there's a maintenance CapEx or an IT spend that's it anywhere from $5 million, maybe as high as $10 million, depending on how we think about equipment so right now, generically speaking, I'm looking at a CapEx profile that's anywhere from plus or minus $15 million maybe less, maybe more, depending on how accelerated we are on bringing on this additional facility in Irvine as well as how we think about the equipment that we're adding and testing capabilities.Regarding working capital, we do have fairly significant swings in working capital. You saw that a little bit throughout last year. We had positive working capital swings and pretty chunky working capital swings. A part of that is, quite frankly, the teething of growing when we had revenue growth in the fourth quarter, almost 200%. The working capital swings can be quite dramatic. And so part of how we think about our cash flows is factoring in working capital. And it's one of the reasons why we're looking at our liquidity constantly and thinking about how to manage that, both our growth and also our liquidity profile.OperatorNext, we have a question from Robert Springan from Melius.Robert Michael SpingarnGood morning, everyone. Marc, just all the color you've given us, net-net, how would you say the market has changed from a demand perspective? Is the economy changes and maybe marginalized players are moving away. So how has the demand changed? And then how is the supply chain? Are you seeing any of your competition to exit the market?Marc H. BellSure. So let's bring this to cope pieces. So on the market side, the NDAA is the only thing Democrats or Republicans always agree on its recession proof, it's interest rate proof. It will be for [51] years. It's always been a near and unanimous. We don't see us cutting our defense budget anytime soon with everything going on in Ukraine and China. We just don't see that as a reality. We always see our biggest threat to our business is world peace. We don't see that happening anytime soon as well. What we do see in the commercial side is people are seeing that commercially owned satellite constellations are now economically viable. When they were building $1 billion satellites in geosynchronous orbit, they weren't economically viable. When you're building $1 million satellites in low-earth orbit, they become -- business applications become economically viable, whether it's 5G, Internet of Things, all sorts of other things.There are things we can do for -- the things we can do to them to make the -- world has changed that has made it more productive for companies to do business. On the supply chain side, by continuing to build things in-house, we are seeing less and less supply chain issues. We are seeing a lot of our competitors and our competitors per se. A lot of -- a lot of the new space stacks we see them continuing to get into trouble. You saw what happened to Virgin Orbit. All these guys are building it and hope they will come. In our case, we don't build something unless they come to us first. So we have a very different business model, but we're just lumped into a bad neighborhood. And unfortunately, our stock doesn't represent that.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then and Gary, you talked about a lot of positives and negatives just with regard to the numbers. So when you put all that together, how should we expect free cash burn to continue as we go through the year. I know you're not guiding, but what should the trend be between the facility expansions against the prototyping, winding down and so on?Gary A. HobartYes, Rob, thanks for the question. The -- it's a little bit difficult to say in addition to not providing guidance, but I can point to the near-term history that we could see swings particularly in working capital that impact our liquidity or at least our free cash flow to tune as much as $25 million to $30 million in any one quarter to be a little bit higher than that, could be a little bit lower, particularly if Rivada onboards on the time frame we're thinking about.So it is a fairly big swing that we are managing and that one, working capital is probably the biggest one as well as overall the timing of new awards and the execution of those awards. That has a very dramatic impact generally positive with new awards as we bring them on. And so it makes it difficult to guide, but it also is kind of a function of where we're at in terms of growth and use of liquidity, and so it's -- let me pause there because it's really difficult to give much more guidance than that.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And just a housekeeping question. Where are you on the B. Riley facility?Gary A. HobartSo the B. Riley facility is still open and available to us. We have available to us a lesser of about $98 million of proceeds or the sale of about 27 million shares. So we've barely tapped it last year.OperatorNext, we have a question from Josh Sullivan from Benchmark.Joshua Ward SullivanAs far as the EACs, any areas or aspects of the contracts to call out for lessons learned? I think you mentioned it might have been related to some legacy programs.Marc H. BellI mean I'd be more specific.Joshua Ward SullivanSo I mean just a point forward, should we think about -- you mentioned there were part of legacy programs. So should we anticipate it going forward in a better position here.Gary A. HobartSo like as I mentioned, it's possible that we have additional EAC adjustments in the future. We finished the year with our estimates in our EAC based on what we knew. So -- what I will just reiterate is a large portion of the EAC adjustments we saw throughout 2022 were on programs that we are substantially completed on and so those programs tend to be more prototype and early phase programs where, quite frankly, technical challenges, supply chain challenges, running additional shifts, all those things contributed to additional costs and also just, quite frankly, trying to move things and accelerate the speed to get things out the door. So there's a little bit of key thing here as we bring onboard things. But those one-off programs tend to be the ones where you have $1 million or $2 million impact and if you have a couple of programs like that, it adds up each quarter, and that's what we're seeing. What we can see going forward is a lot of our programs now are the bigger, more scaled programs where if we do have an impact -- the size impact relative to the overall program is much more muted. So we have -- we're encouraged by where we are at the beginning of the year. And -- but a lot of the EAC adjustments, we hopefully are in our rearview mirror, but there is possible we have some in the future.Marc H. BellYes. I mean, 36 months ago, we were building satellites to could hold in the palm of your hand. Today, we're holding things that need just go into a truck. But the sizing seems to be stabilizing and the 350 to 500-kilogram range is where most people are seem to be stabilizing. But there was a learning curve to getting to that point. But now -- everyone with the size of stabilizing, we'll see less [NREs] going forward than we have in the past.Joshua Ward SullivanGot it. And then maybe just one on the announcement on Monday with cognitive space. Can you talk about the dual use asset there? Is that going to be owned by you? And does it include any SAAR?Marc H. BellTerran Orbital is now scheduling an on-orbit asset using cognitive spaces Sentience software platform. We expect this partnership to help drive down costs of our internal operations, as well as our customers grow the larger constellation is easier. I can't comment as to what we're using it for. That's all I could say at this point.OperatorNext, we have a question from (inaudible). Please go ahead.Unidentified AnalystI do have a question regarding the $14 billion pipeline that I would assume doesn't include a $2.4 million of Rivada. Can you give us any color on the composition in the stage of that pipeline? And what are you expecting of that to convert in 2023 and what would that go into 2024?Marc H. BellSure. Well, it was a $16.4 billion pipeline. That's now a $14 billion pipeline, but there are about 125 programs in there that should make up about 3,700 satellites. The biggest of that $14 billion is a $6 billion NASA Rapid Rewards contract. And after that, you've got some very, very large programs and some smaller programs as well.OperatorWe have a question from [James Burn].Unidentified ShareholderI'm not sure really if I have any kind of a question, but just an observation. I've been a finance guy my whole career. And when I see the kinds of losses I see you folks racked up last year, I just get very concerned that there might be fundamental problems in the manufacturing operations that are hard to see. And so it's just -- I have quite a few shares of your stock. I think I want to be acquiring more, but I hope you have a very strong cost accounting person on your staff so that when you ship a satellite, they can say immediately, this is how we did on that satellite or this group of satellites and -- so that's my only comment. The other thing I see is -- I've also been involved in a number of start-ups and unfortunately for me, not one of them has succeeded. And one thing I see very much is that people are very focused on trying to get more and more sales. You guys got $2.4 billion worth of a contract focus on that, never mind trying to get any more business, you need to succeed on this $2.4 billion or you're going to get overwhelmed -- and I see people run out of cash very quickly. And all of a sudden, there's a problem and then the next thing you know the company is gone. So I'm putting a lot of faith in you guys. I've got a lot of shares. I'm going to acquire some more, but I'm just giving you some of my thoughts and my experience in the future, you've got a huge contract and make sure you succeed with what's in front of you and don't be so focused on trying to get more.Marc H. BellSo we appreciate very much your comments. We are -- so between my business partner, Dan stated and I we've built 7 unicorns, this will be our eighth. We've taken 17 companies public successfully. We are old experienced management team. We understand that we've had losses and part of that is we are hiring ahead of programs.We are 100% committed to Rivada and getting it out the door on time and profitably. And as we are to all the programs we have going forward. But we needed to build up scale because we knew what programs we would be. We knew that we would be getting some big programs and you have to hire a head at scale. But you will start to see the financials improve going into 2024 because obviously gain to EBITDA positive and free cash flow positive is enormously important to all of us. And so -- but we had to spend a lot of money to get where we are today, but we totally understand your concerns. And trust me, Gary and myself and the rest of the management team are working to make sure they are in a great place. And thankfully, with a partner like Lockheed Martin, they have been very supportive of us and we've been keeping us enormously busy running 2 shifts a day, 7 days a week in our existing facility. And we will be with the new facilities, we will get to a more normal work cycle, which also will help to keep our cost down especially with all the robotics we're building. And as with any investor on the call, we invite people to come to see our facilities, see what we do. We're always welcome to have investors come take a tour.Operator(Operator Instructions) We have a question from [Dan Ramp] from (inaudible) Capital.Unidentified AnalystI wonder if you could speak to your cash needs and how that could change once the Rivada gets the IPO approval, is that a benefit to you guys? Or would that be your cash needs towards -- in other words, is there a possibility of getting a large upfront payment when this project kicks off, that could enumerate some of your cash needs.Marc H. BellYes. So with any commercial program, see, we don't give a lot of credit. We're cash in advance kind of people and God we trust, but all of them must pay cash. And so we want -- we -- most commercial contracts are pay in advance, then we work, paying advance then we were, it's like a law firm working off a retainer. We give very little credit unlike the Department of Defense, we give credit to, but they pay very, very quickly. So -- but we are -- on the commercial side, all of our commercial contracts are written to were very, very little cash upfront we have to spend.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And kind of a follow-up to that, regarding what you're seeing in the market now and the banking crisis, I think part of the reason you're seeing some pressure on the stocking before today, the last few days, we've seen this across the stock market is any companies that require cash have really been punished because of it (inaudible) comes in regional banks, et cetera. And I'm wondering if you have that on your radar and what kind of alternatives you may have in mind to be able to limit dilution if you do need develop and get that capital and in part of that as well, are there any concerns on your lawyers feel comfortable with the financing for Rivada, but if there is some sort of a crunch in the banking space, a further one, would that risk the funding coming into Rivada as far as you know?Marc H. BellWhile we are thrilled that we have Rivada, we don't count on any one contract. We continue to go out and just like we will be bidding on the new SDA programs coming up. We continue to bid on lots of things and we have a very high success rate in winning what we bid on. So we continue to bid. We're with Lockheed Martin. We've had a tremendously high success rate. And I think we have 11 Lockheed programs in-house right now. And we continue to be -- they continue to be a phenomenal partner and working together, so we don't -- we've done very well on the cash management side. We just raised $100 million last year from Lockheed. We feel pretty good about where we are and have no concerns at this point about our cash.OperatorWe currently have no further questions, so I'll hand it back over to the management team.Marc H. BellGreat. Well, on behalf of Gary Hobart and myself and the rest of the Terran Orbital management team and all of our employees, we thank you very much for your support and your continuing confidence in Terran Orbital. We appreciate everybody tuning in for today's call. And as always, we try to make ourselves as accessible as possible to the investing community.We're going to be at the Sidoti Conference this week on Wednesday and Thursday this week, for those of you who wish to attend, and we continue to make ourselves available. So feel free to reach out to us at ir@terranorbital.com, and we are happy to answer any and all questions and look forward to seeing you in another quarter. Thank you very much.OperatorThis concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

PHM has been riding on land acquisition strategies and focusing on entry-level buyers. Also, business expansion via community openings in various locations bodes well. Additionally, the company raised shareholders’ value with regular repurchases and dividend distribution.Shares of this leading homebuilder gained 21.1% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 14.1% growth. The upside can be attributed to a strong fourth-quarter 2022, where earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates and increased year over year in double digits.Home sales gross margin was up 200 basis points (bps) and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 bps year over year. The improvement in the past few quarters helped PulteGroup lower its debt-to-capital ratio to 18.7% and deliver a full year return on equity of 32.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, high inflation, supply chain woes and project delays are denting housing orders and backlog. Although demand has started improving as companies introduced various discounts and reduced prices to overcome the affordability issue, orders and backlog remain a major concern.Let’s delve deeper into the factors influencing this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Growth Driving FactorsLand Acquisition Strategy: PulteGroup’s land acquisition strategies aim at improving volumes, revenues and profitability on an annual basis. In 2022 and 2021, the company spent $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion on land acquisition and development, respectively. PulteGroup’s land strategy also emphasizes investing in shorter-lived, smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements, when possible, thereby mitigating market risk.PHM currently expects land spending to drop materially in 2023, thanks to the change in buyer demand. The company expects the land acquisition and development spend in 2023 to drop to approximately $3.3 billion. Of these, it estimates 65% will go toward the development of owned land positions. The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital given plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate inventory turns.First-Time/Entry-Level Buyers: PulteGroup remains focused on growing demand for entry-level homes, which aim at lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability. In view of these strategic efforts, the growing share of first-time buyers is encouraging. First-time buyers represented 36% of closings for the fourth quarter of 2022, along with 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adults. In fourth-quarter 2021, it comprised 33% first-timers, 42% move-ups and 25% active adults. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with its strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space. Rapid Community Openings: The company recently announced community openings in various locations. On Mar 16, it unveiled a new community in Louisville, The Trails at Belmond. On Mar 8, it introduced expansion in the Greenville market with three new construction communities within its Pulte Homes brand. The first community, Indigo Park, is in Easley and is likely to open this summer. The second community — Briarwood Reserve in Spartanburg — is set to open in late 2023. The last one, Alston Park in Greenville, is expected to open in early 2024.Driving Shareholder Value: PHM has been paying quarterly dividends for nearly four decades. It has been consistently focusing on sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a strong financial position. In December 2022, it announced a quarterly dividend hike of 7% to 16 cents per share. This is payable Jan 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 14, 2022.In 2022, PHM paid quarterly cash dividends of $143.1 million and $148.1 million in 2021. Also, it repurchased 24.2 million and 17.7 million shares in 2022 and 2021 for $1.1 billion and $897.3 million, respectively. On Jan 31, 2022, its Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. At the end of 2022, the company had $382.9 million remaining in authorization.Story continuesCauses of ConcernTepid Orders &amp; Backlog Numbers: Net new orders in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 41% from a year ago to 3,964 homes. The decrease in orders reflects several headwinds, like rising mortgage rates, lower affordability, lower consumer confidence and slowed demand. Also, net new orders in the quarter were impacted by a significant increase in cancellations. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 32%, much higher than the 11% in the year-ago period and 24% in the third quarter of 2022.Grim Outlook: Given the slowdown in overall housing activity, PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be within 5,400-5,700 homes in first-quarter 2023, indicating a decline from 6,039 homes delivered a year ago. It expects the ASP to be within $565,000-$575,000, indicating an increase of 12% from a year ago. PHM expects homebuilding gross margins to contract 200 bps to 27% for first-quarter 2023 from the year-ago period. The company anticipates SG&amp;A (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 10.5-11% versus 10.7% in the prior year. Tax rate in the first quarter of 2023 is likely to be 25%.PHM assumed its current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the headwind for the next several months. With 18,000 homes currently in production, it expects to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023, down from 29,111 units reported in 2022. Also, it plans to dramatically lower its land spend in 2023. It expects total land investment to be approximately $3.3 billion, including 65% of the investment in the development of owned land positions.Higher Inflation: Higher land and labor costs are threatening margins, as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability. Also, the shortage of input materials is raising commodity costs, thereby impacting the company’s results. Raw material inflation is eating into homebuilders’ margins.Although it has been navigating the challenges associated with supply shortages and land development well, these headwinds pose serious threats to the company’s margins. During fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company pointed out that other than lumber, it has been an inflationary market in almost every aspect and that this was pressurizing margins.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are NVR, Inc. NVR, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL.NVR: This Reston, VA-based homebuilder is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, all of which are primarily constructed on a pre-sold basis. To serve homebuilding customers, NVR operates a mortgage banking and title services business. A disciplined business model and focus on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risks have helped NVR. The lot acquisition strategy helps the company avoid financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. This strategy allows it to gain efficiencies and a competitive edge over its peers.NVR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. NVR has seen an upward estimate revision for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days to $394.77 per share from $357.51 per share.Taylor Morrison: This Scottsdale, AZ-based homebuilder’s ongoing operational enhancements, acquisition synergies and robust pricing power have more than offset the inflationary pressure and delays in some closings. The company’s well-balanced, diverse mix of portfolio and operating strategy is encouraging. TMHC has expanded its market footprint and product positioning in recent years through acquisitions and impressive organic growth, thereby serving a broad range of consumers in the entry-level, first-and-second move-up and resort lifestyle segments across the country. The success of these efforts has been driving growth for the company and enhancing its liquidity level, enabling it to take advantage of investment opportunities as the market evolves.TMHC currently holds a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has been upwardly revised to $6.46 per share from $5.47 per share over the past 30 days.Toll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, Toll Brothers is a leading builder of luxury homes. The company has been benefiting from its strategy of broadening its product lines, price points and geographies. Also, it has been gaining from the lack of competition in the luxury new home market, its build-to-order approach and a solid backlog.TOL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have increased to $8.66 per share from $7.87 per share over the past 30 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Baxter, which has a market value of $19 billion, had total debt of $16.6 billion as of the end of December.Private equity firms, including KKR &amp; Co and Carlyle Group, have also expressed interest in the Baxter business, the sources said. Other bidders could still emerge, they added.The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Baxter, Thermo Fisher and KKR declined to comment. Celltrion and Carlyle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Baxter said in January it was exploring alternatives for its biopharma solutions business and would also spin off its kidney care units.The Deerfield, Illinois-based company focuses on areas such as critical care, surgical products, nutrition and pharmaceutical equipment.Baxter's biopharma solutions unit supports drugmakers in the formulation, development and commercialization of drugs typically given by infusion or injection, such as biologics and vaccines.Thermo Fisher, one of the world's largest suppliers of scientific equipment, has been making acquisitions in recent years to expand its offerings in contract research and manufacturing, including a $5.2 billion purchase of Patheon NV in 2017 and a $17.4 billion takeover of PPD Inc in 2021.Celltrion, whose co-founder and chairman Seo Jung-jin is South Korea's richest person according to Forbes, is a biopharmaceutical company that also has a contract research and manufacturing arm.(Reporting by Anirban Sen and David Carnevali in New YorkAdditional reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group How Fast Is WEC Energy Group Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years WEC Energy Group grew its EPS by 7.5% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note WEC Energy Group achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$9.6b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of WEC Energy Group's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre WEC Energy Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of WEC Energy Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$43m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.2% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like WEC Energy Group, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.The CEO of WEC Energy Group only received US$5.0m in total compensation for the year ending December 2021. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does WEC Energy Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, WEC Energy Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for WEC Energy Group, but the pleasant picture gets better than that.

Here's the one powerful technique that made Grace Groner rich — and can change your life tooGrace Groner worked as a secretary for medical device giant Abbott Laboratories for 43 years. She lived in a tiny one-bedroom cottage, didn’t own a car and bought her clothes at rummage sales.So when she passed away in 2010 at the age of 100 and left her estate to her alma mater, Lake Forest College in Illinois, the story made headlines. ""Oh, my God,"" the school’s president said after finding out the amount, the Chicago Tribune reported.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsGroner built her wealth using a very simple strategy. While she was working at Abbott in 1935, she decided to purchase three shares of the company. At the time, they were trading at around $60 each, for a total investment of $180 — a fair amount of money back then, but far from an extravagant investment.She held on to those shares. When the stock split, she didn’t sell them. When the company paid dividends, she used the cash to buy more shares of Abbott.Fast forward decades later and that small $180 investment had grown to more than $7 million.The strategy for people who want to earn passive income from stocks is simple, but powerful: Find stocks that pay strong dividends, let them sit and reinvest the regular payouts.Of course, not all dividend stocks are the same. Here’s a look at three companies with long track records of paying reliable — and increasing — dividends.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola (KO) is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Story continuesAdd solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.More impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 3.1%.Johnson &amp; JohnsonWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Read more: Here's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?Not only does Johnson &amp; Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.The stock has been trending up for decades, all while returning an increasing amount of cash to shareholders. JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase last April and now yields 3.0%.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble (PG) has an even longer dividend growth track record than Coca-Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson: the company has raised its payout to shareholders for 66 consecutive years.That streak is a testament to its entrenched position in the consumer staples market. P&amp;G has a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent.These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. As a result, the company can deliver reliable dividends even in tough times.The latest dividend hike was announced in April 2022, when the board of directors approved a 5% increase to the quarterly payout to 91.33 cents per share. The stock currently yields 2.5%.What to read nextWhat do Ashton Kutcher and a Nobel Prize-winning economist have in common?

340,f3aa3aec-45ca-374e-97df-f55247514501,RSG,2023-03-23,Here's Why Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-republic-services-nyse-123537729.html,1679488537.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Republic Services (NYSE:RSG). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Republic Services How Quickly Is Republic Services Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Republic Services managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Republic Services achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to US$14b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Republic Services' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Republic Services Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Republic Services has a market capitalisation of US$41b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they hold US$48m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.1%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Story continuesWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Republic Services, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.Republic Services offered total compensation worth US$7.9m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Does Republic Services Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Republic Services is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Republic Services, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Even so, be aware that  Republic Services is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

She remembers times early in her career when she was the only woman in the room. That's why she co-founded the Merck Research Award, given annually by the Women Chemists Committee (WCC) of the American Chemical Society, to recognize and mentor talented women scientists in their third and fourth year of graduate school with a research focus in one or more chemistry-related disciplines.For Merck, it's a chance to build relationships with promising chemists and introduce them to the work the company does.""A key to attracting talent - especially diverse talent - is to build relationships early in people's careers so they become familiar with our science, our people and our values,"" said Ruck, an associate vice president in process research and development for Merck.For the awardees, it's a chance to present their research at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall National Meeting. They also receive a Merck mentor to prepare for their presentation at ACS and advise them on their career journey - an opportunity equally fulfilling for the mentors.""That level of interaction with established chemists sets the program apart,"" said Anisha Patel, a director in analytical research and development, and lead of the program for Merck. ""It's also a tremendous investment in diverse recruiting."" Merck ultimately recruited three of the 2022 winners for future employment at the company.Paying it forward for the next generationWhen Ruck co-founded the award in 2015 along with Ann Weber, a former Merck chemist, she wanted to inspire the next generation of women in chemistry and build a community of scientists to support each other. Fast forward, and the WCC Merck Research Award fosters advancement for eight graduate students in chemistry annually. Last year, approximately 120 students applied.One past honoree who's now a Merck colleague, Beryl Li, developed a long-term relationship with her mentor. ""After I won, we would meet regularly,"" said Li, a senior scientist at the company's South San Francisco Discovery Center.Story continues""My mentor was a significant factor in my decision to join Merck - and in my success at the company.""Beryl Li Senior scientistThose successes are also a reminder that every step forward matters. ""There is still plenty of work needed to advance women - and all underrepresented groups - in science,"" Ruck said.

348,33f5e725-4816-35f3-91c2-d436274130a3,MRK,2023-03-23,Merck (MRK) Stock Up 31.6% in a Year: What Awaits in 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-mrk-stock-31-6-102610492.html,1679307970,STORY,"['MRK', 'NVO']","[Merck MRK boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. The drug has played an instrumental role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Though Keytruda may be Merck’s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that the company is excessively dependent on the drug and should look for ways to diversify its product line-up.Keytruda’s sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches.The Kenilworth, NJ-based firm's stock has risen 31.6% in the past year compared with an increase of 0.1% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. The drug is presently approved to treat seven indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States. Merck expects over half of Keytruda’s growth to come from indications in early-stage (neoadjuvant/adjuvant) treatment settings in the United States through 2025 and to represent roughly 25% of total global Keytruda sales by that time.Merck is also working on different strategies to drive the long-term growth of Keytruda. These include innovative immuno-oncology combinations, including Keytruda with TIGIT, LAG3 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. In partnership with Moderna, Merck is developing a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine (V940/mRNA-4157) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of adjuvant melanoma.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima are also boosting Merck’s oncology sales.Please note that Merck markets Lynparza in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN.Story continuesAstraZeneca and Merck had formed the profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is being evaluated in combination with Keytruda in late-stage studies for lung cancer indications.In oncology, Merck expects more than 90 potential new indications by 2028, including Keytruda, Lynparza and Lenvima. Between 2025 and 2030, the company expects eight potential approvals.Beyond oncology, which is expected to drive stable growth into the next decade, Merck has important products in its portfolio, including the Gardasil vaccine to prevent HPV-related cancers. Sales of Gardasil vaccine grew 40% in 2021 and 22% in 2022. In 2023, MRK expects to drive strong growth of Gardasil, particularly in international markets, as global immunization levels continue to be low, which implies potential for significant growth.The company also expects Gardasil's long-term growth to benefit from increased supply as it is investing in expanding its manufacturing capacity. Merck expects Gardasil sales to potentially double by 2030 from the 2021 levelIn addition, its Animal Health business is a key contributor to its top-line growth as Merck is recording above-market growth, which is expected to continue in 2023.Merck does have its share of problems, like generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise. There are concerns about the firm’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade. Declining revenues from the oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio (molnupiravir), for COVID should also put pressure on the top line in 2023.Key diabetes medicines, Januvia and Janumet lost market exclusivity in the United States in January 2023. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and the European Union in September last year, while the additional exclusivity of Janumet expires in April 2023. Sales of the drugs are expected to decline significantly from 2023 onward due to generic erosion.Nonetheless, strong sales of key products like Keytruda and Gardasil, a significant contribution from the Animal Health franchise and positive pipeline/regulatory developments can keep the stock afloat in 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMerck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(The) (WMB) Down 5.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-wmb-down-153003122.html,1679499003,STORY,"['WMB', '^GSPC']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB). Shares have lost about 5.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Williams Companies, Inc. (The) due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Williams Q4 Earnings Beat EstimateThe Williams Companies reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. It also surpassed the year-ago period’s profit of 39 cents per share. The outperformance was due to lower costs and higher contributions from its two segments — Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico, and West.Meanwhile, in the quarter that ended Dec 31, Williams’ revenues of $2.9 billion underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.2 billion. It also came in below the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $3.3 billion. The underperformance could be attributed to decreased product sales.Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the quarter under review, indicating a 19.7% increase from the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.2 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter’s tally.Segmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: Comprising WMB’s massive Transco pipeline system and Northwest Pipeline, the segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $700 million, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, the growth of Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico was driven by the acquisition of NorTex, Transco's Leidy South project, and improved resilience to natural disasters.West: This segment focuses on the gathering and processing of assets in the Western region of the United States. It delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $326 million, 25.9% higher than $259 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The better outcomes were mainly due to higher net realized commodity-based rates and greater Haynesville gathering volumes comprising contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April.Northeast G&amp;P: The unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $464 million, up almost 1% from the prior-year quarter’s $459 million.The slight positive comparison was mainly because of Ohio Valley Midstream and gathering rate hikes. This was partly offset by lower Susquehanna volumes, higher operating and administrative costs, and lower net equity-investee contributions due to lower cost-of-service rates, lower volumes, and the impact of winter weather.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $149 million, up significantly from the prior-year quarter’s $11 million.This segment's performance improved on the back of steady commodity margins, which involved reducing inventory values to reflect lower market prices at the quarter’s end.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, total costs and expenses of $1.85 billion were reduced by almost 20% compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.32 billion.Williams’ total capital investment was $876 million, up from $371 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and long-term debt of $21.9 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of almost 61%.2023 GuidanceWMB anticipates its 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the $6.4-$6.8 billion range, and growth capital spending in the $1.4-$1.7 billion range. Williams also expects to achieve a leverage ratio midpoint of 3.65X.The company anticipates its maintenance capital expenditures between $750 million and $850 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Williams Companies, Inc. (The) has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

The range and fuel efficiency of the 737 MAX will reduce carbon emissions by 15% compared to the planes they are replacing, he said.""I believe this is a very high potential aircraft,"" Akasaka said.Reuters reported details of the deal on Wednesday, citing industry sources.The JAL order ensures a foothold for the MAX with Japan's flagship carrier as Boeing strives to undermine Airbus's lead in the narrowbody market.""One problem that has hobbled the (737 MAX) program is that despite good orders, there haven't been as many high profile users. This certainly helps a lot,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories.Although JAL predominantly operates Boeing planes, it delivered a shock to the aircraft industry in 2013 when it opted to buy Airbus's A350 widebody aircraft over the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which at the time was struggling to correct technical problems.While JAL's current fleet of 48 Dreamliners now dwarfs the 11 A350s owned by the carrier, the initial Airbus order raised questions about whether Boeing would continue to dominate the Japanese market.Those concerns were heightened by the 737 MAX crisis, which led All Nippon Airways (ANA) to delay finalizing an order for 20 MAXs first announced in January 2019. ANA and Boeing concluded the MAX deal in July.The Boeing 737-800 currently makes up the largest portion of JAL's narrowbody fleet, with the carrier owning 47 jets and leasing another 17 737s, according to JAL.However, Airbus has gained traction in Japan's narrowbody market, with ANA's low-cost Peach unit operating A320s and JAL's Jetstar Japan flying leased A320s.""It's a battle, keeping Japan,"" Aboulafia said.

This certainly helps a lot,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories.Although JAL predominantly operates Boeing planes, it delivered a shock to the aircraft industry in 2013 when it opted to buy Airbus's A350 widebody aircraft over the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which at the time was struggling to correct technical problems.While JAL's current fleet of 48 Dreamliners now dwarfs the 11 A350s owned by the carrier, the initial Airbus order raised questions about whether Boeing would continue to dominate the Japanese market.Those concerns were heightened by the 737 MAX crisis, which led All Nippon Airways (ANA) to delay finalizing an order for 20 MAXs first announced in January 2019. ANA and Boeing concluded the MAX deal in July.The Boeing 737-800 currently makes up the largest portion of JAL's narrowbody fleet, with the carrier owning 47 jets and leasing another 17 737s, according to JAL.Story continuesHowever, Airbus has gained traction in Japan's narrowbody market, with ANA's low-cost Peach unit operating A320s and JAL's Jetstar Japan flying leased A320s.""It's a battle, keeping Japan,"" Aboulafia said. Boeing ""seems to have scored a victory here.""(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington, Rocky Swift and Maki Shiraki in Tokyo. Editing by Chris Reese and Mark Potter)]"

Illumina is the only profitable, pure-play genomics tools company in existence. This commitment to excellence and successful execution includes profitable, double-digit revenue growth over the past decade. By adding Icahn's director nominees, who lack experience in, and knowledge of, the business and industry, Illumina risks jeopardizing the long-term success of its core franchise which is primed to achieve rich, long-term shareholder returns over the next several years and beyond.Illumina continues to advance its innovation roadmap in support of its long-term growth trajectory. Since the successful launch of NovaSeq™ X, Illumina's latest flagship high-throughput instrument, there has been unprecedented demand from both research and clinical customers, while the company delivered record NextSeq™ 1000 and 2000 mid-throughput sequencing platform shipments and orders in the fourth quarter of 2022. New product introductions such as NovaSeq™ X as well as upgrades across the rest of the portfolio, including Illumina Complete Long Reads and NovaSeq™ 6000Dx, are game-changing innovations that maintain the company's position as the leading innovator in sequencing and drive long-term sustainable shareholder value.Story continuesOver the last two decades, Illumina has maintained leadership in research and clinical genomics. It has built an installed base of more than 23,000 sequencing systems across more than 9,500 customers in 155 countries, as well as secured more than 8,800 patents for its technologies.While remaining committed to innovation, Illumina's management team also focuses on managing costs, including a restructuring in late 2022. Illumina produces strong gross margins and operating margins, while all other pure-play genomics tools companies generate operating losses. Illumina's share price has outpaced other pure-play genomics tools companies by 26 percentage points over the last two years.On March 14th during a CNBC appearance, Carl Icahn recognized the ""great company in Illumina, and in gene sequencing."" On this much, we agree. Illumina has created a unique and positive track record due to its experience identifying, nurturing, and bringing innovation to market. Illumina's world-leading innovation portfolio is the result of deep understanding of biology, the challenges of biological discovery and engineering requiring five to ten year science and technology investments. A short-term approach to managing innovation would not have created the multiple technologies that make NovaSeq™ X a world-leading product, or any other product in Illumina's portfolio.GRAIL has strong traction; Illumina is taking all steps to maximize GRAIL's valueGRAIL has tremendous long-term value creation potential and is a great example of Illumina's innovation strategy. As a transformative, clinically-validated technology based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and serving an underpenetrated $44-plus billion cancer screening market, GRAIL offers the only commercially available multi-cancer early detection test, Galleri™. The test has enjoyed the fastest first-year revenue ramp of any cancer screening test and generated $55 million of revenue in 2022, even ahead of anticipated commercial or government-based reimbursement. It is on track to deliver $90 – 110 million of revenue in 2023.To date, more than 60,000 Galleri™ tests have been ordered and have impacted the lives of patients who have had the opportunity to take this groundbreaking test. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has enrolled 140,000 participants in a study of the Galleri™ test. If the study continues to be successful, the NHS is expected to roll out the Galleri™ test to 1 million people in the UK beginning in 2024.Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to work through the legal and regulatory processes to maximize value for shareholders with respect to GRAIL, including defining the conditions and options of a potential divestiture. Illumina has challenged the European Commission's (EC) jurisdiction to review the GRAIL acquisition. The final decision is expected in late 2023 or early 2024. Winning a jurisdictional appeal eliminates any EC fine and gives the greatest optionality for Illumina to maximize value for shareholders. If Illumina loses the EU jurisdictional appeal, the company will follow the terms of the final divestiture order, expeditiously and in a manner that is in the best interests of its shareholders. The Board's ongoing management of the GRAIL process is carefully considered and informed by thorough analysis.Icahn does not contest that GRAIL represents a valuable asset to both Illumina's shareholders and global human health. Indeed, on CNBC on March 14th, he referred to GRAIL as Illumina's ""best equipment."" He also acknowledges he doesn't understand the regulatory process and has not offered any new ideas for a more rapid resolution for GRAIL. As for the EU regulatory process, he admits he's ""not a lawyer"" and that ""[he hasn't] really studied it."" Icahn has no ability to accelerate the legal and regulatory processes and neither do his nominees.Strong independent Board committed to maximizing shareholder valueA company of Illumina's value creation potential requires a Board invested and experienced in creating clinical markets, driving operational excellence, harnessing the power of science, and realizing a vision for future growth. Illumina's Board brings extensive and diverse business, financial, operating, regulatory and scientific backgrounds in the life sciences and technology sectors, and have presided over the growth of biotech companies, run public life sciences and technology companies, and brought world-class products to market. The Board is led by an independent chair and all nine members are independent, except for the CEO. The Board and management team have a proven track record of successfully managing the core business, and a plan to resolve the acquisition of GRAIL expeditiously and in a manner that is in the best interests of Illumina's shareholders.Illumina's Board of Directors is committed to maximizing value for all shareholders and has always welcomed constructive engagement with the investment community. Illumina's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee interviewed each of Icahn's nominees and found that they lacked relevant skills and experience.At this time, shareholders are not required to take any action with respect to Icahn. Illumina will file preliminary materials with respect to the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in the coming weeks.Forward Looking StatementsThis communication contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding mandates, the future, business plans and other statements that are not historical in nature.

All thanks to an aging population, and the expectation that healthcare companies will be able to cure more of our diseases. The companies that can break into new markets by curing new diseases are set to profit the most from the coming healthcare boom. All of which is great news for healthcare stocks. In fact, companies like CRISPR Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:CRSP) need to show that their new technology is safe, effective, and can be used to treat multiple different diseases.Companies like Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY) need to show growth by getting their treatments in front of more patients. And companies like Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) are banking on every other company in the world to remember that genetics underpins many of our most difficult diseases. And if these companies can prove their theses, they can all pay off big time for investors.CRSPCRISPR Therapeutics$45.74ARAYAccuray$2.80ILMNIllumina$224.55InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)GENE Stock. a stylized image of a Doctor touching a medical clamp a DNA moleculeSource: Natali_ Mis/ShutterStock.comFirst up on this list of healthcare stocks is CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP), which is chasing a trillion-dollar genomic revolution. At the moment, the company is using a technology called CRISPR/Cas to alter the DNA of a patient’s cell, potentially curing them of a genetic disease.  CRISPR has partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) to produce CTX-001, a drug regime to cure sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia.For example, Sickle Cell Anemia and beta-thalassemia are common targets for CRISPR companies because they are blood diseases.  That means you can remove the patient’s blood, treat it in a lab with the CRISPR/Cas drug, and then give the treated blood back to the patient.  This new blood will then cure the patient of the disease by producing new red blood cells.The clinical trial for CTX-001 is slated to end Aug. 2024, and those results will be very important for CRISPR’s future.  But just as important will be the new research that continues to come out on delivering CRISPR drugs to patients.  Not all diseases can be treated by removing part of the patient and then giving it back to them.  CRISPR investors should also stay aware of the new scientific developments in drug delivery systems.  Those new delivery systems will be necessary for CRISPR Therapeutics to realize its full potential. CRISPR’s 2022 earnings report shows a burn rate that should let them stay afloat for many more years, so an investor can afford to be patient.  And if CRISPR succeeds, it could have a huge payout, being the centerpiece of one of the biggest markets in history.Story continuesAccuray (ARAY)DNA strand and Cancer Cell Oncology Research Concept 3D rendering. LIXT StockSource: CI Photos / Shutterstock.comNext up on our list of hot healthcare stocks is Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY), a medical device company using robotic radiation therapy to treat cancer. The company owns CyberKnife, a robot that shoots beams of radiation to destroy cancer cells. Cyberknife is used in a number of medical centers and continues to be studied for new applications. It is an innovative treatment option that could become more widely used in the future.Accuray is a small company with big dreams. If CyberKnife can prove itself superior to other cancer treatments, can become the cancer treatment of the future. This could lead to significant growth for Accuray. Additionally, CyberKnife can not only be used for cancer treatment, but also for non-cancer radiotherapy, expanding its potential market. A number of scientific review articles give CyberKnife positive mentions. But despite this, Accuray’s revenue has shown little growth, which has kept its stock price low. Accuray has managed to sell its machines, but not enough of them, and they aren’t being used everywhere. Accuray needs growth opportunities. It needs to apply radiotherapy for new conditions or update its machines to sell more of them. Failure to achieve growth could keep the company stuck in the doldrums forever.Accuray could be profitable. But standing still in biotech means falling behind, and cutting research would mean getting leapfrogged by other companies. Accuray’s lack of earnings isn’t fatal, but it will need to show growth before investors can truly trust it.Illumina (ILMN)Source: ShutterstockThere are also red-hot healthcare stocks like Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a harbinger of the DNA revolution in healthcare. While the other companies on this list are treating diseases, Illumina is a company you’ll want to buy if you’re betting on the whole healthcare sector. Even 20 years after the completion of the human genome project, scientists are still finding new ways that our DNA affects our health. As a leader in genetics and genomics, Illumina has positioned itself to take advantage of the new opportunities brought on by new science.Illumina makes tools and consumables for reading DNA and RNA. It has plenty of competition in this space, but it holds itself high through its ultra-high-accuracy reads compared to its competitors. Other companies specialize in reading long segments of DNA but have lower accuracy. Illumina specializes in reading short segments of DNA, but at very high accuracy.That might sound like Illumina is missing out on a market, but in many cases Illumina’s shorter reads are sufficient. Meanwhile, their higher accuracy gives them a premium. You can always use a technique like Shotgun Sequencing to break long segments of DNA into shorter ones, read them, and then put them back together. This means there are very few cases where Illumina’s tools aren’t good for a given job.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Virginia Government agency, State Corporation Commission, has approved this program. This will be a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Virginia.RNG is produced from organic waste such as food leftovers, animal manure and wastewater treatment plants. It is a better alternative to traditional natural gas because it is renewable, reduces methane emissions and can be used in the same ways as conventional gas. Initially, the RNG pilot program by Virginia Natural Gas will offer RNG to commercial customers alone. Over time, it will be given to residential customers as well.The Southern Company, one of the largest distributors of natural gas in America, has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and working toward a more sustainable future. The introduction of the aforesaid program is just an example of how it is moving toward its goal. This program will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also minimize waste that would otherwise be sent to landfills.As a leading provider of natural gas, SO has the responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability. The RNG pilot program is a significant step toward achieving these goals, and it will be exciting to see its results and potential expansion in the future.Virginia Natural Gas’ Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (“SAVE”) program cuts methane emissions by replacing old pipelines with durable materials. This ensures safe and cost-effective natural gas delivery. More than 500 miles of pipeline have been replaced since 2012, resulting in a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.The company uses cross-compression technology to capture natural gas during maintenance and reintroduces it to the pipeline system. This reduces methane emissions for a greener natural gas delivery approach.Story continuesIn conclusion, The Southern Company’s RNG pilot program through Virginia Natural Gas is a significant step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability. The Virginia State Corporation Commission's approval and VNG's Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy program demonstrate SO’s commitment toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability.Zacks Rank and Key PicksThe Southern Company is an American utility that provides electricity to customers across the southern United States.

Recently approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, the RNG Interconnect pilot program also authorizes the company to integrate RNG into its natural gas distribution system. (PRNewsfoto/Virginia Natural Gas)The pilot is part of the energy company's Sustainable Gas Program, which will allow for the production and delivery of RNG into VNG's pipeline system and support the procurement of both RNG and Next Generation Natural Gas. This is complementary to VNG's path to reach net-zero direct greenhouse emissions from its operations by 2050. VNG is the first local distribution company in the state to establish a Commission-approved tariff that allows an interconnection between an RNG production facility and a natural gas utility's distribution system.""At Virginia Natural Gas, we are committed to supporting the development of renewable energy sources as we pursue our climate and environmental goals,"" said Robert Duvall, president of Virginia Natural Gas. ""The approval of this pilot program is a significant step as we move forward to develop sustainable, environmentally responsible solutions while helping our state lead in the progress toward a clean energy future.""As part of the approval, Virginia Natural Gas will be able to interconnect RNG production facilities with its existing natural gas pipeline distribution system to encourage the production and delivery of a resilient, alternative source of natural gas while providing additional benefits for the distribution system, customers and local economies.RNG is a low or negative carbon energy solution that is derived from organic waste including farm, municipal, landfill and industrial waste. As these organic waste sources decompose, methane is produced, which is captured and converted to RNG. It is a sustainable and reliable energy source that is compatible with existing infrastructure when blended with natural gas. RNG can be integrated into the VNG distribution system, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and can be used directly in a manner consistent with traditional natural gas for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation purposes.Story continuesAlong with VNG's efforts to support sustainable gas supply opportunities like RNG, other emission reduction efforts at VNG include innovative technologies, such as the use of artificial intelligence to predict third-party damages to critical infrastructure.Additionally, VNG is reducing emissions through the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program by renewing its natural gas infrastructure, replacing aging pipes with new, more durable materials that reduce methane emissions, continue the safe delivery of natural gas, and are less expensive to maintain. Since the program began in 2012, VNG has replaced more than 500 miles of aging pipeline, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31%.The energy company is also utilizing innovative cross-compression technologies to capture natural gas removed during maintenance activities and reinsert it back into the pipeline system for continued use. This results in less gas or methane entering the atmosphere.Learn more information about VNG's sustainable program.About Virginia Natural Gas Virginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corp. CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH.Industry: HMOLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2067207/5-hmo-stocks-to-watch-despite-elevated-tech-costs-nursing-shortageThe U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to benefit from a solid Government business that fetches higher premiums to industry players. Contract wins, a growing customer base and a solid merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy are added tailwinds for the space.Though technology investments are pursued to expand digital capabilities, they might often elevate costs for industry participants. Shortage of nurses is another headwind. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., The Cigna Group, Humana Inc., Centene Corp. and Molina Healthcare, Inc. are better placed to counter the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers' basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance.Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Defining the HMO Industry FutureContinuous Technology Advancements: Owing to the ongoing digitization across every sphere of life, individuals often prefer healthcare services from the comfort of their homes. The demand for digital healthcare services is expected to remain high in the days ahead. As a result, players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay up-to-date with the digital trend.Story continuesDigital investments for health insurers are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms and boosting operational efficiencies. This, in turn, expands digital capabilities and diversifies revenue streams of the players. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Scarcity of Nurses: The U.S. healthcare industry has been grappling with an acute shortage of nurses and other medical personnel for quite some. As more U.S. people continue to reach retirement age, the nursing shortage will likely persist. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to arrange for discounted care access for plan members. This feature remains lucrative for individuals to opt for a particular health insurer's plan.Thereby, an insufficient nursing workforce can dampen a hospital's ability to deliver quality care services to the plan members. This, in turn, can indirectly impact the customer base of health insurers. It can be problematic as the premiums of the HMO players depend, to a large extent, on healthy membership growth. According to a McKinsey report, the United States will likely see a dearth of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025. This further points toward the challenging days that await health insurers.Growing Premiums: A well-performing Government business provides an impetus to the most vital component of a health insurer's top line —  premiums. Through this business, the insurers devise affordable health plans and extend them across several U.S. communities. These plans, integrated with some eye-catchy features, fetch federal or state contracts to the HMO players from time to time.These contract wins boost their customer base. An aging U.S. population sounds well for health insurers as it can sustain the demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above) offered through Government business. But the continued impact of inflation can take a toll on the spending habits of consumers and infuse some uncertainty in their uninterrupted healthcare premium payments.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the HMO space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities and solidify their nationwide presence. Industry players place a keen eye on M&amp;A strategy to increase customer base, introduce new products and services, enter new markets and delve deeper into existing ones. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC's Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #219, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it's worth looking at the industry's recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 7.9% compared with the S&amp;P 500's 14.1% decline and the Zacks Medical sector's decline of 18.6%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 16.84X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 17.46X and the sector's 21.72X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.49X and as low as 12.93X, with the median being at 17.93X.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe present five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Several contract wins have resulted in the membership growth of UNH, which in turn, boosts its top line. It pursues an M&amp;A strategy, which has bolstered its capabilities and extended its nationwide presence. Robust Medicare and Medicaid plans have extended UNH's access across inaccessible regions. The healthcare provider has resorted to developing telehealth services for which it has undertaken significant investments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.91 per share, indicating a 12.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

Even though its shares have lost 6.7% in a year, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Cigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to be driven by solid performances of the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare segments. CI has maintained a solid record of reporting average annual adjusted earnings per share growth higher than the long-term target of 6-8%. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain solid demand for Cigna's Medicare plans. It also benefits on the back of continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.77 per share, suggesting 6.5% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues implies a 3.9% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 9.98%. Its shares have gained 13.8% in a year.Humana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is aided by growing premium revenues from an increasing customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The strength of the cost-effective health plans devised by HUM continues to fetch numerous contract wins and renewed agreements with the company from time to time. An array of buyouts undertaken over the years, such as those of Family Physicians Group, onehome, Curo and Inclusa, has expanded Humana's capabilities and diversified income streams.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana's 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.06 per share, indicating a 11.2% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 11.5% growth from the year-ago actual. HUM's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 12.95%.

Partnerships with healthcare providers of a particular region enable CNC to deliver effective healthcare services and better serve the local community.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene's 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.34 per share, indicating a 9.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure. CNC's earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the average being 4.16%. Its shares have lost 28% in a year, but solid fundamentals of the stock will likely help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Molina Healthcare: This California-based health insurer is driven by a well-performing Government business. The business enables MOH to devise affordable Medicare and Medicare plans based on which it wins several contracts from time to time. Such contract wins result in a growing customer base for MOH. A series of acquisitions made over the years have expanded the business portfolio, diversified revenue streams and solidified the geographical footprint of MOH.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molina Healthcare's 2023 earnings is pegged at $19.76 per share, indicating a 10.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Defense Stocks To Buy Now.A Chinese spy balloon along with 3 other unidentified high-altitude objects have been shot down by the U.S. so far. On March 14, a U.S. drone was shot down by a Russian fighter jet over the black sea. The Russian Su-27 damaged the propellor of the American MQ-9 Reaper drone, after flying in close proximity over it, and forced it down. Meanwhile, the Ukraine war is still ongoing and there is still no end in sight, rather there is a risk of the war escalating.Defense Analyst: ""There's A Pretty Good Long-Term Setup""On February 13 Cowen's defense and aerospace analyst, Roman Schweizer appeared in an interview on CNBC and to discuss the geopolitical situation and his view on the defense sector and defense stocks. ""This is a very peculiar period in time"", said Schweizer as he talked about the recent airborne objects shot down in North America. Schweizer thinks that unidentified objects flying at such high altitude can pose risk to commercial air travel. Here are some comments from Roman Schweizer about the U.S. defense budget, potential budget cuts, and defense stocks:""I'd say that the group (defense stocks) has underperformed, since the GOP (Republicans) kinda came out with wanting those what would be potentially 10% spending cuts. Really, when you look at the backlog in spending, 2 years ago the budget was up 7%, last year up 10%. We estimate there's about $37 billion in funds for Ukraine that haven't been put on contract for some of the large defense primes. So the pump is primed and as soon as we get into some of the budgetary details, if any of that overhang lifts, it certainly is gonna bode well for the companies.""Roman Schweizer is positive on the defense sector and sees it driving outperformance. Schweizer thinks the consensus is that the Ukraine war is a ""multi-year conflict"" and defense spending is going up in not just the U.S., but also in Japan and Europe. Schweizer also noted that the supply-chain issues and labor shortages due to COVID-19 are also fading away and the defense sector is ""starting to operate better"". Finally, Roman Schweizer said that he thinks ""there's a pretty good long-term setup"" for defense stocks.Story continuesAs the Ukraine war enters its second year, geopolitical risk is rising and defense spending is going up with it. On March 13, the U.S. Department of Defense released the proposed defense budget for fiscal 2024. The Biden-Harris Administration has submitted a request to Congress to increase the defense budget for fiscal 2024 to $842 billion, up $26 billion from fiscal 2023.Amid rising geopolitical tensions, the outlook for the defense sector is starting to look attractive.

Still, some on Wall Street suggest the tightening in credit conditions - following the wobble in the banking system - will serve the same role as monetary policy tightening and play a bigger role in the Fed's future monetary policy decision.Bank of America, citing tighter lending standards, said it now only expects one more 25 basis points rate hike to lift rates to a terminal range of 5.0 to 5.25%, down 25bp from its prior target terminal range.Banks were back in the firing line, paced by a decline in First Republic Bank as investors were forced to rethink rate cuts that some believed were needed to help restore confidence in the banking system.First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) fell almost 16%, Comerica (NYSE:CMA) fell 8.5% and Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) fell almost 8%.As Treasury yields moved off session lows, rate-sensitive sectors of the market including tech lost momentum.Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the day below session highs.GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), however, bucked the trend lower, racking up a 35% gain on the day after delivering a surprise fourth-quarter profit.Story continuesSome on Wall Street, however, flagged low margin growth as a concern as cost cuts played a large role in helping the company return to profit.""The company exceeded consensus EPS estimates primarily from cost control. Although we applaud management for its successful cost-cutting in the January quarter, it is worth noting that operating income of $46.2 million reflected a margin of just 2.1%,"" Wedbush said in a note.Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), meanwhile, reported fiscal third-quarter results that beat expectations, but softer than expected sales in its key China market weighed.""China came in just below Street forecasts, but still grew 1% cFX YOY as the company experienced a rebound in January post the COVID-19 disruptions in December and noted 'strong retail momentum' around Chinese New Year accelerating into February,"" Credit Suisse said in a note.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow ends down as Fed hikes, Powell shoots down rate-cut betsHershey looking to 'eradicate' lead, cadmium from chocolate -CFOCoinbase gets Wells notice from U.S. SEC over Earn product, wallet]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now. Augmented reality is set to revolutionize the ways we interact with our surroundings. Most folks often confuse augmented reality with virtual reality, and for the sake of this piece, it's better to first understand what both terms mean. Simply put, augmented reality is an 'enhancement' of reality itself in a virtual manner, while virtual reality 'transports' the user into an altogether different environment. In essence, while all augmented reality is virtual reality, the vice versa is false.With that out of the way, let's take a look at the many ways in which augmented reality is transforming businesses and by extension, the general consumer's interaction with them. One such use case was applied in London's Gatwick International Airport - one of the busiest airports in the country. This saw management place 2,000 beacons inside the airport's two terminals, with the aim to allow passengers to navigate between entering the airport and boarding their flight. The beacons enabled travelers to identify their route and location within the airport and locate gates, desks, and other facilities.Another remarkable use of augmented reality, this time in an industrial context, is the use of Google Glass by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). While Google announced in March 2023 that it will stop selling the Google Glass Enterprise Edition and continue replacing damaged hardware until September, General Electric has already put the augmented reality product to great use. The firm, whose operations involve manufacturing precision components for machines such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, reports that by using Google Glass and augmented reality, it was able to increase its order completion time by a whopping 46%. GE's Healthcare division has also partnered with a medical technology company to develop the OmnifyXR Interventional Suite System. Through this, the firm aims to provide physicians with the remarkable opportunity to view a patient's anatomy holographically by using Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s HoloLens technology - which is also used in accessories for the firm's Xbox gaming console.Story continuesIn addition to manufacturing and navigation, augmented reality can also play a major role in revolutionizing marketing, according to Deloitte. Deloitte believes that augmented reality will allow for a greater connection between the advertisement agencies and their target audience, through better storytelling and a greater immersive experience. For these immersive stores, advertisers need to apply virtual reality thoughtfully, understand the story, do not force the brand into the story, and ensure that the customer is actually receptive to the content being delivered.Finally, shifting back to the consumer end, another key industry that is also using augmented reality is the electronic commerce industry. McKinsey outlines that retail consumers in the UK, Germany, and France strongly resonate with augmented reality features offered by electronic commerce platforms which allow them to 'test' products before making a purchase.All these, and many more use cases paint a bright picture for the augmented reality market. A research report from International Data Corporation (IDC) outlines a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.3% for the industry. IDC estimated in November 2022 that global AR/VR spending totaled $13.8 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR until 2026 when it will sit at $50.9 billion. It adds that industrial uses and training applications will continue to be the strongest segments of the market, and will account for 44% of the total presence. It adds that the gaming segment will account for 25% of the total market. IDC also shares eye popping growth rates for the different industry segments, as it outlines that growth in emergency response applications will be double the rate of the overall market by marking an 82.9% growth rate. The U.S. will account for one third of the market, and China will grow at a 42.2% CAGR.This high growth rate was also corroborated by the management of Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI), an American firm that makes and sells augmented and virtual reality devices. At a recent earnings call conference, management revealed that:It bears repeating that the use of augmented reality by most business organizations and, ultimately, consumers remains the wave of the future. Despite the technical challenges encountered when making AR glasses and their uneven and unpredictable adoption curve seen to date, most entities around the world are realigning their future strategies around AR glasses with AI. The expected ubiquitous use of AI across applications in areas such as education, e-commerce, health care, communications, defense, security and more that hand the glove with AR smart glasses, examples like visual search, language translation, voice control, the list goes on and on.This marriage of technology will accelerate the need and use cases for lightweight wearable displays. Vuzix is an AR smart glasses optics and display engine pioneer. The company was built from the ground up over the last 25 years to deliver on the larger promise of AR and, as such, is well positioned to participate in this emerging market.Today, we'll look at some top augmented reality companies, with the notable picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

Corp VFC has been witnessing a tough operating environment and continued supply-chain headwinds, including higher lead times and increased volatility on the distribution and logistics front. This led to a sluggish year-over-year performance in third-quarter fiscal 2022.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 declined 17% year over year. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, adjusted earnings per share were down 10%. Net revenues of $3,531 million dipped 3% year over year due to weakness in the EMEA and APAC regions, partly offset by the solid performance in the outdoor brands, particularly The North Face. Revenues of the company’s big four brands were down 3%, while the rest of the portfolio decreased 2%.The fiscal third-quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 140 bps to 54.9% due to higher promotions. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 280 bps to 14.9% due to a lower gross margin. SG&amp;A expenses rose 5% to $1,421.6 million.Moving on, the company’s China business continues to remain dismal. Notably, fiscal third-quarter APAC revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis (up 4% at cc), whereas revenues in Greater China fell 11% (down 1% at cc). Although its raw material suppliers across China are currently operational, it saw an eight-week lockdown in China in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This led to logistics-related issues causing ongoing product delays. VFC is working with its suppliers to minimize disruptions. Currently, China has been witnessing sequential improvement as it reopens, but lower consumer spending remains concerning.Consequently, the company expects fiscal 2023 constant dollar revenue growth of 3%, down from the earlier mention of 5-6%. Vans brand revenues for the fiscal year will now be down in the high-single digits compared with the prior mentioned mid-single digits. VFC forecasts gross margin to decline 200 bps year over year compared with the prior mentioned decline of 100-150 bps. The adjusted operating margin is envisioned to be 9.5%, down from the earlier mentioned 11%. V.F. Corp expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.05-$2.15 compared with the $2.40-$2.50 stated earlier.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of VFC have lost 18.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.5%.Efforts to Counter HurdlesThat said, management is leaving no stone unturned to get back on track. It remains focused on the strategic review of its Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport brands, as well as the divestiture and leaseback of its Europe headquarters in Stabio, Switzerland. VFC is focused on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories.Also, it has been accelerating its cost-saving efforts, which are likely to generate $225 million in fiscal 2024, on an annual basis, after the completion of its previously announced actions.For fiscal 2024, revenues are anticipated to grow in the low-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. Gross and operating margins are likely to expand. Operating income is expected to grow in double digits, whereas the operating cash flow is likely to grow faster than earnings.Gains from the Supreme buyout remain a key growth driver for V.F. Corp. The company is benefitting from Supreme’s strong follower base in the younger generation, even when consumers are moving away from apparel to essential spending. The acquisition has accelerated its 2024 strategy. This strengthens the company’s long-standing partnership with Supreme. V.F. Corp collaborated with Supreme for its brands, such as The North Face, Vans and Timberland, on various occasions.Management also unveiled its five-year growth plan for fiscal 2023-2027. The company expects revenue five-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of mid- to high-single digits. The bottom line is predicted to grow, seeing a five-year CAGR of high single to low-double digits. The operating margin is envisioned to be 15% by fiscal 2027, driven by gross margin expansion and reduced SG&amp;A. Management also noted that it would return roughly $7 billion via dividends and share repurchases by fiscal 2027. Free cash flow is forecast to be $5.5 billion.Bottom LineAll said, we believe that the aforementioned initiatives will help offset supply-chain woes and other macroeconomic headwinds.

Climate activists block an escalator at the New York headquarters of the financial investment firm BlackRock in October.Since the Paris Agreement in 2016, the biggest banks that fund the fossil fuel industry seem to have minimally decreased their support, and in some cases are actually increasing their funding.That’s according to the 2022 Fossil Fuel Finance report (pdf), which is published by a conglomerate of organizations including Banktrack, Reclaim Finance, Oil Change International, the Sierra Club, and the Rainforest Action Network.Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?The methodology of the report states that the authors totaled financing (lending, and underwriting of debt and equity issuances) from the world’s 60 biggest banks for the fossil fuel sector as a whole, as well as for top expanders of the fossil fuel industry and top companies in specific sectors.According to the report, the worst offenders are JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, and Bank of America.

JPMorgan Chase stated that it committed in October 2020 to align key sectors of its financing portfolio with what it considers to be the primary goals of the Paris Agreement.

Smaller, more regional banks that specialize in certain industries are crucial for the economy. The hope, Kaul says, is that banks catering specifically to startups and entrepreneurs will still be around in the wake of SVB. Smaller, more specialized banks are important because they truly understand the unique needs of their customers.

As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.”Story continuesWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is in 30th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Until now, the federal government had been Moderna’s lone U.S. customer, buying doses in bulk to make sure that people weren’t charged anything.The government paid around $15 per dose in 2020 and more than $26 last summer for Moderna’s bivalent booster, according to an analysis by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation.More than 270 million doses of Moderna’s original COVID-19 vaccine and booster shots have been administered in the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That makes it the second most popular coronavirus vaccine, trailing the shot made by Pfizer, which is also raising prices.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., noted that Moderna has made more than $20 billion in profits over the past two years, and the federal government contributed billions of dollars toward the vaccine’s development.The hike will hit government payers like Medicaid and cost taxpayers, Sanders said as he pressed Bancel to reconsider the price.The CEO said Moderna gave the government a discount with its initial prices. Now, the company must assume more costs and risk, he said.He said, for instance, that the drugmaker will switch to single-dose vials from ones that held 10 doses.He also that Moderna will have to make more doses than it anticipates using to ensure enough is available. The company will then have to eat the cost of unused doses, something the government has done.“The volume we had during the pandemic gave us economies of scale we won’t have anymore,” he said.Story continuesSanders later asked Bancel if Moderna was prepared to negotiate the price with Medicare, Medicaid and other agencies. Bancel replied that Moderna was “having discussions with all the different customers.”While Moderna’s list price for its Spikevax vaccine will soar, company leaders have emphasized that people with insurance will continue to pay nothing out of pocket for the shots. Moderna also has a patient assistance program that will cover shots for people without coverage or who are underinsured.Senators noted during Wednesday's hearing that these programs can involve complex paperwork and be difficult to use.“We want that (patient assistance program) to be something that works for patients and is not just something that’s like, ’Oh yeah, we have it, but no one can use it,'” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor.Bancel said Moderna will announce more details this fall on plans to help the uninsured, and the company was working to make the program as “easy as possible to access.”Pfizer also has said it will charge $110 to $130 for a dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. It also cited the cost of switching to single-dose vials and commercial distribution in explaining the new prices. Pfizer used no government funding to develop its vaccine.____Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thpmurphy___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The companies are expected to have combined revenue from Xtandi of more than $2 billion this calendar year, according to data from Refinitiv.Astellas said the decision would protect public-private partnerships as ""incubators of technological innovation.""March-in rights were introduced as a safeguard in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which allows the inventors to retain ownership of inventions developed with public funds and hold patents, as is the case with Xtandi.Progressive lawmakers in the Democratic Party have been calling on President Joe Biden's administration to use its march-in authority to lower drug prices.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also denied a petition for a congressional hearing concerning potential price gouging on the drug, Representative Lloyd Doggett, the top Democrat on the House's Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said in a statement.The HHS and the Department of Commerce (DOC) said on Tuesday they would undertake a review of the government's march-in authority as laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act.

Bernie Sanders (D-VT), who chairs the committee, sent a letter to Bancel in January asking the company to halt its price increase. In February, a staff report identified Moderna among 10 companies that benefitted from government purchases during the pandemic and reported a total of $102 billion in total revenue for 2021 — a 137% increase from the prior year.""The purpose of the recent taxpayer investment in Moderna was to protect the health and lives of the American people, not to turn a handful of corporate executives and investors into multi-billionaires,” Sanders wrote to Bancel.Moderna president Stephen Hoge defended the new price tag for the vaccine in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance, saying that the company was entering unchartered waters, jumping from a government-funded market to a commercial market. And that's for it's first-ever commercial product. No company has ever faced such a shift, he said.""This has literally never happened before. And so what we are trying to do, as one of the many manufacturers in the space, is to pick a price we think reflects the value of the vaccine ... but also reflects the complexity of moving from this pandemic market to a commercial market,"" Hoge said.It isn't the only company to do so. Rival Pfizer (PFE) also indicated a $110 - $130 range for its list price.But the raising of the price for a commercial market, which Moderna says is a result of the government not paying for doses, will not impact most individuals. In a clarification statement last month, Moderna said the vaccine will remain free at pharmacies and doctor's offices for insured individuals, and those who are not covered can get it free via the company's patient assistance program.Story continues""There is zero out of pocket cost for any person in the United States this fall,"" Hoge said.Unlike the pandemic, when governments have supply contracts in place for millions of doses, the commercial market brings uncertainty. The U.S. government contracted a total of 566 million doses for roughly $30 per dose from Moderna, and has taken on the responsibility of distribution as well as discarding of expired or unused doses — all costs that will be shifted to Moderna. In addition, Moderna now has manufacturing costs of single dose vials instead of the standard multiple-dose vials during the pandemic.""It's not like we get to make exactly the right number of doses. We've got to make a lot, to make sure that if...we have really good demand, that we're able to serve it,"" Hoge said.So any unused product becomes a loss for the company — a concern going into the Fall as booster uptake has waned.CEO of Moderna Stephane Bancel looks up at the session ""State of the Pandemic"" during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, January 18, 2023. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannPandemic boonBut lawmakers have been focused on Moderna, because of the two major players, it benefited more from the government's help and investment early on in developing the vaccine.That is the stance Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), who leads the HELP committee, took in a recent letter to Bancel.Sanders noted the nearly $2.5 billion investment Moderna received through the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed. That included $1.5 billion to help manufacture and distribute the first batch of 100 million doses, as well as $954 million to help with development and clinical phase trials.By comparison, Pfizer, a pharmaceutical giant, said it invested $2 billion of its own money to co-develop its vaccine with partner BioNTech (BNTX). The company did receive the largest initial supply contract, $1.95 billion, for its vaccine from Operation Warp Speed.But Moderna contends it took into account the taxpayer support, with offering a discounted price to the government during the pandemic, and discounts on other vaccines, Hoge said.""We think we've paid that back, and then some, already, as a result of the discounts that we offered over the last two to three years,"" he said.Hoge also pointed to other vaccines that range in price from $70 per dose, like flu — which is also provided to the public at no cost — and other vaccines that can cost upwards of $200.""I think we're well within that range,"" Hoge said, adding that the coronavirus market is a brand new market with a handful of — at most three — players.Before the pandemic, Moderna was a small biotech. In 2019, the company had $1.3 billion cash on hand, compared to the more than 300% jump to $4 billion at the end of 2020.The company ended 2022 with $18 billion cash on hand. But Sanders is also focused on the company executives who received bonuses as a result of government purchased doses, as well as investments by the government from development through manufacturing of the product. Over time, including overseas, Moderna has also built out its own manufacturing partnerships.But the government relationship precedes the pandemic, when Moderna had been working on the mRNA technology for other potential uses in coordination with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Even after the COVID-19 vaccine was successfully produced, and after all the government investment, Moderna was engaged in a dispute with NIH about who owns the vaccine patent rights. But the company eventually abandoned the patent fights and paid the NIH a licensing fee of $400 million for a part of the mRNA technology used in the vaccine, to be shared by researchers and partners.Patent battlesIt has been widely reported that three NIH researchers in particular — John Mascola, Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett — helped advance work from SARS and MERS into the code that was shared with Moderna to develop the vaccine. And that relationship started a few years prior, as the company had been working with NIH since 2016 to develop the mRNA platform.In SEC filings in 2020, Moderna acknowledged the close relationship with NIH, including that NIH would be running the clinical trial. And most recently, the company announced it had abandoned the patent.""Moderna has permanently abandoned certain patent applications relating to mRNA-1273 that were the subject of discussions with the NIH,"" Moderna said in a statement.""Our abandonment of the patent applications means that going forward no one using the claimed technology will ever be required to pay for it. We value our relationship with NIH and will continue to look for opportunities to collaborate further as we move forward in developing new mRNA vaccines and treatments,"" the company said.But, on the flip side, the company sued Pfizer and BioNTech last year, accusing the duo of copying technology that Moderna used to make its COVID-19 vaccine. The lawsuits were filed in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. The U.K. is the only one to set a date, recently announcing April 2024 for the trial.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(AP) — Lawyers for Fox News and a voting machine company tangled Wednesday over the high bar to prove defamation in a $1.6 billion lawsuit that has embarrassed the conservative network over its airing of false claims related to the 2020 presidential election.The argument is at the heart of each side's attempt to persuade a Delaware judge that he should grant summary judgment in its favor and avoid a jury trial scheduled to start next month that would focus in part on media protections afforded in a nearly six-decade-old libel standard.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems claims that Fox program hosts, with the knowledge of executives for both Fox News and parent company Fox Corp., repeatedly allowed allies of former President Donald Trump to falsely claim that the machines and the software the company used were responsible for Trump’s election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn’t believe the claims but aired them anyway.Fox contends that it can't be held liable for defamation for simply reporting on newsworthy allegations — a sitting president’s claim that the election was being stolen from him.Fox attorney Erin Murphy argued Wednesday that the parent company cannot be held “vicariously liable” simply because Fox Corp. executives, including chairman Rupert Murdoch, might have had knowledge of who was appearing on Fox shows and sometimes communicated with Fox News officials.“Fox Corp. doesn’t belong in the case at all,” she said.Murphy also argued that Dominion cannot demonstrate that anyone at Fox Corp. acted with actual malice without first proving that that person directly participated in any of 17 programs that aired between Nov. 8, 2020, and Jan. 26, 2021, in which the allegedly defamatory statements were made. In addition to the programs, Dominion is claiming that three tweets from former Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs were defamatory.Story continuesDobbs repeatedly offered a platform for Trump lawyer Sidney Powell to make unproven allegations about Dominion. Murphy argued that Dobbs often went “out of his way” to acknowledge evidence on the other side and explained why he had doubts. He also offered several invitations for Dominion representatives to appear on his show but was always turned down, Murphy said.“I don’t think that’s consistent with actual malice,” she said.Her comments came one day after Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Fox appeared to have “a Dobbs problem.”Stephen Shackelford Jr., an attorney for Dominion, said Fox can't escape the fact that Powell, during a Nov. 13, 2020, Dobbs program, made a clearly false statement that Dominion was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for late president Hugo Chavez.“Fox viewers don’t expect Dobbs to bring liars on to his show to lie to them,” Shackelford said.“Sidney Powell was hunting for somebody to make her relevant, and Fox made her relevant,” he added.The two-day summary judgment hearing was perhaps the most significant court action to date in a lawsuit that already has revealed Fox personalities’ private disdain for Trump and illustrated how political pressures can inform its coverage. The case also holds the potential for redefining libel law in the U.S.Dominion attorneys say Fox employees allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes from Trump to Joe Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Chavez, and offered bribes or kickbacks to government officials who used its machines.Fox attorneys argue that the key issue is not whether the allegations were true or false, but whether it was accurately reporting the allegations. They also argue that there is a critical distinction between a factual statement and an opinion.“Despite the noise and confusion that Dominion has generated by presenting cherry-picked quotes without context, this case is ultimately about the First Amendment protections of the media’s absolute need to cover the news,"" Fox News said in a prepared statement Wednesday.Dominion said in a statement that it is “a strong believer in the First Amendment and its protections.”“As long-settled law makes clear, the First Amendment does not shield broadcasters that knowingly or recklessly spread lies,” the statement added.]"

412,8e0942b3-4acc-360c-b132-537b84ce451d,FOXA,2023-03-23,UPDATE 5-Fox faces skeptical judge in Dominion defamation suit,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fox-dominion-pursue-pretrial-135746827.html,1679407066,STORY,['FOXA'],"[(Recasts with Fox presentation to judge)By Jack Queen and Helen CosterWILMINGTON, Delaware, March 21 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Fox Corp faced a skeptical judge on Tuesday as they sought to block a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems from going to trial, while the voting-technology company accused Fox News of knowingly airing vote-rigging claims that the network knew were false.Both sides made presentations during a hearing in Wilmington before Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, asking him to rule in their favor on various legal questions rather than proceeding to a full trial scheduled to start on April 17.The judge peppered a Fox lawyer with questions about its defense against Dominion's assertion that the network knew that allegations by former President Donald Trump and his lawyers of vote-rigging in the 2020 U.S. election were false but continued putting the claims on the air anyway in pursuit of ratings.Dominion argues that this meets the ""actual malice"" standard to win a defamation case under which a plaintiff must prove a defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Fox lawyer Erin Murphy disagreed.Fox's lawyers also invoked the legal doctrine of ""neutral reportage,"" which holds that the press cannot be held liable for publishing newsworthy allegations in a neutral way.Davis said there was tension between Fox's arguments on ""actual malice"" and ""neutral reportage.""""To me, it doesn't seem intellectually honest that you apply actual malice and say there's neutral reporting privilege,"" Davis said, adding: ""How can you be neutral if you're knowingly doing false things?""Murphy sought to provide context for the defamatory statements alleged by Dominion and argued that reasonable viewers understood that the claims aired on Fox News were mere allegations. The Fox News statements cited by Dominion included a Twitter post by former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs that included pro-Trump hashtags.Story continues""You're saying he's a neutral reporter?"" Davis asked Murphy, who responded that Dobbs was not being neutral in his support for Trump but did not write the hashtag #DominionVoterFraud.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by airing false claims by Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. Fox has argued that coverage of these claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of press freedom.It is one of the most closely watched defamation cases involving a major U.S. media organization in years, pitting the influential cable news network that features conservative commentators against a company that claims Fox's coverage destroyed its business.Both sides are seeking summary judgment - asking the judge to decide the case in their favor before it goes to a jury trial. Davis said he does not plan to rule from the bench and will issue a written opinion sometime later. The hearing is due to resume on Wednesday.'RELEASE THE KRAKEN'In their presentation to the judge, Dominion's lawyers said internal Fox communications prove that the network repeatedly hosted guests who it knew were peddling ""reckless"" and ""completely crazy"" falsehoods because it was losing viewers to far-right media competitors.""They chose to let the story be out there - to let out the hoax, to release the Kraken,"" lawyer Rodney Smolla said, referring to a nickname for Sidney Powell, who was a lawyer for Trump. ""And why? Because Fox viewers were abandoning Fox.""Davis seemed particularly interested in whether 20 allegedly defamatory statements cited by Dominion were facts, opinions or a mix of the two. He also sought clarity on Dominion's legal theories.""Are you saying that Fox adopts Trump's statements just because the president said at a press conference that the election was a hoax?"" Davis asked.Lawyer Justin Nelson answered no, saying Dominion's allegation is that Fox knew Trump's lawyers were going to make false claims but hosted them on its shows anyway.Separately, a Fox News producer filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing the network's lawyers of pressuring her to provide misleading testimony in the Dominion case.Abby Grossberg, who was head of booking for Fox News host Tucker Carlson, said coaching and intimidation by Fox lawyers before her deposition left her ""feeling pressured not to name names or to implicate others, in particular prominent male on-air personalities and Fox News executives.""Fox said in a statement on Tuesday that Grossberg's ""allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless and we will vigorously defend Fox against all of her claims.""(Reporting by Jack Queen in Wilmington and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Will Dunham and Amy Stevens)]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Digital Currency and Payments Stocks to Buy Now. One aspect of our daily lives that has completely transformed over the past decade or so is payments. The advent of the smartphone and the rise of the internet has brought everyone's bank account right at their fingertips and created new digital wallets where money is stored on the Internet. This enables everyday users to use their smartphones to pay for a wide variety of goods and services and increases the convenience offered to them in their daily lives.This growth in digital payments isn't only a characteristic of the developed world. In fact, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic spurred growth in the digital payments market as it accelerated a shift to online platforms. This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed.Today, we'll look at some top digital payments stocks, with the notable picks being PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(PYPL): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-paypal-holdings-130001646.html,1679490001,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share, indicating a change of +22.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.89 points to a change of +18.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.72 indicates a change of +16.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $6.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. The $29.2 billion and $31.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.1% and +8.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.89% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.68%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology platform and digital payments company had lost 2.24% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.42% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.9% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Paypal as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.08, up 22.73% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.97 billion, up 7.52% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.89 per share and revenue of $29.2 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.4% and +6.12%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% higher within the past month. Paypal is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Paypal is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.91. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 41.28, so we one might conclude that Paypal is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that PYPL currently has a PEG ratio of 0.86. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.62 at yesterday's closing price.The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 66, which puts it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. During the fourth quarter, Horos Value Internacional fund gained 13.7% compared to the benchmark’s return of 0.8% while the yearly return of the fund was 4.9% compared to a 13.0% decline for the benchmark. On the other hand, Horos Value Iberia gained 12.1% in the quarter and fell -5.2% in 2022, compared to an 11.9% gain over the quarter and a 2% rise in the year for the benchmark. In addition, check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Horos Asset Management highlighted stocks like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in San Jose, California, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a digital technology platform. On March 17, 2023, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock closed at $72.99 per share. One-month return of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was -2.24%, and its shares lost 36.34% of their value over the last 52 weeks. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market capitalization of $82.579 billion.Horos Asset Management made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Baidu.PayPal is one of the world's largest online payment companies and the leader (ex-China) among digital wallets. The company operates on both sides of a transaction, offering services that facilitate buying for its users and selling for merchants, acting as a payment gateway. In recent years, PayPal has expanded its ecosystem, organically and inorganically, into other financial services (business and consumer lending, remittances, fraud prevention, dataphones, card payments, etc.) and marketing (discounts, targeted campaigns, etc.). Its most successful current products are probably Venmo (an app with services like PayPal, but with a social network component, which successfully attracts a younger audience), Braintree (payment gateway) and its interest-free consumer finance service (Buy Now, Pay Later).This rich ecosystem has allowed PayPal to continue its high growth in recent years, reaching 432 million active accounts (of which some 35 million correspond to merchants) by the end of the third quarter of 2022, as well as increasing the attractiveness for its customers, as evidenced by the record number of transactions per account recorded in the latest earnings release. In addition to this, PayPal has achieved a historic milestone, reaching an agreement with Amazon that will allow its customers to buy products with Venmo's payment service. However, not all has been good news for PayPal in recent years. The reality is that this growth has not been accompanied by the operating leverage that was expected, which contributed to the negative sentiment towards the company in 2022, already elevated due to the burst in the tech sector valuations and the recessionary environment in many economies where PayPal operates. However, the management team has taken action and is starting a series of initiatives to expand margins significantly over the next few years. This turnaround, coupled with a (now) very attractive valuation, led us to reinvest in the company.""www.BillionPhotos.com / Shutterstock.comStory continuesPayPal Holdings, Inc.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.89%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.68%.Heading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 8.39% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.42% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.9% in that time.IBM will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.27, down 9.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.29 billion, up 0.62% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.46 per share and revenue of $62.09 billion, which would represent changes of +3.61% and +2.58%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, IBM is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 13.07. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.52.Story continuesInvestors should also note that IBM has a PEG ratio of 3.2 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Computer - Integrated Systems stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.37 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 169, which puts it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

424,c5cf0809-4e58-37c8-9e48-75379291b8be,IBM,2023-03-23,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130001068.html,1679317201,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share, indicating a change of -9.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 points to a change of +3.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.92 indicates a change of +4.8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.29 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The $62.09 billion and $64.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.6% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more. One bright shining star stock has been Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), which is 508% higher than three years ago. On top of that, the share price is up 15% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.Since it's been a strong week for Marathon Petroleum shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Marathon Petroleum achieved compound earnings per share growth of 127% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 82% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 3.92.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marathon Petroleum has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Marathon Petroleum's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Marathon Petroleum, it has a TSR of 584% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Marathon Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 63% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Marathon Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

426,c46745e4-9b6c-34b8-a9c5-b3abe422766b,MPC,2023-03-23,Rio Tinto's and Adidas have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tintos-adidas-highlighted-zacks-113111890.html,1679484671,STORY,"['RIO', 'ADS.DE', 'SI=F', '^GSPC', 'MPC', 'VLO', 'CVI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 22, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Rio Tinto's RIO as the Bull of the Day and Adidas ADDYY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CVR Energy CVI, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Valero Energy VLO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Mining-Miscellaneous Industry is currently in the top 30% of over 248 Zacks Industries and Rio Tinto's stock is standing out with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and overall ""A"" VGM grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Rio Tinto is positioned to benefit from its strong business environment and higher commodity prices as an international miner of aluminum, borax, coal, copper and iron ore, lead, gold and silver, uranium, titanium, and diamonds among others. The Australian-based miner has mining operations in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe, and Canada.Good Value Following another strong year, Rio Tinto's earnings are expected to dip -9% to $7.38 per share in fiscal 2023 compared to EPS of $8.15 in 2022. However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rebound and rise 4% to $7.70 per share.Plus, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher for FY23 as commodity prices have remained higher in correlation with inflation. Rio Tinto's FY23 EPS estimates have jumped 13% throughout the quarter with FY24 estimates up 2%.Even better, the rising earnings estimates support the case that Rio Tinto's stock appears to be undervalued. Shares of RIO trade around $66 and just 9X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500's 18.1X and its industry average of 10X. Rio Tinto stock also trades 72% below its decade-long high of 32.2X and at a slight discount to the median of 10.1X.Total ReturnYear to date, Rio Tinto stock is down -7% but this year's drop may be a buying opportunity, especially when considering RIO's stellar dividend. To that point, RIO's total return including dividends over the last three years is still +139% to easily top the S&amp;P 500's +85% and the Mining-Miscellaneous Markets' +92%.Story continuesAt the moment, Rio Tinto's annual dividend yield is 6.76% at $4.49 per share. This is well above the S&amp;P 500's 1.61% average and the Mining-Miscellaneous Markets' 4.36%. More Impressive, Rio Tinto's annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 14.19%.TakeawayThe rising earnings estimate revisions are a good sign that Rio Tinto will continue to benefit from higher commodity prices. On top of this, shares of RIO look undervalued from a price to earnings perspective, making the stock very attractive considering its stellar dividend and inflation-fighting ability. Furthermore, the Average Zacks Price Target of $90.50 per share suggests 36% upside from current levels.Bear of the Day:Adidas stock may be in store for a bearish downturn landing a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment. To that point, the Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is also in the bottom 11% of over 248 Zacks Industries.On top of high inflation disrupting consumer spending, the footwear and apparel provider is dealing with massive revenue losses from severing its partnership with Kanye West following antisemitic comments the entertainer made last year.Declining Earnings Estimates Adidas has stated it expects to lose $1.3 billion from cutting ties with Kanye West and discontinuing his popular Yeezy brand with the trendy shoes once retailing between $200-585 per pair.Adidas also expects to lose up to $534 million in operating profit from the breakup. Confirming this is the declining earnings estimate revisions. Adidas is now expected to have an adjusted loss of -$.1.54 per share this year compared to estimates of $2.13 a share 90 days ago. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have declined 53%.Poor Performance &amp; CompetitionLosing the popularity of its Yeezy brand, Adidas could lose many fashion consumers back to its main competitor Nike. Adidas stock is up +12% year to date to top Nike's +6% and the S&amp;P 500's +3%.However, the rebound attempt may be overdone considering the decline in earnings estimates as Adidas stock Is still down -54% over the last two years to largely underperform Nike's -10% and the benchmark.Furthermore, over the last decade, Adidas is only up +47% and has continued to lag the S&amp;P 500's +154%, Nike's +319%, and the Shoe &amp; Retail Apparel Markets +273%. This purgatory-like performance could continue with other companies like New Balance and Skechers becoming more fashionable and capitalizing on trends among younger generations.Bottom LineInvestors will want to be cautious of Adidas stock as the earnings picture continues to decline for the company. With inflation headwinds still affecting the broader Consumer Discretionary sector, ending its Yeezy partnership has unfortunately added more financial risk to Adidas and opened the door for increased competition.Additional content:3 Stocks for Oil &amp; Gas Contrarians to BuyNow that oil prices are below $70 a barrel it seems investors have lost faith in their energy investments. But what if the recent drop in oil and sentiment is just a fake out?Bolstered by geopolitical tensions, high inflation, and anemic domestic production, energy stocks posted a banner year in 2022. Energy was the only sector in the market that finished last year in the green, and it did so emphatically, up nearly 60%.With higher interest rates and now a banking crisis many analysts think a recession is just around the corner. That would be bad for oil demand and energy stocks. But last week OPEC publicly committed to significantly cutting production, putting a floor under the price of oil. And now with the Fed potentially easing off the interest rate hikes, it is possible there is another rally in inflation.Additionally, there is this kind of well-known investor names Warren Buffett who knows a thing or two about investing in stocks. Buffett cannot stop buying oil stocks, indicating that he thinks energy is still an appealing investment.The price of oil is down nearly 50% from its 2022 high, yet many of the top oil and gas stocks are still holding up well. Even after the tremendous run up energy stocks had in 2022, many of them still boast reasonable valuations. In this article I will cover three highly ranked energy stocks that have forward earnings multiples below 10x, which help make them very compelling investments right now.CVR EnergyHeadquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel. CVI owns and operates a coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Kansas and a crude oil refinery in Oklahoma. The business serves retailers, railroads, farms and other refineries and marketers.CVR Energy is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. CVI has been a strong performing stock over the last year and offers a very generous dividend yield of 6.5%.Over the next few earnings periods sales are expected to fall, but current quarter earnings are still expected to skyrocket 4,300% YoY to $0.88 per share. Over the last 60 days analysts have unanimously revised earnings higher across all reporting periods. Current year earnings expectations have nearly doubled over the last three months.CVI is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 9x, which is below its 10-year median of 12x, and above the industry average 5x.Marathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Marathon Petroleum's Refining and Marketing unit operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics, transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC stock has been extremely strong over the last year. It has outperformed the industry and market considerably. Even with the weakness in the sector, its share price is still very close to breaking out to new all-time highs again.Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating an upward trend in earnings revisions. While sales are projected to fall across the board, earnings have been revised higher nonetheless. Additionally, it has a very impressive earnings surprise prediction. The stock is expected to beat on all the next earnings reports, with next quarter projected to beat by 28%.MPC is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6x, which is just above the industry average of 5x, and well below its five-year median of 11x. Marathon Petroleum also offers a dividend yield of 2.4%, which it has boosted by an average of 12% annually over the last three years.Valero EnergyValero Energy is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO's refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO stock has been a very strong performer over the last year. The stock has more than tripled the returns of its respective industry and trounced the returns of the broad market.Valero Energy earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 186% YoY to $6.62 per share, while current quarter sale are expected to drop -13% to $33.5 billion.Although there have been some slight revisions lower in the current quarter recently, earnings have still been revised considerably higher over the last three months. Furthermore, all other earnings periods have been revised considerably higher, with current year earnings being upgraded by 36%.VLO is trading at a very reasonable 5x one-year forward earnings, which is in line with the industry and well below its five-year median of 13x. VLO also offers a dividend yield of 3.2%, which has been raised by an average of 4.8% annually over the last five years.ConclusionThere has been a major rotation out of energy stocks, yet based on the valuations and improving earnings expectations, they are still compelling investments. While energy prices have been rolling over for the better part of the last year, many of these stocks have held up very well. As uncomfortable as it is sometimes going against can be a profitable endeavor.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

She says it's a great career for anyone who loves learning and being busy.McCaskill graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Central Michigan University. After graduation, she started working in an office doing payroll and accounting, but she quickly found that it wasn't a good fit for her.""I'm far too curious to be at a desk,"" said McCaskill. ""There are only so many ways you can do accounts payable. I need to learn something new every day and be excited every day about what I do.""That being the case, it wasn't long before McCaskill left the office job to start a career in operations. She worked as an operator for the City of Detroit Water Department for 18 years. In 2015, she joined Marathon Petroleum as a field operator and has loved it ever since.""Today, I get the rush that I was looking for in a job,"" said McCaskill. ""I'm constantly using my mind to solve problems, and I learn something new every day. It's exciting and keeps me interested.""As a field operator, McCaskill is responsible for monitoring the equipment that processes crude oil at the refinery. She's checking for potential leaks and issues, communicating with the foreman, writing work requests, and prepping equipment for the maintenance team.""I'm constantly using my mind to solve problems, and I learn something new every day. It's exciting and keeps me interested.""""A major part of my job is to identify problems before they happen,"" said McCaskill. ""I focus on making sure I'm safe, and the people around me are safe. Our team is also focused on making sure that the community around us is safe. We are constantly looking and listening for any changes that need to be addressed.""She acknowledges that it can be labor intensive at times but shared that any woman interested in the field could do this job. She says her co-workers, who are mainly men, do everything possible to make sure she is successful on the job.Story continues""In Complex 2 where I work at the refinery, I have never felt like I couldn't do something,"" said McCaskill. ""My team doesn't even let me ask for help. It starts with ‘we are going to help you.' We trust each other. Everyone brings something to the table, and I bring something different.""She said they all benefit from that type of camaraderie, and they keep safety as their number one priority. McCaskill is also involved in the Women's employee network chapter at the Detroit refinery to help attract, retain, inspire, support and empower other women and allies. She recently volunteered to educate students from the Girls in Engineering Academy in Detroit about engineering when they toured the refinery.Throughout her career, McCaskill has continued her formal education on the side, earning degrees from Oakland Community College and Wayne County Community College. She's currently attending Schoolcraft College in Livonia for the Electronics Technology AAS degree to possibly move into the analyzer/instrumentation group at the refinery.Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Tuesday, March 21, 2023, Press release pictureDynita McCaskillView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745011/Our-People-Field-Operator-Dynita-McCaskill]"

""It was really tough for my parents because they literally came with nothing. They were busy enough trying to put a roof over our heads.""Seeing yourself in othersToday, as a third-year student in the Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Dental Medicine, Arbizu is helping local families in similar circumstances. A $50,000 grant from Marathon Petroleum Corporation's (MPC) Salt Lake City refinery is allowing the school to provide free dental screenings and cleanings twice this year for children and teens 18 and younger from qualifying low-income households. It is the second consecutive year MPC has supported Roseman's outreach through the American Dental Association Foundation's Give Kids a Smile® program.""It's humbling because I see a lot of those kids going through what I went through,"" Arbizu said. ""When you talk to their parents, you realize what it means to those families and see they are so grateful for this access.""Patients also receive vouchers they can use at the school's clinical practice, Roseman Dental, for free comprehensive exams, x-rays, sealants and as much as $100 in additional care and services. During the first event in February, Roseman students served 514 children and teens. The second event is scheduled for Aug. 4.Story continuesFinding your callingArbizu came to dentistry after almost ten years in the financial sector, including time as a bank manager. He was drawn to his new profession by the potential to have an immediate impact in people's lives.""I found dentistry really called to me because of how quickly you can make a difference by giving somebody a new smile. It's huge,"" Arbizu said.The father of three suggested that having a family of his own reinforces his appreciation of the importance of Roseman's services to people in need.""Looking back at my experience, I can only imagine how my parents felt,"" he said. ""It's a privilege to be able to do this.""Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Monday, March 20, 2023, Press release pictureIt's the second consecutive year Marathon's Salt Lake City refinery has supported dental care outreach by the Roseman University of Health Sciences to underserved local families.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/744731/Service-With-a-Smile-Roseman-Dental-Student-Grateful-To-Provide-Free-Care]"

432,933c8abd-342c-337d-8774-56901cdc5a87,TAP,2023-03-23,Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 80%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-beverage-company-nyse-103912861.html,1679395152,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Molson Coors Beverage's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 10 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Molson Coors Beverage. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Molson Coors Beverage?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Molson Coors Beverage already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Molson Coors Beverage, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Molson Coors Beverage is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Dodge &amp; Cox, with ownership of 13%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 7.4% of the stock.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Molson Coors BeverageThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Molson Coors Beverage Company in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$53m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Molson Coors Beverage. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 4.0%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Molson Coors Beverage better, we need to consider many other factors.

435,8260f6df-8c36-34f3-936d-48c752082d7a,AES,2023-03-23,Investors in AES (NYSE:AES) have made a stellar return of 144% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-aes-nyse-aes-made-124535910.html,1679402735,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[While The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 20% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. We think most investors would be happy with the 109% return, over that period. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for AES To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.We know that AES has been profitable in the past. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. So it might be better to look at other metrics to try to understand the share price.The revenue growth of 2.4% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthAES is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for AES the TSR over the last 5 years was 144%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that AES shares lost 0.9% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 11%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 19%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for AES   you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

That’s pretty basic economic, It’s also why utility stocks can be pretty safe bets for investors who are craving a little stability.The stock market had a nasty 2022, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing more than 9%. Tech stocks had it even worse. Those companies, which were long favored by growth investors, helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite down 34%.Things are a little better so far in 2023, but there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUtility stocks are less volatile than other sectors. They’re relatively recession-proof, as everyone needs to have electricity, heat and water. Utility stocks won’t give you the massive growth that you’ll see from the best growth stocks to buy, but you’ll get some stability. And that can be well worth the trade-off.Here are some top utility stocks that are recommended by my Portfolio Grader tool.LNGCheniere Energy$142.29ETEnergy Transfer$11.87ADNAdvent Technologies$1.22AESThe AES Corporation$22.39AMAntero Midstream$9.82AQMSAqua Metals$1.06ARTNAArtesian Resources$51.69Cheniere Energy (LNG)Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comCheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) is a liquified natural gas stock (hence the ticker). The company, which is the largest exporter of LNG in the U.S., made serious money by shipping 70% of its LNG production to Europe in 2022. European customers were badly in need of natural gas after Moscow cut off their supply, in retaliation for the West imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.For the fourth quarter, Cheniere brought in $9.08 billion in revenue, which was 10.1% better than it did in the same quarter a year ago. Net income was nearly $4 billion, and operating income came in at $6.78 billion. Earnings per share came in at $15.78, which was light years ahead of the consensus estimate of $4.89 per share.Story continuesThe Russia-Ukraine war is now at a year and shows no signs of slowing down, so Cheniere’s export business should continue to flourish. The company is also taking care of its shareholders, repurchasing 4.4 million shares in the fourth quarter, and paying a modest dividend as well.LNG stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Energy Transfer (ET)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process.

Its AquaRefining technology allows it to recycle lead without creating pollutants, the company says.Yes, there’s a potentially bright future, but there are also some risks, and investors should tread carefully. Aqua Metals has yet to get to commercial production and therefore had no revenue in 2022. It ended the year with $7.1 million in cash on hand and recorded an operating loss for the year of $15.6 million.Aqua Metals is building its first commercial scale recycling plant that will have a capacity of 3,000 of metric tons of saleable material, potentially bringing in revenue of $60 million. It’s also expecting to receive $12 million in cash this quarter from the sale of a Nevada facility.For now, a bet on Aqua Metals is a bet on the future of lithium-ion products and the global appetite for embracing recycled goods.

It also operates subsidiaries in Maryland and Pennsylvania, supplying more than 8 billion gallons of water a year.Over the last year, Artesian stock is up 14%, but what I like even more about this company is the dividend performance.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.General Motors Company and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that GM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.65, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 51.39. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.57. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.09.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.68. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 13.74.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of C.GM has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSLA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that GM is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In February, the company exceeded 1 million miles driven, joining robotaxi competition Waymo in the 1M club.Per Cruise spokesperson Drew Pusateri, Cruise intends to expand its robotaxi operations throughout California. However, there are no plans to launch services in any specific cities in the near future. If the California DMV approves Cruise's application, the company states its rides will initially be confined to employees only, and additional licenses will be required to expand to customers, whether they are paying or not. California, like many other EV-related developments, appears to be the breeding environment for increased robotaxi operations.General Motors’ strides in autonomous vehicle (AV) development augur well its for long-term growth.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -22.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 13.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share, indicating a change of -26.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.21 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.99 indicates a change of -3.6% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.69 billion and $162.47 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +0.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $43.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.19%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Year to date, Tesla stock is still up +40% to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s +2% with GM’s virtually flat performance trailing the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationSometimes FOMO can have an ill effect on investors decisions to buy stocks. There is always a chance that stocks can start do decline even after rallies and monitoring Tesla and General Motors valuation is important.In this regard, both stocks are startng to look more attractive from a price to earnings perspective with General Motors especially standing out. Shares of GM trade at 5.3X forward earing which is 76% below its decade high of 22.8X and a slight discount to the median of 6.8X. General Motors stock also trades nicely beneath the Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 11.2X, and the S&amp;P 500’s 18X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn comparison, Tesla trades at 45.7X forward earnings. This is well below its extreme decade long high and a 80% discount to the median of 225.81X. Tesla stock does trade above the Automotive-Domestic industry average and the benchmark but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for TSLA shares due to the company’s growth.Story continuesGrowth &amp; OutlookPiggybacking off of Tesla’s growth, earnings are expected to dip -3% this year but rebound and climb 29% in fiscal 2024 at $5.10 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to rise 24% in FY23 and jump anther 21% in FY24 to $122.83 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to General Motors, earnings are projected to drop -18% in FY23 after a better than expected year that saw EPS at $7.59 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip another -3% to $5.99 per share. Sales are forecasted to rise 3% this year and be virtually flat in FY24 at $162.47 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayBoth General Motors and Tesla stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. While there could be more short-term weakness ahead holding on to these stocks at their current levles could be rewarding when considering their P/E valuations relative to their past.This is especially true for Tesla stock when looking at its stellar historical performance, up +7,404% over the last decade to easily top the S&amp;P 500’s +150% and General Motors +19%. With that being said, Tesla and General Motors both provide valuable exposure to the auto industry making their stocks worth holding as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These concerns will be at the front of shareholders' minds as they go into the AGM coming up on 29th of March. One way that shareholders can influence managerial decisions is through voting on CEO and executive remuneration packages, which studies show could impact company performance. In our analysis below, we show why shareholders may consider holding off a raise for the CEO's compensation until company performance improves. See our latest analysis for McCormick How Does Total Compensation For Lawrence Kurzius Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?At the time of writing, our data shows that McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated has a market capitalization of US$19b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$10m for the year to November 2022. We note that's a decrease of 18% compared to last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.3m.For comparison, other companies in the American Food industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$12m. From this we gather that Lawrence Kurzius is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. What's more, Lawrence Kurzius holds US$36m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$1.3mUS$1.3m12%OtherUS$9.2mUS$11m88%Total CompensationUS$10mUS$13m100%On an industry level, roughly 24% of total compensation represents salary and 76% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that McCormick allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated's GrowthOver the last three years, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated has shrunk its earnings per share by 1.4% per year. Revenue was pretty flat on last year.Its a bit disappointing to see that the company has failed to grow its EPS. And the flat revenue is seriously uninspiring. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..Has McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Been A Good Investment?With a total shareholder return of 22% over three years, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated shareholders would, in general, be reasonably content. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.In Summary...While it's true that shareholders have owned decent returns, it's hard to overlook the lack of earnings growth and this makes us question whether these returns will continue. In the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any concerns with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future.CEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. In our study, we found 2 warning signs for McCormick you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.Important note: McCormick is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns.

In 2022, operating expenses increased 27% year over year, mainly due to 78% rise in fuel expenses.The cost hike in fuel was due to steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.

In the December quarter, adjusted operating margin was 10.9%The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 8% in 2022 from 2019 (pre-coronavirus) actuals. Given this buoyant air-travel demand, Delta Air expects total revenues (adjusted) for 2023 to increase in the 15-20% range on a year-over-year basis.Delta Air’s liquidity position is encouraging.

451,f63cd16e-40b5-3614-ae87-0eaf9de0a521,UAL,2023-03-23,United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-inc-ual-130001521.html,1679317201,STORY,['UAL'],"[United Airlines (UAL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned -13.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has lost 11.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.United is expected to post earnings of $0.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +101.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -213.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.23 points to a change of +226.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +10.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.38 indicates a change of +13.9% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For United, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +50.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.98 billion and $55.44 billion estimates indicate +17.9% and +4.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $12.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. EPS of $2.46 for the same period compares with -$1.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.39%. The EPS surprise was +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

456,f8effc24-b522-359a-9cc0-6e3fffdcb19e,PNW,2023-03-23,Investing in Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) three years ago would have delivered you a 41% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-pinnacle-west-capital-nyse-181945549.html,1679336385,STORY,['PNW'],"[Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. For example, the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) share price return of 23% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up just 4.8% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the three years of share price growth, Pinnacle West Capital actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 3.7% per year.Based on these numbers, we think that the decline in earnings per share may not be a good representation of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it makes sense to look into other metrics.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield. On top of that, revenue grew at a rate of 7.3% per year, and it's likely investors interpret that as pointing to a brighter future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Pinnacle West Capital's TSR for the last 3 years was 41%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Pinnacle West Capital shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.9% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Pinnacle West Capital better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Pinnacle West Capital (including 1 which is potentially serious) .If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

You must ask, “Why is this stock selling off and what does the future likely hold for this stock?”Often the stock is part of an out-of-favor sector for one reason or another. Such is the case with real estate investment trusts (REITs), which have struggled as inflation has pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates several times.Take a look at one REIT whose share price has taken a beating over the past few weeks and see whether now is a good time to purchase it for a long-term hold.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with 194 properties concentrated in the six largest cities from Boston to Seattle. The firm calls itself “the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.” Its 54.1 million square feet of space is 88.6% leased with a weighted-average lease term of 7.7 years. Many of its properties are rated as premier quality and located in highly desirable areas of the cities.Last year was difficult for Boston Properties, and its total return was negative 40.39%. This year has been much the same story, with a total return of negative 23.3% as of March 17.Office REITs have been extremely volatile. January was a great month for the office subsector as a whole, and Boston Properties was up 11.89%. But the share price peaked on Feb. 2, and it’s been downhill since. Fears of recession and increasing office vacancies have weighed heavily on Boston Properties.Boston Properties has demonstrated a stable, if not exciting, dividend history. The dividend has grown 22.5% over the past five years and was never cut during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the dividend has not increased since December 2019.The 52-week range on Boston Properties is $50.18 to $133.11. Shares hit 52-week lows this past week and could go even lower this week. Does it make sense to try to grab a bargain now, or is Boston Properties the proverbial “falling knife” that needs more time to bottom before it’s safe to purchase? Here are some recent developments.Story continuesOn Jan. 31, Boston Properties reported fourth-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of $1.86, up 20% from $1.55 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2 cents above Wall Street estimates. Revenue of $789.8 million was 8% higher than $731.06 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $15.54 million ahead of expectations.Forward guidance on first-quarter 2023 FFO in a range from $1.66 to $1.68 was below the consensus of $1.76 and full-year 2023 FFO guidance of $7.08 to $7.18 was less than the $7.21 consensus and below the previous full-year guidance of $7.15 to $7.30.Analysts’ views on Boston Properties have been mixed as well. In early January, Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the REIT from Buy to Hold, while reducing the price target from $91 to $74. On March 16, Wells Fargo lowered its price target on Boston Properties from $76 to $64, while maintaining its Overweight rating on the stock.But on Feb. 3, Morgan Stanley analyst Ronald Kamdem raised his price target on Boston Properties from $65 to $68, while maintaining an Equal-Weight rating on the shares. And on March 17, Ford Equity Research upgraded its rating on Boston Properties from 3 to 2.There have also been some positive recent developments. On March 15, Boston Properties Director Matthew J. Lustig purchased 10,000 shares of Boston Properties stock for $529,200. The share price is now lower than what the insider paid.On March 20, Boston Properties announced that its board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share payable on April 28 to shareholders of record as of the close on March 31. This was in line with the previous quarterly dividend. The present annual dividend of $3.92 now yields 7.67%.Despite the negative views on office REITs and the falling share price, the board did not cut the dividend, and at least one company insider is now buying shares.Technically, the stock looks very oversold, with the 14-period relative strength index (RSI) at 20 and the stochastic at 12. But the stock has been falling on heavy volume for the past week.Adding it all up, it seems that the share price may have a little bit further to fall, but Boston Properties seems to be reaching a selling climax that could render it a terrific long-term bargain before first-quarter earnings are announced on May 1. Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $1.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Westrock shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Westrock is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Beverages - Soft drinks industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

In 2022, operating expenses increased 27% year over year, mainly due to 78% rise in fuel expenses.The cost hike in fuel was due to steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.

For more cruise stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now.  One of the hardest hit sectors by the coronavirus pandemic was the cruise ship industry. While other hospitality sectors, such as hotels and restaurants had time to prepare to deal with lockdown requirements aimed to curb the spread of the virus, cruise companies were simply caught off guard. This is due to the fact that as lockdowns started to be enforced, many cruise ships were in the middle of their journeys, and were often left stranded at sea due to port and harbor closures. In fact, a little known fact about the pandemic is that one of the most widespread coronavirus outbreaks after China in fact took place on a cruise ship. This ship was the Diamond Princess which has more than a thousand guest cabins and roughly the same number of crews.The ill fated vessel began its journey in late January and saw its passenger and crew count swell to almost four thousand people. All of these were left stranded at the Tokyo harbor in Japan for almost a month after initial reports surfaced that two elderly passengers that had gotten off the ship in Hong Kong had tested positive for the deadly virus. Matters took a serious turn when ten passengers on board the Diamond Princess tested positive and the ship remained in limbo stuck at Tokyo for 27 days, with 14 passengers dying and 712 becoming infected.However, the Diamond Princess was not the only ship stuck due to the virus. According to a Guardian investigation, more than one hundred thousand cruise ship crew members were left stranded at sea due to the virus, and many of them would die in the waters as well. In terms of economic costs, research from Russian maritime universities show that they are simply unbelievable. The researchers point out that between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of the first quarter of 2020, cruise companies saw their profits drop from $30 billion to just $50 million, for an almost complete decimation. The pandemic also put several companies out of business, as the total number of cruise companies dropped from 93 to 81 as the virus wreaked havoc all over the world.Story continuesThe pandemic also shook the perception of the cruise liner industry. A natural language processing (NLP) analysis of the tweets related to the industry conducted by researchers in Spain showed that the majority of sentiment surrounding the industry was negative. The analysis revealed that widespread media coverage of the pandemic combined with previously held beliefs about the cruise industry as being a 'petri dish' for diseases contributed significantly to negative sentiment, and it cautioned that this sentiment can continue even as the pandemic settles and life goes back to normal. Since this raises the question of whether people would be willing to take a cruise after the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, brief research reveals that researchers from the U.K. and Australia try to answer these very questions. By using a questionnaire through a research panel, they determined that risk perceptions related to cruise traveling were based on the participants' home country, with respondents from Australia having a more negative outlook when compared to those from the U.K. It also found out that the coronavirus pandemic was unique in the sense that it led to an experience agnostic perception about the future intention to take a cruise, which was in opposition to previous viruses that had seen people with previous cruise ship experiences having more positive intentions.With the worst behind it, a research report from Grand View Market Research estimates that the global cruise market was worth $7.25 billion in 2021 and that it grew to $7.67 billion in 2022. It adds that from 2022 onwards, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2022 to 2028 to sit at $15 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm adds that within the market, the river cruise segment will be the fastest growing and that it will outpace the broader industry by growing at 13.3%. According to Grand View Market Research, the ocean cruise segment was the largest segment in the market in 2021, as it accounted for 80% of the total revenues.After the coronavirus bloodbath, the industry is well on its way to recovery, with the chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), Mr. Jason Liberty, outlining during a recent earnings call in February 2023:We finished 2022 on a high note and are entering 2023 with the full strength of our operating and commercial platforms.

I am incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well on our mission of delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly and building the foundation for our future growth.

Our products appeal to a broad range of vacationers with everything from a short getaway to Perfect Day to a luxury world cruise. Cruising remains an exceptionally attractive value proposition.

(NYSE:RCL) share price down 16% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been very strong. In three years the stock price has launched 118% higher: a great result. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.5%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises Royal Caribbean Cruises wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.In the last 3 years Royal Caribbean Cruises saw its revenue shrink by 23% per year. So the share price gain of 30% per year is quite surprising. It's fair to say shareholders are definitely counting on a bright future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Royal Caribbean Cruises shareholders are down 19% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 11%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

These ICs can detect and cancel common-mode EMI in power systems such as AC/DC power supplies, on-board chargers, servers and UPS. This then allows designers to reduce the size of chokes by 50%.The new ICs help engineers boost system functionality at a reduced cost, while meeting EMI regulatory standards.Given the benefits and useful features, we believe that Texas Instruments will gain solid momentum across automotive, enterprise, aerospace and industrial applications on the back of its latest move.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and Consensus Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and ConsensusTexas Instruments Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteAnalog Segment in FocusWith the new IC family, Texas Instruments strengthens its power management and power supply offerings, bolstering the analog segment.Notably, the analog segment is integral to Texas Instruments, as it generates the majority of its total revenues.In the fourth quarter of 2022, the segment generated $3.6 billion revenues, accounting for 76.2% of the total revenues.Therefore, Texas Instruments’ growing efforts toward expanding the analog segment are likely to continue driving its financial performance in the near and long terms.This, in turn, will instill investor optimism in the stock.Coming to the price performance, TXN has lost 0.7% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 10%.Story continuesExpanding PortfolioThe latest move is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its overall product portfolio.Apart from the introduction of the IC family, TXN recently unveiled the battery cell monitor, BQ79718-Q1, and battery pack monitor, BQ79731-Q1, which are designed for electric vehicles.BQ79718-Q1 and BQ79731-Q1 are designed to maximize the drive time of an EV and ensure safer operation with such a strong measurement capability.Further, the company introduced device-screening specifications called space high-grade plastic (SHP) and SHP-compatible analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), namely ADC12DJ5200-SP and ADC12QJ1600-SP.TXN also bolstered its radiation-tolerant Space Enhanced Plastic portfolio with a new family of pulse-width modulation (PWM) controllers, namely TPS7H5005-SEPz.Additionally, it launched ultrasonic lens cleaning semiconductors named the ULC1001 digital signal processor and companion DRV2901 piezo transducer driver.With the new ultrasonic lens cleaning chipsets, TXN focuses on improving system accuracy and, thereby, reducing maintenance requirements.Also, the company introduced a radar sensor called AWR2944 to strengthen its presence in the booming ADAS market.

485,6029f22a-6d8d-38af-bfc0-0fbd2550e11b,ADI,2023-03-23,"Why Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-110026441.html,1679310026,STORY,['ADI'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Analog Devices’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices What Is Analog Devices Worth?Analog Devices appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 27.41x is currently well-above the industry average of 18x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Analog Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Analog Devices look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Analog Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 21%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ADI should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADI for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ADI, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Digital Currency and Payments Stocks to Buy Now. One aspect of our daily lives that has completely transformed over the past decade or so is payments. The advent of the smartphone and the rise of the internet has brought everyone's bank account right at their fingertips and created new digital wallets where money is stored on the Internet. This enables everyday users to use their smartphones to pay for a wide variety of goods and services and increases the convenience offered to them in their daily lives.This growth in digital payments isn't only a characteristic of the developed world. In fact, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic spurred growth in the digital payments market as it accelerated a shift to online platforms. This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4.

In France and Poland, the percentage of people using digital methods for money transfers stood at 62-67%.This highlights the urgency of businesses in the money remittance space to innovate and adapt to changing times, as the future of digital money transfer is inevitable.Why the Rush?The answer to this lies in the certainty and security of digital transactions.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Visa (NYSE:V), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Visa How Quickly Is Visa Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Visa managed to grow EPS by 9.6% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Visa achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 18% to US$30b.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$236m. This comes in at 0.05% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Visa is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership.

As the amount of global remittance inflows continues to reach new records1, 53% of surveyed consumers are turning to digital apps to send and receive funds around the world.Visa today unveiled its ""Money Travels: 2023 Digital Remittances Adoption"" research report, a survey of over 14,000 consumers across ten countries, revealing that digital remittances are quickly becoming the most popular way to move money internationally, when compared to going to a physical bank or branch (34%); sending cash, checks or money orders by mail (12%); or giving money to another person who is traveling to their home country (11%).In conjunction with the study, Visa launched ""Money Travels,"" a new podcast series unearthing how payment-related topics unfold differently in various places around the world and highlighting the stories of real people, payment experts and partners.""Fast, easy and secure payments can make a profound difference to families, communities and economies around the world,"" said Ruben Salazar, Global Head of Visa Direct. ""This new research shows incredible acceleration of digital payments, but there is still more the industry can do to bring streamlined remittances within reach for more migrant workers and their families who rely on these lifeline payments to do everything from pay for food, education, or even unforeseen medical costs.""The Money Travels: 2023 Digital Remittances Adoption study examines how consumers send money abroad, diving into the rates, methods, and reasons for sending and receiving these lifeline payments. Highlights include:Story continuesDigital remittances are the preferred method amongst surveyed consumers across all surveyed countries. 60-70% of surveyed remittance users across North America have used an app-based digital payment method to send/receive money internationally, whereas only 10-15% of surveyed U.S. remittance users rely on cash, checks, and money orders. Similarly, sending money through digital apps is the most popular method for 69% and 65% of surveyed consumers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, compared to digital from a physical location, cash, or check.Adoption of app-based digital payments is high, with low barriers to usage. Three-quarters of surveyed remittance senders in Mexico and Peru have used app-based digital payment methods, while two-thirds of recipients have used an app. Additionally, in Europe, 62-67% of surveyed consumers across France and Poland who have sent international remittances have used digital methods.Remitter pain points include but are not limited to high fees and issues with calculating exchange rates. In total, 38% of surveyed consumers on the send side in the United Arab Emirates report fees being too high when sending digital remittances, and 37% of surveyed consumers on the send side in Singapore report issues with calculating the exchange rates.App-based digital payments are considered the most secure method by a strong proportion of remittance users across countries. In Singapore, a key remittance country on the send side, three out of five (61%) surveyed consumers reported using digital-only means for sending money internationally thanks to ease of use and security (53%).Rates of sending and receiving remittances vary widely by country. Of the countries surveyed, Poland, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines receive remittances at higher rates than sending them. France and Singapore see higher send rates.Sending more money, more often, is easier than ever. Over half of those who have sent money internationally do so about once per month or more often in the United Arab Emirates (71%), Saudi Arabia (64%) and the Philippines (48%). Among those who have received money 80% do so at least a few times per year in Saudi Arabia, followed by the Philippines (77%), and Mexico (72%).Visa works in collaboration with global remitters such as Brightwell, Maya Philippines, MoneyGram, Paysend, Remitly, Western Union and Xoom to help enable efficient money movement through digitized remittances. ""One of our visions for Visa Direct is to create new opportunities for financial inclusion and wealth building by helping to simplify cross-border payments and streamline the way money travels,"" continued Ruben Salazar.A new ""The Connective Power of Remittances"" Nonstop Guide explores the rise of digital remittances, the tales behind these types of payments and how the digital revolution is helping streamline remittance payments.

The Realtor.com® February Rental Report found that despite a slight decrease in rent prices, affordability continued to get worse in 26 major metros.In February, the median rent in the 50 largest metros declined to $1,716, down $1 from last month and $48 from the peak. However, rents are still up 3.1% from one year ago, making rental payments less affordable. Renters earning the typical household income devoted 25.3% of their income to lease a typical for-rent home, up from 24.8% a year ago.""The general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't spend more than 30% of your income on housing, but the data shows that in eight of the 50 largest metros, many renters are doing just that,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Slowing rental price growth is a positive for renters, but it's important to put this in context. This means that affordability is worsening at a slower pace in many markets; it's not getting better.""The pace of rent growth has slowed for the past 13 months and experienced single-digit growth for the past seven months. Despite this, rent prices are still $296 (20.8%) higher than the same time in 2020 (pre-pandemic).Least affordable rental markets in Feb. 2023:Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla. – $2,349 or 42.3% of incomeLos Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif. – $2,864 or 39.2% of incomeNew York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa. – $2,895 or 37.5% of incomeSan Diego-Carlsbad, Calif. – $2,844 or 36.6% of incomeRiverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. – $2,145 or 32.5% of incomeBoston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H. – $2,829 or 32.0% of incomeOrlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla. – $1,769 or 31.1% of incomeTampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla. – $1,691 or 31.1% of incomeStory continuesHead inland to find affordabilityAll eight of the most rent-burdened metros are located along the coast with Fla. (three markets) and Calif. (three markets) leading the pack. On the other hand, the American Heartland led the way in terms of affordability. Oklahoma City, Okla. was the most affordable rental market in February with residents paying 17.4% of income on rent, followed by Columbus, Ohio (18.2%), Minneapolis, Minn.

Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). With the release of its February rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since February 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.Rental affordability analysis: The affordable monthly rent is calculated by applying the 30% rule to the estimated 2023 monthly median household income nationwide ($6,793 across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average) and in each metro. The monthly median household income is derived from the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas. Due to the methodology changes noted, Realtor.com has made historical revisions to its prior affordability analyses. For our most recently published affordability analysis on August 2022 data published in September 2022, the national rent-to-income share has been updated to 26.2%.  *See report for fully detailed methodologyAbout Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The 12 months project would bring broadband to these addresses by spring 2024.Located in one of Bedford County’s broadband coverage gaps, these locations were not connected during a 2019 Virginia Telecommunication Initiative (VATI) project and are not identified for any other publicly funded broadband project.“Verizon is focused on delivering broadband service, and the economic benefits associated with it, for our customers and employees in Central Virginia,” said Kwame Trotman, Vice President of Wireline Network Operations-Mid-Atlantic South Region for Verizon. “We are pleased to work with Bedford County to achieve our common goal of increasing broadband access for unserved and underserved areas in the State. This project will significantly help to close the digital divide in that region.”To bring broadband to residents quicker, county officials made a proactive choice to finance the project directly with American Rescue Plan funds versus applying for another VATI grant for these locations.“The Bedford County Board of Supervisors has a continued commitment to working with multiple partners to bring broadband to all areas of Bedford County,” said Edgar Tuck, Chair of the Bedford County Board of Supervisors. “We are very appreciative of Verizon’s commitment to delivering quality service to our residents in this area.”“We applaud the Bedford County Board of Supervisors and the County’s professional staff for their leadership in establishing this robust broadband program in Central Virginia,” said Thomas Walls, Director - Virginia State &amp; Local Government Affairs at Verizon. “This partnership will expand high-speed broadband access to many residents and will better connect our communities.”Story continuesIn an effort to provide connectivity to families in need across the country, Verizon participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)1 a U.S. government program run by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to help low-income households pay for internet service. With ACP eligibility and the Verizon Forward Program2, customers can get free home internet service – no hidden fees or annual contracts, and no equipment charges or data caps.

Previous CEOs, including three-time CEO Howard Shultz, James Donald, Orin C. Smith, and Kevin Johnson, all held positions at the company prior to taking the helm. Narasimhan joined Starbucks October 1 as interim CEO with plans to officially begin his role and join the Starbucks' Board of Directors on April 1, 2023, making his CEO transition two weeks earlier than initially planned.Four days into his role as the official CEO and ahead of the company's annual meeting of the shareholders, Narasimhan sent a letter to its employees (or what Starbucks calls partners).In the letter, he emphasized his focus on ""long-term sustainable growth,"" which includes finding ways to elevate the brand, build on Starbuck's ""leadership position,"" strengthen customers' digital experience, and grow the brand's global presence.He also noted that he plans to focus on employees. ""Critically, we will reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks,"" he said.This comes after more than 100 stores went on strike Wednesday to ""demand basic rights"" and ""welcome"" Laxman whom they say has an ""opportunity"" to stop ""union busting,"" per the labor union Starbucks Workers United.Narasimhan also said in the letter that he plans to ""continue working in stores for a half day each month, to keep us close to the culture and our customers.""So, who is Laxman Narasimhan?Known as ""Laks"" to baristas, the 55-year-old business executive was born in 1967 in the town Pune, India, where went on to earn a degree in engineering. He then earned a Master's degree in international studies and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania. He reportedly speaks six languages; German, English, Spanish, and three Indian dialects.Story continuesNarasimhan began his career at the consulting firm McKinsey, becoming a senior partner. There, he spent 19 years focused on consumer, retail, and technology practices across the U.S. and Asia.In 2012, he left the firm to join PepsiCo (PEP). There, he held various roles, including global chief commercial officer, where he oversaw the beverage giant's long-term strategy and digital capabilities. His other titles at PepsiCo included CEO of the company’s operations in Latin America, Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa.Then in September of 2019, he got tapped to be CEO of Reckitt Benckiser (RKT.L). There, he was credited with boosting sales of health and hygiene products during the pandemic as well as leading the company through the baby formula shortage in the U.S. As mentioned in the video above, following his first day as Reckitt CEO to the day after he announced his departure in September 2022, the company's stock price was up 8%. Upon his announced departure, shares fell more than 4%.Narasimhan is also a Verizon (VZ) board member, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a trustee of the Brookings Institution, and served on the Board of Reckitt during his tenure as CEO.SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - SEPTEMBER 13, 2022: CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz back stage with soon to be Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan at Starbucks Headquarters during Investor Day in Seattle, Washington Tuesday September 13, 2022. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Narasimhan has a lot on his plate as the new CEO of Starbucks. As noted earlier, his tenure also kicks off as the company continues to tussle with unionization efforts by employees who don't believe they are being given a seat at the table.Though no longer CEO, former CEO Howard Schultz is scheduled to testify before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee on Wednesday, March 29, in response to accusations that Starbucks has not allowed its workers to ""organize unions,"" nor engaged ""in collective bargaining to improve their wages and working conditions,"" according to a statement from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.Other items on Narasimhan's agenda include implementing the company's accelerated growth strategy, what it calls the Reinvention Plan, expansion into China and curbside delivery there, and the rollout of the olive-oil infused coffee line Oleato, among others.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$33b ÷ (US$380b - US$50b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Telecom industry average of 6.5% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Verizon Communications, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 10%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Verizon Communications' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications   you'll probably want to know about.While Verizon Communications isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:TPR), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Tapestry’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Tapestry What Is Tapestry Worth?Good news, investors! Tapestry is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $64.08, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Tapestry’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Tapestry look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Tapestry's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TPR is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TPR for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TPR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:Total S&amp;P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are expected to be down -9.4% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% decline in the preceding period's earnings (2022 Q4) on +5.8% higher revenues.Estimates for the period have been coming down over the last few months, with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors suffering negative revisions since the start of the quarter.In terms of growth, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Basic Materials (-39.2% decline), Construction (-32%), Medical (-22.5%), Conglomerates (-23.8%), Autos (-17.8%), Technology (-16.4%), and Consumer Staples (-9.2%) having notable declines.Sectors enjoying positive earnings growth in 2023 Q1 include Transportation (+55%), Aerospace (+19.4%), Energy (+6.8%), Utilities (+0.4%), Finance (+2.6%), Industrial Products (+0.8%), and Consumer Discretionary (+14.9%).The Tech sector has gotten off to a great start in 2023, handily outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index in the year-to-date period. While Tech stocks have lost ground over the last few weeks, the Zacks Tech sector is still up +17.7% in the year-to-date period vs. the +5.2% gain for the market as a whole.This came after a tough year for the group in 2022 when Tech stocks were big-time losers. The Zacks Tech sector lost -36.2% of its value in calendar year 2022, clearly underperforming the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.7% decline.Story continuesThese stocks' recent positive follow through has a lot to do with the market's evolving expectations of an end to the Fed's tightening cycle. This view has faced its own share of ups and downs since the start of the year, but uncertainty about the banking industry revived its fortunes.Higher interest rates resulting from the hawkish Fed posture are a big headwind for these 'long-duration' stocks, a big portion of whose value comes from profitability in future years.The onset of monetary policy headwinds last year coincided with the group adjusting to the post-Covid world. As we all know, Tech companies were big beneficiaries of Covid-related disruptions.The post-Covid adjustment view posits that the 2021 jump in the group's earnings brought forward profitability from future years. As you can see in the above two charts, the market expects this 'adjustment' to last through this year, with 'regular' growth resuming next year.The Tech sector's earnings outlook has been weighed down by the combined effects of post-Covid adjustment and softening demand as a result of the Fed tightening.As noted earlier, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates for the group have been cut more than -23% since April last year. The magnitude of cuts to some of the major players in the space such as Alphabet GOOGL, Meta META, Nvidia NVDA and others is even more pronounced.For example, Alphabet is currently expected to bring in $5.12 per share on $247.06 billion in revenues in 2023, representing year-over-year changes of +5.6% and +12.3%, respectively. The current $5.12 per share estimate is modestly down from a month back, but it is actually up +1.6% over the last two months. Full-year 2023 estimates for Nvidia have increased +1.8% over the last two months, while the same for Meta have jumped +31.8% over the same time period.The Earnings Big PictureFor the current period (2023 Q1), S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to decline -9.4% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues.As has been the case over the few quarters, estimates for 2023 Q1 have been steadily coming down.Please note that the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates is relatively lower compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the last few quarters.As noted earlier, the current aggregate earnings total for the index approximates to an index 'EPS' of $215.20, down from $242.98 in mid-April, 2022.Expectations for the Coming PeriodsAs mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -14% since mid-April 2022. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after more companies report quarterly results and provide guidance. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy's foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.65% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.63%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 6.65%.Coming into today, shares of the prescription drug distributor had lost 3.88% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 1.27%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McKesson as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $7.14, up 22.47% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $67.93 billion, up 2.77% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $25.93 per share and revenue of $275.74 billion. These totals would mark changes of +9.46% and +4.46%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for McKesson. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. McKesson is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that McKesson has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.4 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 19.95, which means McKesson is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that MCK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.29. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Medical - Dental Supplies was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.06 at yesterday's closing price.The Medical - Dental Supplies industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, which puts it in the top 23% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intel's shares have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-39.8% vs. -9.7%). The company is facing a challenging macroeconomic environment, uncertain business conditions and softening demand trends are likely to remain an overhang on Intel's performance. In addition, production delays remain a concern.Imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden are other headwinds. Intensifying competition, inflated raw material costs and signs of market saturation are worrisome.However, Intel is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market. Healthy traction from Mobileye's technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management are tailwinds.(You can read the full research report on Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of MercadoLibre have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+39.2% vs. -9.7%). The company is benefiting from strength in the commerce and fintech businesses. Robust product offerings and credit portfolio expansion are respectively driving the company's commerce and fintech revenues.Further, robust mobile-point-of-sale business and growing adoption of MercadoPago are driving the total payment volume growth of the company. Our estimate suggests that the total payment volume is likely to witness a 30% rise in the current year from last year's figure.Also, rapid adoption of Mobile Wallet remains a positive. Further, robust shipment growth via MercadoEnvios is another positive.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Air Products and Chemicals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is:16% = US$2.3b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Air Products and Chemicals seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 16%. This certainly adds some context to Air Products and Chemicals' moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing Air Products and Chemicals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Air Products and Chemicals is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Air Products and Chemicals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 63% (or a retention ratio of 37%) for Air Products and Chemicals suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Air Products and Chemicals has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 53%. However, Air Products and Chemicals' ROE is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Air Products and Chemicals' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Today's event will begin at 8:00 a.m. ET and will be available through a live webcast and replay at the company's investor relations website.GPC Logo. (PRNewsFoto/Genuine Parts Company)During today's event, the company will highlight actions it has taken to streamline its business into a global service-orientated distribution company serving the automotive and industrial aftermarkets. The company will also discuss its key initiatives and strategic investments, which are focused around five foundational pillars: talent and culture; sales effectiveness; technology; supply chain; and emerging technology.""We are building on our strong momentum and investing in our businesses to create value and unlock the power of One GPC,"" said Paul Donahue, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our rich culture, global scale and strategic execution provide us with unique opportunities for profitable growth and strong cash flow, and we are excited for the future of Genuine Parts Company.""2023 OutlookToday, the company reaffirmed its full-year 2023 financial guidance provided February 23, 2023.Year Ending 12/31/2023Total sales growth4% to 6%Automotive sales growth4% to 6%Industrial sales growth4% to 6%Diluted earnings per share$8.80 to $8.95Adjusted diluted earnings per share$8.80 to $8.95Effective tax rateApprox. 25%Net cash provided by operating activities$1.2 billion to $1.4 billionFree cash flow$800 million to $1.0 billionLong-Term Financial TargetsToday, the company provided its 2025 financial outlook as follows:Year Ending 12/31/2025Total sales$26.5 billion to $27.0 billionEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ((""EBITDA"")$2.65 billion to $2.75 billionDiluted earnings per share (""EPS"")$11.00 to $11.50For the 3-Year Period1/1/2023 – 12/31/2025Compounded annual sales growth (""CAGR"") 6.0% to 7.0%Compounded annual EPS CAGR 10.0% to 11.0%Cumulative free cash flow$2.6 billion to $2.8 billion Non-GAAP InformationThis release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States (""U.S."") generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). These items include adjusted diluted earnings per common share, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") and free cash flow. The company believes that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per common share, EBITDA and free cash flow, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company's core operations. The company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures are useful and enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the company's core operations. The company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include acquisition-related costs, litigation charges or settlements, impairment charges, and certain other unusual adjustments.Story continuesEBITDAEBITDA is key metric we use to assess the underlying profitability of our business operations. It is calculated as net income before the effects of certain net expenses that directly arise from our financing decisions (interest), tax strategies (income taxes) and capital investment decisions (depreciation, amortization). We use EBITDA to forecast our performance, evaluate our actual results against our forecasts and compare our results to others in the industries that we serve. EBITDA is also a measure of performance included in our executive incentive compensation plans. This is a metric that is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is key metric we use to assess how much cash we generate from operations in a period, after funding maintenance and strategic capital expense initiatives. We use Free Cash Flow to determine how effective we are at generating cash to fund other investing and financing priorities, including making strategic mergers and acquisitions, repaying debts, issuing dividends, and buying back shares. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. This is a metric that is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry.About Genuine Parts Company Founded in 1928, Genuine Parts Company is a global service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive and industrial replacement parts.

The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.” Click to continue reading and see Mario Gabelli's Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None.

544,d190b082-c715-3b53-b5b7-10fd096a72c0,FOX,2023-03-23,"Fox, Dominion argue over legal standards to prove defamation",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-dominion-argue-over-legal-200318135.html,1679515398,STORY,['FOXA'],"[WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Lawyers for Fox News and a voting machine company tangled Wednesday over the high bar to prove defamation in a $1.6 billion lawsuit that has embarrassed the conservative network over its airing of false claims related to the 2020 presidential election.The argument is at the heart of each side's attempt to persuade a Delaware judge that he should grant summary judgment in its favor and avoid a jury trial scheduled to start next month that would focus in part on media protections afforded in a nearly six-decade-old libel standard.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems claims that Fox program hosts, with the knowledge of executives for both Fox News and parent company Fox Corp., repeatedly allowed allies of former President Donald Trump to falsely claim that the machines and the software the company used were responsible for Trump’s election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn’t believe the claims but aired them anyway.Fox contends that it can't be held liable for defamation for simply reporting on newsworthy allegations — a sitting president’s claim that the election was being stolen from him.Fox attorney Erin Murphy argued Wednesday that the parent company cannot be held “vicariously liable” simply because Fox Corp. executives, including chairman Rupert Murdoch, might have had knowledge of who was appearing on Fox shows and sometimes communicated with Fox News officials.“Fox Corp. doesn’t belong in the case at all,” she said.Murphy also argued that Dominion cannot demonstrate that anyone at Fox Corp. acted with actual malice without first proving that that person directly participated in any of 17 programs that aired between Nov. 8, 2020, and Jan. 26, 2021, in which the allegedly defamatory statements were made. In addition to the programs, Dominion is claiming that three tweets from former Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs were defamatory.Story continuesDobbs repeatedly offered a platform for Trump lawyer Sidney Powell to make unproven allegations about Dominion. Murphy argued that Dobbs often went “out of his way” to acknowledge evidence on the other side and explained why he had doubts. He also offered several invitations for Dominion representatives to appear on his show but was always turned down, Murphy said.“I don’t think that’s consistent with actual malice,” she said.Her comments came one day after Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Fox appeared to have “a Dobbs problem.”Stephen Shackelford Jr., an attorney for Dominion, said Fox can't escape the fact that Powell, during a Nov. 13, 2020, Dobbs program, made a clearly false statement that Dominion was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for late president Hugo Chavez.“Fox viewers don’t expect Dobbs to bring liars on to his show to lie to them,” Shackelford said.“Sidney Powell was hunting for somebody to make her relevant, and Fox made her relevant,” he added.The two-day summary judgment hearing was perhaps the most significant court action to date in a lawsuit that already has revealed Fox personalities’ private disdain for Trump and illustrated how political pressures can inform its coverage. The case also holds the potential for redefining libel law in the U.S.Dominion attorneys say Fox employees allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes from Trump to Joe Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Chavez, and offered bribes or kickbacks to government officials who used its machines.Fox attorneys argue that the key issue is not whether the allegations were true or false, but whether it was accurately reporting the allegations. They also argue that there is a critical distinction between a factual statement and an opinion.“Despite the noise and confusion that Dominion has generated by presenting cherry-picked quotes without context, this case is ultimately about the First Amendment protections of the media’s absolute need to cover the news,"" Fox News said in a prepared statement Wednesday.Dominion said in a statement that it is “a strong believer in the First Amendment and its protections.”“As long-settled law makes clear, the First Amendment does not shield broadcasters that knowingly or recklessly spread lies,” the statement added.]"

The trial is due to start on April 17.In 2021, Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News, accusing them of destroying its reputation by airing false claims by former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. Fox has argued that coverage of these claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press.Dominion has said Fox News knew that allegations were false but continued putting the claims on the air anyway in pursuit of ratings.

549,8e0942b3-4acc-360c-b132-537b84ce451d,FOX,2023-03-23,UPDATE 5-Fox faces skeptical judge in Dominion defamation suit,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fox-dominion-pursue-pretrial-135746827.html,1679407066,STORY,['FOXA'],"[(Recasts with Fox presentation to judge)By Jack Queen and Helen CosterWILMINGTON, Delaware, March 21 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Fox Corp faced a skeptical judge on Tuesday as they sought to block a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems from going to trial, while the voting-technology company accused Fox News of knowingly airing vote-rigging claims that the network knew were false.Both sides made presentations during a hearing in Wilmington before Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, asking him to rule in their favor on various legal questions rather than proceeding to a full trial scheduled to start on April 17.The judge peppered a Fox lawyer with questions about its defense against Dominion's assertion that the network knew that allegations by former President Donald Trump and his lawyers of vote-rigging in the 2020 U.S. election were false but continued putting the claims on the air anyway in pursuit of ratings.Dominion argues that this meets the ""actual malice"" standard to win a defamation case under which a plaintiff must prove a defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Fox lawyer Erin Murphy disagreed.Fox's lawyers also invoked the legal doctrine of ""neutral reportage,"" which holds that the press cannot be held liable for publishing newsworthy allegations in a neutral way.Davis said there was tension between Fox's arguments on ""actual malice"" and ""neutral reportage.""""To me, it doesn't seem intellectually honest that you apply actual malice and say there's neutral reporting privilege,"" Davis said, adding: ""How can you be neutral if you're knowingly doing false things?""Murphy sought to provide context for the defamatory statements alleged by Dominion and argued that reasonable viewers understood that the claims aired on Fox News were mere allegations. The Fox News statements cited by Dominion included a Twitter post by former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs that included pro-Trump hashtags.Story continues""You're saying he's a neutral reporter?"" Davis asked Murphy, who responded that Dobbs was not being neutral in his support for Trump but did not write the hashtag #DominionVoterFraud.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by airing false claims by Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. Fox has argued that coverage of these claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of press freedom.It is one of the most closely watched defamation cases involving a major U.S. media organization in years, pitting the influential cable news network that features conservative commentators against a company that claims Fox's coverage destroyed its business.Both sides are seeking summary judgment - asking the judge to decide the case in their favor before it goes to a jury trial. Davis said he does not plan to rule from the bench and will issue a written opinion sometime later. The hearing is due to resume on Wednesday.'RELEASE THE KRAKEN'In their presentation to the judge, Dominion's lawyers said internal Fox communications prove that the network repeatedly hosted guests who it knew were peddling ""reckless"" and ""completely crazy"" falsehoods because it was losing viewers to far-right media competitors.""They chose to let the story be out there - to let out the hoax, to release the Kraken,"" lawyer Rodney Smolla said, referring to a nickname for Sidney Powell, who was a lawyer for Trump. ""And why? Because Fox viewers were abandoning Fox.""Davis seemed particularly interested in whether 20 allegedly defamatory statements cited by Dominion were facts, opinions or a mix of the two. He also sought clarity on Dominion's legal theories.""Are you saying that Fox adopts Trump's statements just because the president said at a press conference that the election was a hoax?"" Davis asked.Lawyer Justin Nelson answered no, saying Dominion's allegation is that Fox knew Trump's lawyers were going to make false claims but hosted them on its shows anyway.Separately, a Fox News producer filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing the network's lawyers of pressuring her to provide misleading testimony in the Dominion case.Abby Grossberg, who was head of booking for Fox News host Tucker Carlson, said coaching and intimidation by Fox lawyers before her deposition left her ""feeling pressured not to name names or to implicate others, in particular prominent male on-air personalities and Fox News executives.""Fox said in a statement on Tuesday that Grossberg's ""allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless and we will vigorously defend Fox against all of her claims.""(Reporting by Jack Queen in Wilmington and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Will Dunham and Amy Stevens)]"

For more cruise stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now.  One of the hardest hit sectors by the coronavirus pandemic was the cruise ship industry. While other hospitality sectors, such as hotels and restaurants had time to prepare to deal with lockdown requirements aimed to curb the spread of the virus, cruise companies were simply caught off guard. This is due to the fact that as lockdowns started to be enforced, many cruise ships were in the middle of their journeys, and were often left stranded at sea due to port and harbor closures. In fact, a little known fact about the pandemic is that one of the most widespread coronavirus outbreaks after China in fact took place on a cruise ship. This ship was the Diamond Princess which has more than a thousand guest cabins and roughly the same number of crews.The ill fated vessel began its journey in late January and saw its passenger and crew count swell to almost four thousand people. All of these were left stranded at the Tokyo harbor in Japan for almost a month after initial reports surfaced that two elderly passengers that had gotten off the ship in Hong Kong had tested positive for the deadly virus. Matters took a serious turn when ten passengers on board the Diamond Princess tested positive and the ship remained in limbo stuck at Tokyo for 27 days, with 14 passengers dying and 712 becoming infected.However, the Diamond Princess was not the only ship stuck due to the virus. According to a Guardian investigation, more than one hundred thousand cruise ship crew members were left stranded at sea due to the virus, and many of them would die in the waters as well. In terms of economic costs, research from Russian maritime universities show that they are simply unbelievable. The researchers point out that between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of the first quarter of 2020, cruise companies saw their profits drop from $30 billion to just $50 million, for an almost complete decimation. The pandemic also put several companies out of business, as the total number of cruise companies dropped from 93 to 81 as the virus wreaked havoc all over the world.Story continuesThe pandemic also shook the perception of the cruise liner industry. A natural language processing (NLP) analysis of the tweets related to the industry conducted by researchers in Spain showed that the majority of sentiment surrounding the industry was negative. The analysis revealed that widespread media coverage of the pandemic combined with previously held beliefs about the cruise industry as being a 'petri dish' for diseases contributed significantly to negative sentiment, and it cautioned that this sentiment can continue even as the pandemic settles and life goes back to normal. Since this raises the question of whether people would be willing to take a cruise after the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, brief research reveals that researchers from the U.K. and Australia try to answer these very questions. By using a questionnaire through a research panel, they determined that risk perceptions related to cruise traveling were based on the participants' home country, with respondents from Australia having a more negative outlook when compared to those from the U.K. It also found out that the coronavirus pandemic was unique in the sense that it led to an experience agnostic perception about the future intention to take a cruise, which was in opposition to previous viruses that had seen people with previous cruise ship experiences having more positive intentions.With the worst behind it, a research report from Grand View Market Research estimates that the global cruise market was worth $7.25 billion in 2021 and that it grew to $7.67 billion in 2022. It adds that from 2022 onwards, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2022 to 2028 to sit at $15 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm adds that within the market, the river cruise segment will be the fastest growing and that it will outpace the broader industry by growing at 13.3%. According to Grand View Market Research, the ocean cruise segment was the largest segment in the market in 2021, as it accounted for 80% of the total revenues.After the coronavirus bloodbath, the industry is well on its way to recovery, with the chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), Mr. Jason Liberty, outlining during a recent earnings call in February 2023:We finished 2022 on a high note and are entering 2023 with the full strength of our operating and commercial platforms.

Times.A representative for Marvel Entertainment could not be reached by Fortune for comment.It's unclear whether the departure of Alonso, who publicly clashed with Iger’s successor-turned-predecessor Bob Chapek in April over his stance on the controversial ‘Don’t say Gay’ bill, was voluntary.But Disney expert Pasha believes it was an attempt by studio boss Feige to correct course after the recent spate of poor box office showings.“If she can be guillotined like this without any warning,” said Pasha, “this is bigger news than I think a lot of people realize.”Big-budget franchises under pressureWith the exception of blockbusters Spider-Man No Way Home—a Sony Pictures Entertainment film Marvel only co-produced—and Wakanda Forever, the MCU disappointed in Phase 4.A chief complaint has been weak stories relying too heavily on subpar CGI special effects and lackluster characters that fail to resonate with the broad audiences Disney needs.Story continuesHeightening the crisis for Disney, the first Phase 5 film, Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania, has underwhelmed at the box office. Now both Brie Larson’s The Marvels and a new Blade movie featuring Mahershala Ali have been delayed.It’s not just the MCU that is faring poorly of late, however.Big-budget franchises on a whole have been struggling, despite or perhaps because of every effort being made to keep milking their intellectual property regardless of artistic quality.DC’s rival superhero universe has been mostly a disappointment and is undergoing a hard reboot.Disney’s Star Wars property is a shadow of itself, with a planned film from Lost creator Damon Lindelof uncertain and excitement over the third season of The Mandalorian has been subdued.The Harry Potter prequel series Fantastic Beasts was euthanized after a steady loss in box office receipts and the future of fictional superspy James Bond is up in the air after actor Daniel Craig’s departure.Finally Amazon Prime's big-money Lord of the Rings prequel series failed to garner a single nomination at the Golden Globes.Arguably the most successful recent franchise entry was neither a theatrical film nor a TV series, but a video game.Hogwarts Legacy reaped $850 million in sales after just two weeks, according to Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav.But Disney desperately needs results after promising in February to cut costs by $5.5 billion and thin out its workforce through 7,000 forced redundancies.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

562,c8a58630-c0d8-37fa-9aba-f2b361435637,OKE,2023-03-23,JPMorgan Says Buy These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks — Including One With a 9% Yield,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-says-buy-2-high-094035339.html,1679391635,STORY,"['OKE', 'MPLX', 'MPLXP']","[Bank runs and extreme market volatility – are the shades of 1929 upon us? Probably not, the current situation, while dangerous, is unlikely to trigger an economy-wide depression.The real test, at least according to David Kelly, JPMorgan’s chief global strategist for asset management, will come on Wednesday, at the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate policy meeting. The central bank will have to determine which risk is more urgent, persistent high inflation or a bank crisis, and adjust its recent monetary tightening policy accordingly.Kelly has some definite opinions on what course the Fed should take. “We’ve learned what the limit is in terms of quick Fed tightening,” he said in a recent interview, “and the limit is here, and the Federal Reserve should just stop.”Whatever the Fed decides to do, the stock analysts at JPMorgan are taking a sharp turn toward high-yield dividend stocks, a standard defensive stock move when markets grow turbulent. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on two JPM dividend picks – finding from the data that these are Buy-rated equities with double-digit upside potential – and one has a dividend yield of 9%. Let’s take a closer look and find out why they believe these are compelling choices for investors right now.MPLX LP (MPLX)First up on our list of JPM dividend picks, is MPLX, the midstream spin-off of Marathon Petroleum. MPLX functions as a master limited partnership, owning and operating the original parent firm’s midstream energy transport network, as well as other logistic assets. MPLX also works in fuel distribution, moving refined fuel products from refineries to terminal nodes. MPLX’s network includes transport, terminal, and storage assets for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, as well as an extensive pipeline web and an inland marine section on the navigable rivers of North America. MPLX’s transport network leads to coastal export terminals, various refineries, and tank farms and storage facilities.Story continuesAll of this, and a market north of $33 billion, makes MPLX one of the largest midstream operators in North America, and its recent financial report, for Q4 and full year of 2022, shows the full scale. The company saw $2.5 billion at the top line, although the figure came in below the $3.3 billion achieved in Q3 and the $2.64 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Q4 EPS came in at 78 cents; this was flat y/y, and missed the forecast by 7%.As for the full year 2022 numbers, overall, MPLX saw y/y gains for last year. The annualized revenue came in at $11.15 billion, up almost 15% from 2021, and the 2022 net income, at $3.95 billion, was up 28% from the previous year. These results supported solid cash flows, with 2022’s net cash from operations hitting $5 billion, a total that allowed MPLX to return more than $3.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.On the dividends, there is plenty for investors to like. MPLX last paid out its common share dividend on February 14, at 77.5 cents per share. This annualizes to $3.10 per common share and gives a yield of 9.13%. The last numbers on inflation, for February, showed a 6% y/y rate, so MPLX’s dividend beats that by a wide margin, guaranteeing a real rate of return for investors. The company has kept up a reliable dividend payment for the last 10 years.JPM analyst Jeremy Tonet gives this stock a long look, and comes down on the side of the bulls. In his recent note on MPLX, Tonet write, “Similar to refined pipeline product peers, MPLX stands well positioned to capitalize on margin expansion as inflation escalators lift tariffs more than realized cost increases. Moreover, delivering on an ‘all of the above capital allocation’ philosophy, including steady distribution growth and buy-backs, eases our historical concerns on corporate governance…. at a healthy 3.5x YE22 leverage, MPLX tracks closer to the low end of the peer set, providing management with strong optionality between distribution increases and unit repurchases… From valuation perspective, while MPLX does not screen as the cheapest name in the group, we see the valuation as undemanding and favorable given the aforementioned defensive downstream characteristics.”Tonet complements his comments with an Overweight (Buy) rating, and gives a $41 price target that implies an upside of 21% for the year ahead. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here.)The JPM view is of the bullish variety here. This company’s 9 recent analyst reviews include 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $33.73, and the $39 average price target suggest that a gain of 16% lies ahead for the stock this year. (See MPLX’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Next on our list is Oneok, another midstream company in the hydrocarbon industry. Oneok focuses on the movement and transport of natural gas and natural gas liquids across the middle of the North American continent. The company’s network of gathering, processing, storage, and transport assets bring natural gas and gas products from production areas, especially in the Rocky Mountains and the Permian Basin, to the distribution and marketing centers.As with MPLX above, this is big business, and Oneok boasts a $27 billion market cap and multi-billion dollar annual revenues. In 2021, Oneok saw a top line of $17.27 billion; this increased to $22.87 billion in 2022.Drilling down to the most recent reported quarter, 4Q22, we find that Oneok’s quarterly revenues were lower y/y, at $5.97 billion compared to $5.7 billion in the prior year, while earnings rose. Q4’s bottom line, the net income, came in at $485 million, up 28% y/y. On a per-share basis, the company’s income came in at $1.08 per diluted share, up 27% from the 85 cents reported in the prior-year period – and beating the $1.02 forecast by more than 5%.Oneok’s results gave management confidence to increase the regular common share quarterly dividend by 2%, to a new payment of 95.5 cents. At the annualized payment of $3.82 per common share, the new dividend yields 6.4%. That yield, while only 0.4 points above inflation, is 3x the average dividend yield found among S&amp;P-listed firms – and Oneok had a long history of keeping reliable dividend payments.We’ll turn again to JPM’s Jeremy Tonet, who sees reason for optimism on this stock, based on Oneok’s prospects for improved business through 2023. Tonet writes, “On storage, OKE continues to progress on expanding Oklahoma storage capabilities by 4bcfd and continues evaluating idled storage facility reactivation in Oklahoma and Texas. Additionally ethane extraction dynamics proved topical on the call, as management noted expectations for the Permian to stay in high ethane recovery while growing international demand incentivizes incremental ethane out of the Midcon and Bakken at wider spreads later in the year…. Notably, the 2023 well connect schedule includes some wells connects pushed from 2022.”Taking this prospect into account, Tonet rates this stock as Overweight (Buy), with a $78 price target to indicate potential for 28% share appreciation in the next 12 months. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here.)With 11 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys and 7 Holds, Oneok’s shares have a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. The average price target of $74.91 implies a one-year gain of 23% from the current share price of $60.76.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is the latest disaster investors are confronted with and has sent ripples through the entire stock market. On Friday, March 10, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 1.4%, closing one of the worst weeks of 2023 for the market. These fluctuating market conditions have turned investors’ attention toward income-generating stocks that usually help them stay afloat in this environment.Dividend stocks have the ability to generate stable and regular income for investors on a quarterly or monthly basis. However, the high levels of inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies have put a strain on corporate balance sheets with the possibility of dividend cuts. For this reason, analysts are recommending focusing on companies with strong cash flows when investing in dividend stocks. R. Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The best dividend companies are the ones that have thought it through and have a philosophy behind what they are doing with their dividend. This should be rooted in current cash flow and their expectations for business growth over time.”Companies with strong cash flow tend to raise their dividends for the long term. These companies continue raising their payouts despite the pressure on corporate balance sheets due to inflation and other economic conditions. To diversify their portfolios across a broad range of sectors, investors also turn to dividend-focused exchange-traded funds. These funds reported strong performance last year considering the market downturn. Dividend funds declined by 6.68% on average in 2022, compared with a 19.4% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesYields are also significant when investing in dividend stocks as healthy yields can provide investors profits on their investments. Moreover, high-dividend stocks have historically performed better than their peers. Previously we reported that high-yield dividend stocks exhibited less volatility over the last 15 years.Some of the popular dividend stocks that have grabbed investors’ attention include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have raised their payouts for a significant period.

(NASDAQ:AKAM) Trading At A 24% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-technologies-inc-nasdaq-akam-111148264.html,1679569908,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Key InsightsAkamai Technologies' estimated fair value is US$98.18 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAkamai Technologies is estimated to be 24% undervalued based on current share price of US$74.15Our fair value estimate is 3.5% higher than Akamai Technologies' analyst price target of US$94.83How far off is Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$520.0mUS$737.7mUS$898.4mUS$994.0mUS$1.13bUS$1.23bUS$1.31bUS$1.38bUS$1.44bUS$1.50bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x12Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 8.84%Est @ 6.81%Est @ 5.39%Est @ 4.39%Est @ 3.70% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$476US$618US$689US$697US$725US$722US$706US$681US$651US$618(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$21bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$21b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$8.8bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$15b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$74.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Akamai Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.211. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Akamai TechnologiesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The full results can be read here.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)Audience hijacking is now a widespread phenomenon that is estimated to disrupt up to 15 percent of e-commerce site visits. To enhance their in-browser experiences, many shoppers now install browser extensions, plug-ins, or other browser widgets to help find coupons or offer price comparisons. Sometimes these browser extensions are unknowingly installed on the consumer's device for malicious purposes and can divert visitors away from their intended journey, allowing competitors and malicious actors to disrupt  e-commerce experiences carefully crafted by retail brands.Akamai teamed with Retail Dive for the survey to gauge how familiar retailers are with audience hijacking and the impact it presents. The three main findings of the survey include:Retailers understand that audience hijacking is a significant problem: A significant majority of survey participants (85 percent) said they were at least somewhat familiar with the concept of audience hijacking. As many as 72 percent said that they were very or extremely familiar with it. This finding highlights the fact that, at least among stakeholders within midsize to large retail organizations, there is broad awareness of the problem. When asked whether audience hijacking presented a major challenge to their organization, a large majority (82 percent) of survey participants generally agreed that it was. Retailers lack visibility into exactly what's going on during site visits: This is particularly in terms of extensions, pop-ups and scripts running within the customer's browser. Although today's retailers invest heavily in every aspect of digital experience management, they're still unable to explain why a large number of cart abandonments occur. As many as 82 percent of respondents say they lack visibility into the causes of cart abandonment for five percent of online transactions or more, or they simply don't know how often shopping carts are abandoned for reasons they can't determine. Of this group, 30 percent cannot explain cart abandonment for up to 24 percent of user sessions – a significant number of lost customer conversions. Due to a lack of visibility, retailers tend to underestimate the likelihood that audience hijacking is causing churn: We saw this disconnect when 15 percent of survey participants said that audience hijacking wasn't a major challenge for their organization, yet 90 percent were seeing user sessions disrupted by such activities. Some admitted that they entirely lacked visibility into audience hijacking's prevalence. But audience hijacking clearly continues to have a major impact on retailers with 28 percent of respondents reporting that its biggest impact is revenue loss. A further 23 percent say that it is compromising ROI on digital marketing investments. Nearly one-quarter of respondents (23 percent) indicate that audience hijacking has diminished their customers' loyalty, and 17 percent say it's causing fewer shoppers to make repeat purchases from their e-commerce stores.Story continues""Audience hijacking is a growing problem, and the full extent of it is often difficult to understand and measure,"" said Patrick Sullivan, CTO of Security Strategy at Akamai. ""This survey helps give us insight into the challenges retailers themselves say they face in regard to this issue, which will only become more widespread this year and beyond.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

F5 Distributed Cloud Services are differentiated in providing connectivity and security at both the network and application layers. As an overlay across separate cloud provider offerings (including native cloud services), Distributed Cloud Services let F5 customers easily integrate network operations, application performance optimization and troubleshooting, and visibility through a single management console.According to F5’s just released 2023 State of Application Strategy (SOAS) Report, 85% of organizations operate distributed application deployments, spanning traditional and modern architectures and multiple hosting environments. However, these distributed deployments add operational complexity and cost, obscure visibility, and increase the surface area for potential cyberattacks. F5 delivers a platform-based approach that is cloud-agnostic and purpose-built to meet the needs of traditional and modern apps—all without increasing complexity or losing granular control and necessary visibility. Specifically, today’s introduction of Distributed Cloud App Connect and Distributed Cloud Network Connect unlocks enhanced MCN use cases.New Distributed Cloud Services Simplify App and Network ConnectivityTraditional network design and infrastructure models are unable to accommodate the demands of modern apps and the digital experiences they provide, largely because newer microservices-based apps rely on distributed Kubernetes cluster services and APIs, and are not constrained to a single cloud location or even a single cloud provider. Per the 2023 SOAS Report, the top-rated multi-cloud challenges are managing the complexity of associated tools and APIs, applying consistent security across apps, and optimizing app performance. To properly address these challenges, a more comprehensive approach to secure MCN is required—one that provides:Story continuesAn integrated service stack that addresses both layer 3 transit and layer 7 app-to-app service networking between clouds and distributed applications to minimize complexity and increase agility.End-to-end security for both networking between clouds/locations and for the protection of the workloads being connected, with unified policy controls for faster response to evolving threats.Cloud-agnostic orchestration for application discovery, networking, and security, as well as for end-to-end private connectivity.Granular control of app-to-app communications for modern apps with embedded app security.""Secure app-to-app connectivity is obviously a goal for every digital organization, but how this is achieved has become increasingly important,"" said Michael Rau, SVP and General Manager, F5 Distributed Cloud Platform and Security Services. ""The proliferation of cloud and hybrid architectures has coincided with the rise of microservices and API-heavy distributed applications—all of which contribute complexity and diminish visibility. Distributed Cloud Services greatly expand our ability to serve customers’ hybrid and multi-cloud use cases, providing unparalleled agility and security for global infrastructure and app environments.""F5 is uniquely positioned to deliver necessary enabling technologies for MCN by connecting and securing any app and any API anywhere, ensuring fast network-to-network and workload-to-workload connectivity across different cloud locations, data centers, hybrid environments, and enterprise edge sites. In the year since the introduction of Distributed Cloud Services, F5 has continued to expand the capabilities delivered as SaaS and managed services, including the recent addition of Distributed Cloud App Infrastructure Protection. Today’s announcement furthers the reach of Distributed Cloud Services through the following new SaaS offerings:Distributed Cloud App Connect provides an integrated stack approach through a single console to combine comprehensive app networking with full app security, faster provisioning, and ease of use.Advanced app networking services including load balancing, API gateway, ingress/egress control, and end-to-end visibility.Automated or one-click provisioning of additional web application and API protection (WAAP) services such as web application firewall, DDoS, bot mitigation, and API security.Native Kubernetes integration with fine-grained control on app-to-app and even specific API-to-API communications without exposing the underlying network, greatly reducing security risks and increasing speed of app delivery.Distributed Cloud Network Connect makes it highly secure and simple to deploy connectivity across cloud locations and cloud providers.Automated provisioning and orchestration of cloud provider connectivity services to reduce management complexity and increase visibility.Secure connectivity and extensibility with intent-based micro-segmentation and service insertion of third-party network functions virtualization (NFV).Optional fully private F5 Global Network to optimize app performance and provide high-speed private connectivity to public cloud providers.""Enterprises’ cloud strategies are evolving from multiple apps spread across multiple clouds to true multi-cloud architectures with distributed workloads. That will require cloud and network architects to design their multi-cloud networks to provide both network- and application-layer connectivity,"" said Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst, ZK Research. ""F5 has long been a leader in application networking, and their Distributed Cloud Services provide a fully integrated set of layer 3–7 services for securely connecting across clouds and workloads, even those deployed at the edge or branch office.""""Our clients have begun embracing the concept of distributing workloads and entire applications across different cloud providers, as well as hybrid architectures that include data centers or edge locations,"" said Colin Williams, Business CTO, Networking &amp; Security, Computacenter UK. ""With that strategy comes the challenge of reducing infrastructure complexity across multiple and varied environments, especially when connecting both networks and applications while maintaining consistent security and visibility. F5 Distributed Cloud Services provide easy-to-use SaaS-based multi-cloud networking to help our clients quickly and securely connect their distributed cloud instances and workloads.""Industry Insights for Hybrid and Multi-Cloud in F5’s State of Application Strategy ReportBased on the surveyed responses of more than 1,000 IT decision makers from around the globe, F5 is also introducing its 2023 State of Application Strategy (SOAS) Report. Hailing from a broad mix of industries, IT leaders share their priorities and concerns with F5 in this ninth annual report focused on digital transformation.

(NASDAQ:FFIV)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-f5-inc-nasdaq-110038515.html,1679310038,STORY,['FFIV'],"[F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$157 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$137. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether F5's current trading price of US$141 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at F5’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for F5 Is F5 Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that F5’s ratio of 28.11x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 23.86x, which means if you buy F5 today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe F5 should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since F5’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of F5 look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for F5. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FFIV’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at FFIV? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on FFIV, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for FFIV, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends consecutively for 25 years or more. These stocks are popular among investors because they can generate stable and regular income for them, which tends to grow over time. In addition to this, these securities provide protection during market downturns. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022. The report also mentioned that during the 15 worst-performing months for the S&amp;P 1500 during the same period, the high-yield index fell by 7.29%, compared with a 9.58% decline in the S&amp;P Composite 1500.When investing in dividend growers, investors look beyond yield and focus on other factors, including value, cash flow, and other business fundamentals. Companies that have proven records of dividend growth remain committed to their shareholder obligation and signal that they have the ability to raise their dividends in the long term. Washington Crossing Advisors referred to data by Ned Davis Research and revealed that dividend growers delivered a higher return with lower volatility when compared with ordinary dividend payers, non-dividend companies, and dividend cutters. The report mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014 with a 15.9% annual risk. In comparison, dividend cutters returned 3.4% during this period with an annual risk of 25.1%.Dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance during inflationary periods. The same report highlighted that companies with solid dividend growth returned 6.5% from 1972 to 2014 when inflation was above 4%, compared with a negative 7.9% return of the dividend cutters.Story continuesThe arguments discussed above show that investing in quality companies with strong cash flow can protect investors from market downturns. Mike Morey, the chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, spoke to Business Insider about his winning strategy to invest in companies with solid cash generation. Here are some comments from the fund manager:""We don't have to worry about what the Fed is doing; we don't have to worry about the economic cycle. Just simply by focusing on quality companies with strong free cash flows is going to get you through any economic cycle. And looking at performance over a full cycle, we're confident we can deliver superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis.""He also recommended buying stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) because of their growth and strong balance sheets.Considering these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend aristocrat stocks in this article.14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 14 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational medical device company, headquartered in Ireland, Dublin. In its recent quarterly earnings, the company reported a strong cash position. At the end of January 2023, it had over $4.5 billion available in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $3.7 billion in the prior-year period. In nine months that ended January, the company's operating cash flow came in at $3.8 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $2.5 billion.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share on March 2. In 2022, the company took its dividend growth streak to 45 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.42%, as of March 20. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 with a Hold rating on the shares, following the company's recent quarterly earnings. The firm also expects the company to report strong fiscal 2024 guidance.At the end of Q4 2022, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) was a part of 58 hedge fund portfolios, up from 55 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's data. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced disappointing clinical trial results for a new product in its pipeline and lowered its fiscal 2023 financial guidance due to lingering supply chain issues and slower than expected medical procedure recovery.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock in March and mentioned that the company's tax litigation risk is 'well discounted'. The firm also noted that the company could see resilient consumption this year.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as recorded on March 20.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s cash position remained strong in FY22. The company's operating cash flow came in at $11 billion, whereas its free cash flow for the year stood at $9.5 billion. It remained committed to its shareholder return as it distributed over $7.6 billion to investors in dividends during the year.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q4 2022. Overall, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, worth $28.8 billion collectively.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American medical device and healthcare company that provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. Recently, the company announced the FDA approval for its blood-based laboratory test for traumatic brain injury. This lab test will give results in 18 minutes and is the first commercially available laboratory test in the US.On February 17, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its payouts for 51 years, which places it as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 20 came in at 2.09%In January, Barclays raised its price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's medical device segment.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 2022 database, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), compared with 62 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based renewable energy company that mainly specializes in energy infrastructure. On February 17, the company declared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.4675 per share. This marked the company's 27th consecutive year of dividend growth.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. We saw mixed results from this group in the fourth quarter, with paint and coatings maker The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) benefiting from significant pricing power that will allow it to grow earnings handsomely with only modest revenue increases.""8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American retail corporation that owns grocery stores and department stores. The company's subscription service, Walmart+, now has over 18.4 million paid members, according to an estimate by Morgan Stanley.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Fundsmith LLP was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure.

The collaboration is likely to be a win-win deal for both the marquee brands, offering improved customer service and safety enhancement.With 63 million members, AAA is one of North America's most prominent companies providing roadside assistance services. Every year, it receives about 30 million calls on average. As the traffic gets busier and more congested, these numbers will likely increase. Fleet managers must continuously operate optimally to match these rising requirements. With T-Mobile's fast and reliable wireless network solution, AAA intends to meet these needs by offering best-in-class roadside assistance and boosting safety for its members, tow providers, and drivers.AAA is aiming to enhance productivity by integrating TMUS’s loT and Geotab fleet telematics solutions into its roadside assistance fleet.

JBL recently announced that it has collaborated with KAV Sports to develop customized bicycle helmets that meet all safety standards while delivering improved performance and aesthetics. These 3D-printed helmets are developed from custom nylon carbon-fiber material engineered by Jabil, leveraging its additive manufacturing prowess and pervasive manufacturing capabilities.The traditional bike helmets usually come in one to three sizes and are often ill-fit for all head shapes and sizes. These new helmets are made from injection-molded, expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam with certain limitations in stability, durability and comfort in varied temperatures ranging from -15 degrees to more than 60 degrees Celsius.This is where Jabil’s additive manufacturing expertise came in handy when it came up with a perfect material that provided excellent energy absorption, increased layer-to-layer adhesion for consistent performance and offered an improved look and feel. This proprietary nylon carbon-fiber composite embodied all the necessary properties and passed all the quality standard tests and validation testing to achieve certification in accordance with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and ISO 9001 Quality Management System certification.The helmets are now available for mass customization with 3D printing in grey, black and white colors. The additive manufacturing process allows KAV Sports to reduce production costs and eliminate unnecessary waste, becoming an instant hit with users. It now aims to reach a wider customer base by capitalizing on Jabil’s extensive manufacturing capacities and supply chain efficiencies.Jabil’s focus on end-market and product diversification is a key catalyst. The company’s target that “no product or product family should be greater than 5% operating income or cash flows in any fiscal year” is commendable. This initiative should position the company well on the growth trajectory. The diversification will increase the reliability of the company’s earnings and revenues, thereby driving returns for investors in the long haul.In addition, Jabil’s top-line growth is expected to benefit from strength in healthcare, cloud, retail and industrial.

Moreover, its unmatched depth of end-market experience, technical and design capabilities, manufacturing know-how, supply chain insights and global product management expertise have put it in good stead.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Comcast How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.0% = US$4.9b ÷ US$82b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Media industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Comcast visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Comcast's Debt And Its 6.0% Return On EquityComcast does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.20. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Comcast began construction of the infrastructure this month and expects to make a full suite of Internet and video services available to approximately 1,700 homes and businesses in 2023 with the potential to add more locations next year in these rural communities.Some homes and businesses will start receiving access to Comcast service starting in June with construction expected to continue through February 2024. Once construction is complete, all of these homes and businesses will have the foundational next-generation network in place to introduce new multi-gigabit Internet options.Comcast is introducing fiber-rich network improvements that will offer Oregon customers upload speeds up to 10 times faster than the fastest they have now. And the network upgrade will extend throughout Comcast’s service area in Oregon to every community, zip code, and neighborhood served by the network.“We know that high-speed Internet access in rural areas is linked to increased job and population growth, higher rates of new business formation and home values, and lower unemployment rates,” said Rodrigo Lopez, Senior Regional Vice President of Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. ““That is why Comcast is committed to expanding its existing network to additional underserved residents, businesses and communities in Oregon that currently do not have access to reliable, high-speed Internet.”The network expansion is the latest example of Comcast’s investment to connect more households and businesses in the Pacific Northwest to its Internet services that deliver fast speeds, more reliability, broader coverage in the home, and greater capacity to support customers’ growing Internet usage. Comcast expanded service to more than 19,000 additional homes and businesses last year in Oregon. Further, the company has invested more than $504 million in technology and infrastructure investments in Oregon during the previous three years, including network expansion and upgrades.Story continuesEagle Creek and Estacada residents also will have access to Internet Essentials, the largest and most comprehensive low-cost Internet adoption program for low-income Americans. Comcast proudly participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program, and offers Internet Essentials Plus, a $29.95/month home Internet service that is effectively free for eligible households, once the ACP credit is applied.

(NYSE:PRU) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudential Financial. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Prudential Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudential Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 4.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$51m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

592,4773dafc-85d2-34a7-bc32-3edfb24cdabc,DVN,2023-03-23,The 5.9% return this week takes Devon Energy's (NYSE:DVN) shareholders three-year gains to 719%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-9-return-week-takes-130017022.html,1679576417,STORY,['DVN'],"[While Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 21% in the last quarter. But that doesn't displace its brilliant performance over three years. The longer term view reveals that the share price is up 567% in that period. As long term investors the recent fall doesn't detract all that much from the longer term story. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.Since the stock has added US$1.7b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Devon Energy moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Devon Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was 719%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Devon Energy shareholders are down 16% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 12%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Devon Energy is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

On that day, Devon Energy is projected to report earnings of $1.55 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 17.55%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.22 billion, up 10.75% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.96 per share and revenue of $17.47 billion, which would represent changes of -16.25% and -8.86%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Devon Energy. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, United Rentals has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while James Hardie has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that URI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.55, while JHX has a forward P/E of 15.20. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.58. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. JHX currently has a PEG ratio of 5.41.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 3.91. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, JHX has a P/B of 5.86.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, URI holds a Value grade of A, while JHX has a Value grade of D.URI sticks out from JHX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that URI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: URI), the world’s largest equipment rental company, today announced that its 2023 Spring Used Equipment Sale Event will take place at 176 United Rentals locations in the United States and Canada on Thursday, March 23.During the event, companies and government organizations can review a robust fleet of well-maintained used equipment originally sourced from top-tier manufacturers. United Rentals offers more than 4,000 classes of equipment for sale, including aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment, forklifts and other material handling machines, light towers, generators, lawn and landscape equipment and more.For information on participating locations, visit the United Rentals Used Equipment webpage.""Our Spring Used Equipment Sale is a great opportunity for companies to add reliable, productive machines to their fleet without the sticker shock of a new equipment purchase,"" said Mike Durand, Senior Vice President, Sales and Operations at United Rentals. ""All of our equipment is well-maintained, so customers can be confident that the machines they buy are ready to go to work on the jobsite. Quality used equipment is a great option for companies that want to preserve capital while bringing on more fleet in time for spring construction and maintenance projects.""Advantages of Purchasing Used EquipmentWith spring just around the corner, companies are looking for ways to ready their equipment fleet for the upcoming busy season. Buying quality used machinery can be a cost-effective way to expand fleet in anticipation of the increased workload.Here are four ways companies can benefit by buying used equipment, whether a boom lift, scissor lift, excavator or other type of machine. This can be a smart investment if a company’s utilization of the machine will be high and the equipment meets these criteria.Story continuesStrong Value: Used equipment carries a lower price tag than the same machine purchased new, allowing resources to be allocated to other business priorities or productivity-enhancing equipment accessories and technology. In addition, used heavy equipment typically holds its value, in large part because much of the asset depreciation has already occurred. By some estimates, new heavy equipment depreciates in value by 20 to 40 percent within the first year. With a used equipment strategy, companies can avoid this initial ""hit"" and reap the savings from a much lower depreciation rate.Wide Selection: Recent supply chain challenges can limit availability of new machines purchased from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or extend delivery times. Buying quality used equipment originally sourced from top-tier OEMs provides access to a wider variety of makes and models with accelerated lead and delivery times.High-Performing Equipment: Large rental companies that sell used fleet typically have the resources in place to ensure proper ongoing maintenance to OEM standards throughout ownership of the equipment. This consistent preventative maintenance means that when the equipment is offered for sale, it is ready to perform. As the leading equipment rental provider in the market, United Rentals offers the most extensive selection of used equipment maintained by the industry’s largest team of professional technicians.Ongoing Maintenance and Training: The ancillary benefits of purchasing used equipment from a large rental company go beyond the machines themselves. Buyers can realize ongoing safety and productivity benefits by tapping into value-added programs offered by sellers, such as warranty options, extended maintenance plans and training programs.United Rentals Used EquipmentUnited Rentals offers more than 4,000 classes of equipment of used equipment, originally sourced from top-tier OEM manufacturers and consistently maintained to OEM standards. Convenient financing with United Rentals is available, with up to 100 percent financing for terms of one to five years.

EME is benefiting from accretive acquisitions and a robust construction business. The U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segments are witnessing strong project growth over the years due to the company’s disciplined project execution strategies and acquisition policies.The above-mentioned tailwinds helped EMCOR report the impressive fourth-quarter 2022 results. In the quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.4% and 2.8%, respectively, and increased year over year. The quarterly results reflect strong demand across geographies, solid remaining performance obligations and bolt-on acquisitions.Shares of EME have gained 35% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry’s growth of 15.7%. Earnings estimates for 2023 have shown improvement in the past 30 days, portraying the possible prospects for the company. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, this mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, and building services provider is affected by supply-chain disruptions, intense economic inflation and the cyclical nature of the market.TailwindsEMCOR’s strategic acquisition plan aimed to buy small private firms with proven management and expansion potential bode well. In 2022, EMCOR acquired six companies, spending $100.8 million. The acquired companies in the Greater Boston area and the Midwestern region of the United States were included in the U.S. Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment.The other acquired companies in the Northeastern and Southern regions of the United States were included in the U.S. Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segment. Adding to these, the U.S. Building Services segment included two companies, one in the Southwestern region and the other in the Southern region of the United States. These acquisitions portrayed long-term growth prospects, even during the volatile economic condition.The U.S. Construction segment has been maintaining strong momentum. The company’s major segments, primarily the U.S. Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments, continue to display significant strength. Within the U.S. Construction umbrella, the U.S. Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment revenues increased 19.9% year over year in 2022, with organic revenue growth of 13.2%, backed by increased revenues from the commercial and healthcare market sectors and certain transmission and distribution projects.Also, during the period, the U.S. Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segment revenues rose 9.5% from the year-ago level due to significant increases in commercial and healthcare market sectors.Story continuesHeadwindsEMCOR continues to witness supply-related challenges and high inflationary pressures. Supply-chain delays due to the Russia-Ukraine war have resulted in increased input costs and project delays. The company witnessed project delays in U.S. Construction segments due to the revision of estimated costs to complete a performance obligation and estimated transaction prices.The inflationary pressures have resulted in interest rate hikes, which increased the company’s interest expenses. In 2022, the gross and operating margins declined 70 basis points (bps) and 30 bps on a year-over-year basis, respectively. The company expects these headwinds to continue in 2023, affecting its growth prospects.EMCOR’s business, which is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the markets in which its clients operate, is dependent upon the timing and funding of new awards. Investment decisions of the customers may vary in terms of location or as a result of factors like the availability of labor, relative construction costs or competitive conditions in their industries. Also, reduced or delayed spending by the federal government and state and local governments may have a material and significant impact on business.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksEME currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP, Signet Jewelers Ltd. SIG, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. WSM, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Amid Market UncertaintyWall Street has been trying to recover after taking a beating earlier this month as concerns over interest rate hikes continue to dent investors' confidence. Inflationary pressures have been taking a toll on markets despite a solid start to the year.Fears that the Fed would maintain its strict monetary policy and interest rate hike strategy for a longer period than initially anticipated have been reignited by strong economic statistics and hotter-than-expected inflation.Tensions escalated further in March after the U.S. financial sector was hit hard following the collapse of two banks.Earlier this month, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which mostly lends to tech firms, announced that it had to sell $1.75 billion in shares at a loss in order to cover falling customer demand. Since then, things have become worse with the bank's collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) taking over the operations of the bank.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the cryptocurrency sector, stated that it would be ceasing operations and liquidating its bank. As a result, the American government assumed authority over Signature Bank's deposits.SVB's collapse has since left bank stocks battered. Although a joint statement from the Fed, Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp assured that all depositors at these two banks would get their money back and that the U.S. financial system is stable, worries have been growing.Story continuesInvestors are now bracing for another rate hike by the Fed, which will be announced on Mar 22. Market participants are expecting a 25-basis point rate hike, which will further create pressure on stocks as more interest rate hikes are likely to be implemented in the coming months. The Fed's fight to tame rising inflation is far from over.Given this situation, an astute investor would choose to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks at this time. Dividend stocks with a good business model and a proven track record can withstand market volatility.Also, in addition to ensuring a constant flow of profits, dividend stocks reduce the chances of price swings. Also, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed non-dividend-paying companies.Four such companies are Roper Technologies, Inc., Signet Jewelers Ltd., Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Applied Materials, Inc. and Oracle Corp.. Each of these companies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

609,11e98fbe-8ee8-3021-b1d2-df6d8f48877d,ORCL,2023-03-23,5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Amid Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-130001317.html,1679490001,STORY,"['SIG', 'ROP', 'ORCL', 'WSM', 'AMAT']","[Wall Street has been trying to recover after taking a beating earlier this month as concerns over interest rate hikes continue to dent investors' confidence. Inflationary pressures have been taking a toll on markets despite a solid start to the year.Fears that the Fed would maintain its strict monetary policy and interest rate hike strategy for a longer period than initially anticipated have been reignited by strong economic statistics and hotter-than-expected inflation.Tensions escalated further in March after the U.S. financial sector was hit hard following the collapse of two banks.Earlier this month, Silicon Valley Bank, which mostly lends to tech firms, announced that it had to sell $1.75 billion in shares at a loss in order to cover falling customer demand. Since then, things have become worse with the bank’s collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) taking over the operations of the bank.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital Corp. (SI), a major lender to the cryptocurrency sector, stated that it would be ceasing operations and liquidating its bank. As a result, the American government assumed authority over Signature Bank’s (SBNY) deposits.SVB’s collapse has since left bank stocks battered. Although a joint statement from the Fed, Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp assured that all depositors at these two banks would get their money back and that the U.S. financial system is stable, worries have been growing.Investors are now bracing for another rate hike by the Fed, which will be announced on Mar 22. Market participants are expecting a 25-basis point rate hike, which will further create pressure on stocks as more interest rate hikes are likely to be implemented in the coming months. The Fed’s fight to tame rising inflation is far from over.Given this situation, an astute investor would choose to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks at this time. Dividend stocks with a good business model and a proven track record can withstand market volatility.Story continuesAlso, in addition to ensuring a constant flow of profits, dividend stocks reduce the chances of price swings.

Congress is pushing legislation to ban the popular Chinese-owned social media app from most government devices. When TikTok chief Shou Zi Chew testifies at the US Congress tomorrow (Mar. 23), he will try to dismantle any and all notions about the app sharing US user data with the Chinese government.At a time when lawmakers are rallying to ban the video-sharing app nationwide—several K-12 schools, universities, and federal agencies have already done so—Chew will take the congressional stand to make a case for why a ban is unnecessary.Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?“TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, US user data with the Chinese government. Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made,” Chew will say, according to written testimony posted yesterday (Mar. 21) by the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.Chew will emphasize that TikTok is “a US company incorporated in the United States…subject to the laws of the United States.” Chew will note TikTok’s headquarters are in Los Angeles and Singapore, and most of the executive team is based there. The app is not available in mainland China. (China’s version of TikTok is called Duoyin, which is only available in China.)One big number: TikTok’s US users150 million: People in the US that use TikTok on a monthly basis, with the average user today being an adult well past college age, according to Chew. US users represent 10% of TikTok’s global community, but their content accounts for 25% of the total views around the world.A brief summary of the agenda for Chew’s hearingOn Jan. 30, House Energy and Commerce Committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers announced that Chew would be grilled on…🛡️ TikTok’s consumer privacy and data security practices🧒 The platforms’ impact on kids🇨🇳 TikTok’s relationship with the Chinese Communist PartyIn his testimony, Chew is expected to address all these concerns, saying that the platform will “keep safety—particularly for teenagers—a top priority” and “firewall protected US user data from unauthorized foreign access,” and resist manipulation by any government. Lastly, for accountability, Chew promises the platform will “be transparent and give access to third-party independent monitors.”Story continuesIf not TikTok, is ByteDance a national security threat for the US?Calls to ban the app have often pointed to TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs and is one of the biggest internet companies in the country.Chew will argue, though, that ByteDance is “a privately-held global company.” Bytedance is 60% owned by global institutional investors (such as Blackrock, General Atlantic, and Sequoia), approximately 20% owned by the company’s founders, and approximately 20% owned by its employees, “including thousands of Americans.”“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” he will say.US user data TikTok collects, as per Chew’s testimonyKey: always (✅), sometimes (💁‍♀️), and never (⛔)✅ Date of birth✅ Username💁‍♀️ Phone number💁‍♀️ Email address⛔ Real names during registration⛔ Employment⛔ Relationship status⛔ Precise or approximate GPS informationA non-exhaustive timeline of the US’s tussle with TikTokJuly 2020: The Trump administration moves to ban TikTokAug. 2020: Trump signs an executive order barring transactions between US citizens and TikTok within 45 days, and another instructing TikTok to sell all US assets within 90 days.Oct. and Dec. 2020: Federal judges in Pennsylvania and Washington block the ban.June 2022: A BuzzFeed report reveals US TikTok user data was repeatedly accessed by ByteDance employees in China. Simultaneously, TikTok starts migrating all US user traffic to Oracle’s cloud servers.July 2022: Leaders of the US Senate Intelligence Committee ask the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether TikTok deceived the public about Chinese employees’ access to American user data. Later, Bloomberg reports the Chinese government requested TikTok host stealth propaganda accounts.Aug. 2022: A Forbes analysis of TikTok and ByteDance employees’ LinkedIn profiles shows 300 current ones previously worked for Chinese state media publications.Oct. 2022: A Forbes report says that ByteDance intended to surveil American citizens’ locations via TikTok.The company denies these claims.Dec. 2022: Congress votes to bar federal employees from using TikTok on government-owned devices.Feb. 2023: The White House gives government agencies 30 days to purge TikTok from all federal devices.March 2023: New legislation that empowers the secretary of Commerce to take restrictive action against tech firms based in six foreign adversary nations—Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, and China—is endorsed by the White House.Company of interest: OracleIn July 2022, TikTok rolled out its “Project Texas” initiative, which had been in development and under wraps for two years prior. It addresses data security, works to protect influence over content, and vets that there are no backdoors into the app. The company has spent $1.5 billion on the program that has over 1,500 people working on it.The biggest move made as part of this corporate restructuring plan is that TikTok partnered with Oracle to route all US user data through Oracle’s cloud infrastructure—and 100% of it is. TikTok this month started to delete historical US user protected data in data centers in Virginia and Singapore—a process expected to be completed later this year.Moreover, Oracle “has already begun inspecting TikTok’s source code and will have unprecedented access to the related algorithms and data models,” Chew will inform the lawmakers.Relates stories🇺🇸 TikTok faces a ban in the US if it retains Chinese-based ownership👀 TikTok’s updated data privacy policy does little to settle nerves🏛️ US lawmakers have renewed their efforts to ban TikTokMore from QuartzThe US will pilot a program to renew H-1B visas domesticallyMore than half of US nursing homes are unprofitable—and it's about to get a lot worseSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Spurred by a boom in consumer and enterprise applications, such as advanced chatbots and eye-popping graphics generators, “generative AI will reinvent nearly every industry,” Huang said.The idea is to build infrastructure that can make AI apps faster and more accessible to customers. Nvidia’s graphics processing units have become the brains behind ChatGPT and its ilk, helping them digest and process ever-greater sums of training data. Microsoft Corp. revealed last week it had to string together tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 GPUs in data centers in order to handle the computational workload in the cloud for OpenAI, ChatGPT’s developer.Other tech giants are following suit with similarly colossal cloud infrastructures geared for AI. Oracle Corp. announced that its platform will feature 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, the A100’s successor, for high-performance compute applications, and Nvidia said a forthcoming system from Amazon Web Services will be able to scale up to 20,000 interconnected H100s. Microsoft has likewise started adding the H100 to its server racks.These kinds of chip superclusters are part of a push by Nvidia to rent out supercomputing services through a new program called DGX Cloud, hosted by Oracle and soon Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Nvidia said the goal is to make accessing an AI supercomputer as easy as opening a webpage, enabling companies to train their models without the need for on-premise infrastructure that’s costly to install and manage.Story continues“Provide your job, point to your data set, and you hit go — and all of the orchestration and everything underneath is taken care of,” said Manuvir Das, Nvidia’s vice president of enterprise computing. The DGX Cloud service will start at $36,999 per instance per month, with each “instance”— essentially the amount of computing horsepower being rented — equating to eight H100 GPUs.Nvidia also launched two new chips, one focused on enhancing AI video performance and the other an upgrade to the H100.The latter GPU is designed specifically to improve the deployment of large language models like those used by ChatGPT. Called the H100 NVL, it can perform 12 times faster when handling inferences — that is, how AI responds to real-life queries — compared with the prior generation of A100s at scale in data centers.Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing at Nvidia, said it will help “democratize ChatGPT use cases and bring that capability to every server and every cloud.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Happens When Sexting Chatbots Dump Their Human LoversHow to Keep Corporate Accounts Safe Amid Bank Collapse JittersIranian Activists Want Tech Companies to Ban the AyatollahChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight Trains©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Take a look at three whose performance has been outstanding.Angel Oak Mortgage REIT Inc. (NYSE: AOMR) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that provides programs specifically for consumers whose circumstances may not meet standard agency financing guidelines. Angel Oak is the largest non-bank originator of nonqualified mortgages.Angel Oak Mortgage began the year by announcing its participation in AOMT 2023-1, a $580.5 million scheduled principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans. Through the process, Angel Oak Mortgage was able to reduce its whole loan warehouse debt by 51% and mark-to-market percentage of total warehouse debt by 62% from the end of the third quarter of 2022.Angel Oak Mortgage shares rose strongly throughout the first two months, but on March 9, it released somewhat negative fourth-quarter operating results. Distributable earnings loss of $2.50 per share missed the consensus estimate of $0.31 by 906.45% and was 380.9% below earnings of $0.89 per share from the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue of $7.41 million was 45.03% below consensus estimates of $13.73 million and a 55.34% decrease from sales of $16.59 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.After a small decline following the announcement, the stock has traded sideways. Year to date, Angel Oak Mortgage is up 52.64%.Service Properties Trust (NASDAQ: SVC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based diversified REIT with a portfolio of 1,003 properties, including 238 hotels and 765 service-focused net-lease retail outlets in 46 states, Puerto Rico and Canada.Story continuesService Properties Trust gained about 52% between January and February. The gain was largely due to BP’s acquisition of TravelCenters of America for $86 per share in cash, or about $1.3 billion. Service Properties Trust owns 7.8% of outstanding shares of TravelCenters of America.On Feb. 28, Service Properties Trust reported fourth-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.44 beat the analysts’ view by $0.08 and was up 158% from FFO of $0.17 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue of $455.22 million beat the Street view by $10.35 and was 8% ahead of revenue of $421.38 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Although it declined about 17% in March, Service Properties Trust is still up by 40.05% year to date.Life Storage Inc. (NYSE: LSI) is a Buffalo, New York-based self-storage REIT with 1,200 facilities encompassing 68 million square feet across 37 states and Washington, D.C. Life Storage was founded in 1982 as Sovran Self Storage Inc. and operated under the brand name Uncle Bob’s Self-Storage until 2017 when the name was changed to Life Storage.Life Storage jumped from $110.58 to $121.82 on Feb. 6, following a report that Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) had offered to acquire it for $11 billion. Shortly after, Truist analyst Ki Bin Kim noted that there was a strong probability that Public Storage might slightly increase that offer.Ten days later, Life Storage turned down Public Storage’s offer, which was followed by another analyst, Smedes Rose of Citi, commenting that Public Storage has room to raise its offer.On Feb. 23, Life Storage released its fourth-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.69 beat the estimates of $1.07 and was 19.86% above FFO of $1.41 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue of $274.68 million beat the estimates of $269.37 million and was a 24.2% increase over revenue of $221.16 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Between the acquisition offer and good fourth-quarter report, Life Storage has risen 20.2% in 2023.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

This is expected to be March 28, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Micron to post earnings of -$0.65 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 130.37%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.78 billion, down 51.44% from the prior-year quarter.MU's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$2.28 per share and revenue of $16.22 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -127.31% and -47.27%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Micron. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 8.25% lower within the past month. Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The Semiconductor Memory industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 243, putting it in the bottom 4% of all 250+ industries.Story continuesThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

617,9af56752-4932-3e30-ae6c-bee80da8bfc0,MU,2023-03-23,Earnings Preview: Micron (MU) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-micron-mu-q2-140002975.html,1679407202,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -130.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, down 51.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Micron?For Micron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Micron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Micron would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.04, delivering a surprise of -100%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Micron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(MU) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-attracting-130001220.html,1679403601,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has lost 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -130.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of -$2.28 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -127.3%. This estimate has changed -8.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.77 indicates a change of +133.5% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -28.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -51.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.22 billion and $22.55 billion estimates indicate -47.3% and +39.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Everyone has a different threshold, but many would consider anything above 15% to be worth exploring.But what if you find a stock with an ROE of 2,125.60%? That is what we have on the GuruFocus Summary page for Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD), a global specialist in precision instruments and services. It develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of scales, instruments and other products that are used in laboratory, industrial and food service settings.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with SOFI. Click here to check it out. MTD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MTDPeter Lynch Chart of MTDROE is determined by dividing net income by the average total stockholders equity over a certain time period. According to GuruFocus, Mettler-Toledo had annualized net income of $1.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.In the same quarter, it had negative total stockholders equity of $29 million. Heres how GuruFocus came to that conclusion:Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?While the ROE definition page does not explain how it arrived at 2,125.60%, a GuruFocus analyst explained the number on the Summary page is based off its trailing 12-month net income and the five-month average for total stockholders' equity.Moving on from that, I wanted to know why Mettler-Toledo had negative equity for the fourth quarter and what it means for the companys future.Negative equity means a companys total liabilities are greater than its total assets. That is normally something that would make investors nervous.This is a 10-year chart showing total stockholders equity with a negative growth rate averaging 22.10% per year. It also shows how Mettler-Toledos long-term debt has increased by an average of 19.70% per year.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?One result of the displacement of shareholder equity with debt has been an improving weighted average cost of capital to return on invested capital ratio.Story continuesWhy Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?It has also helped the company grow its revenue and net income over the past decade. Looking at the latter, that grew from $291 million in 2012 to $873 million in 2022.At the same time, it has reduced the number of shares outstanding every year for the past 10 years, by an average of 3.27% per year.When we combine a rising net income with a shrinking number of shares, earnings per share should grow relatively quickly. That is what we see in a 10-year chart of Mettler-Toledos earnings per share without non-recurring items.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?That is earnings growth averaging 16.80% per year.Turning to other fundamentals, institutional investors, who normally take a longer-term view, have cut their holdings to some extent. But this is an unusual case. At the end of August 2019, these pension, mutual and other funds held 77.64% of Mettler-Toledos shares; by February 2022, that number had reached 99.16%. Since then, their holdings have dropped to 86.11% as of the end of January 2023 and 80.54% at the end of February.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?Based on 13F filings, there have been more sellers and fewer buyers among the gurus over the past three years.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?Investors should be aware 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.Some of that may have been profit-taking, as Mettler-Toledos share price went into a swoon in early 2022, along with much of the market. Alternatively, it may reflect unease with the companys growing debt burden.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?Still, debt has hardly reached crisis proportions. It has an interest coverage ratio of 20.33 and its Altman Z-Score is robust at 10.52, indicating it is in good standing.GuruFocus awards Mettler-Toledo with full 10 out of 10 rankings for profitability and growth. Its operating and net margins are industry leading at 28.73% and 22.26%. And as mentioned, the ROE is out of this world.Its return on invested capital remains strong and industry leading at 35%. The company has been profitable in every one of the past 10 years.In the growth area, revenue has grown by an average of 12.70% per year over the past three years, while Ebitda growth averaged 19% and earnings per share without NRI growth was 19.60%. A point of caution: while those are all satisfactory growth rates, they are only about average or lag the median of the medical diagnostics and research industry.The growth of revenue and Ebitda has been quite consistent; it receives a 4.5 out of five-star ranking for predictability.Free cash flow has also grown by an average of 17% per year over the past three years and 16.50% per over the past decade.Mettler-Toledo does not pay a dividend, but it has been buying back its own shares, as noted.Share prices are considered fair to overvalued, according to different metrics. The GF Value chart sees intrinsic value of $1,527.29, which is higher that the March 21 midday price of $1,480.43. Nevertheless, the chart considers Mettler-Toledo to be fairly valued currently based on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.Why Is Mettler-Toledo's Return on Equity So High?The price-earnings ratio, at 38.49, is several notches higher than the industry median of 22.11. The five-year Ebitda growth rate averaging 16% per year is not high enough to pull the PEG ratio below the top of the fair range of 2. It is 2.41.At the same time, the share price remains below its all-time high of $1,702.53, which it achieved on Dec. 30, 2021.While the existence of negative equity may be concerning given its trailing 12-month ROE is so high, Mettler-Toledo has a powerful set of fundamentals that could appeal to some growth investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Mettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International How Fast Is Mettler-Toledo International Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Mettler-Toledo International has grown EPS by 20% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Mettler-Toledo International shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 27% to 29% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$482m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Mettler-Toledo International, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.The Mettler-Toledo International CEO received total compensation of just US$6.2m in the year to December 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Mettler-Toledo International Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Mettler-Toledo International's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Mettler-Toledo International has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Mettler-Toledo International , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy. If inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, consumers may have to significantly reduce their spending on non-essential items, which would negatively impact the earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector, such as clothing retailers, luxury brands, and travel firms. However, if inflation eases and the Federal Reserve successfully manages a gentle economic slowdown, these stocks could potentially lead a rebound in the markets. The consumer discretionary sector has already been heavily discounted due to the prevailing pessimism, which could create attractive investment prospects.The performance of different sectors in 2023 is expected to be heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. Investors may react positively to a decrease in inflation and the end of the Fed's rate-hike cycle, but the opposite could prolong uncertainty. The supply and demand balance will also be significant, as frequent price promotions may have a detrimental impact on retailers' profit margins. Nevertheless, consumers with higher incomes, who have more savings and spend a lower proportion of their income on basic living expenses like utilities, may continue to have strong discretionary spending. Some of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy include Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Despite reports of job cuts in the news, overall employment is still increasing. Although the number of people filing for unemployment benefits remains low, the effects of the layoffs will eventually become evident, resulting in a decline in total wages and salaries paid. Nevertheless, the impact of this downturn will be postponed due to past savings. In 2020 and 2021, the majority of the stimulus checks were saved, and higher-than-normal savings rates were also due to more generous unemployment insurance payouts and rising wage rates. Despite some uncertainty as the year progresses, the larger economic trends suggest a positive outlook for consumer spending in 2023. However, by 2024, consumers will have depleted their current earnings and savings, resulting in a significant decrease in discretionary spending. Businesses that sell to consumers should not prematurely reduce their inventory levels. Maintaining sufficient inventory is essential to capitalize on available sales opportunities. Story continuesOur Methodology For this article, we selected consumer discretionary stocks such as furniture companies, travel firms, home appliances providers, fitness-related firms, casinos, and restaurants based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”11.

The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel. We continue to be positive on the company’s long-term prospects.”9. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

(NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We added to our position in made-to-order burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Despite restaurants typically being seen as more sensitive to an economic downturn, the company has consistently been able to exceed expectations through its ability to pass through inflationary increases in both materials and labor through strong pricing power. Chipotle’s investments in digital technology have enabled it to leverage the higher margin delivery business, highlighted by the implementation of “Chipotlanes”, a digital drive through option in suburban areas where customers pay in advance online, to drive significant increases in restaurant volumes.”8.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world’s largest, well-known and fastest growing provider of short-term rental properties via a simple and intuitive online platform. The company has been benefiting from a strong recovery in travel demand so far this year, but shares have been weaker alongside growth stocks in general. Recent results showed nearly 100 million nights booked, up 25% YoY, gross booking value growth of 31% and revenue growth of 29%. We believe Airbnb will continue to generate attractive top-line growth that will outpace that of overall travel. From a demand perspective, we expect the company to continue to maintain its leadership in long-term stays and benefit from a recovery in urban, cross-border and APAC re-opening. The company has rolled out products to improve its value proposition to travelers and hosts, including “Smart Pricing” to ensure its supply continues to provide relative value to consumers, “Aircover for Hosts” to increase supply and “Categories” to better match consumer demand to available supply. Given these profit cycle tailwinds and shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we remain invested.”6. Las Vegas Sands Corp.

After conducting property tours and meeting with management in Macau and Singapore, the firm has expressed greater confidence in the recovery and capital spending for Las Vegas Sands Corp.

As a result, Jefferies has raised its valuation multiple to reflect the accelerating trends in Macau and higher estimates for Marina Bay Sands. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with  2.05 million shares worth $98.7 million. In addition to Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) is one of the top consumer discretionary stocks to watch. ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), in the consumer discretionary sector, which owns and operates several high-profile resorts and casinos in Macau and Singapore. One of the highest probability macro events we anticipate in 2023 is a China reopening, with forecasts (and the Chinese government itself) targeting over 5% growth. A big driver of this growth will be the massive pent-up demand for travel and entertainment after almost three years of being locked down and accumulating a mountain of private savings. We felt that Las Vegas Sands was an attractively-valued opportunity to capture the Chinese reopening, and specifically an eventual rebound in Macau from historically depressed levels. Las Vegas Sands is yet another example of a name supported by strong earnings growth that should generate positive performance, regardless of recession potential, due to the downside protection afforded by its solid free cash flow generation from already reopened destinations in Singapore. When combined with the material upside as earnings and cash flow gap up on a Macau reopening, we believe the risk/reward tradeoff is heavily underappreciated from the market and were able to capitalize and enter the stock at an extremely compelling entry point.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks Disclosure: None. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Digital Currency and Payments Stocks to Buy Now. One aspect of our daily lives that has completely transformed over the past decade or so is payments. The advent of the smartphone and the rise of the internet has brought everyone's bank account right at their fingertips and created new digital wallets where money is stored on the Internet. This enables everyday users to use their smartphones to pay for a wide variety of goods and services and increases the convenience offered to them in their daily lives.This growth in digital payments isn't only a characteristic of the developed world. In fact, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic spurred growth in the digital payments market as it accelerated a shift to online platforms. This growth was not a novel phenomenon, as it simply picked up the pace. McKinsey suggests that non cash retail payment growth in emerging markets is nearly double of the global growth, as it outlines that the sector grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% between 2018 and 2021 globally but significantly outpaced this in the emerging markets by growing at 25%.According to the consulting firm, not only did the pandemic influence these changes, but other factors such as a growth in electronic commerce platforms, government incentives, and investor interest in developing countries all facilitated the change. It bolsters these claims by quoting that electronic commerce volumes grew by 25% globally between 2019 and 2020 - the peak of the pandemic, and will continue to grow by as much as 15% until 2025. Similarly, the strong investor interest was clear through the fact that in Africa, 40% of startup investments were in firms that were developing digital payment platforms.If you thought a 25% growth rate was impressive, wait until you see what Deloitte believes the future holds for digital payments. According to the firm, the global real time payments market was worth $13.5 billion in 2021, and it states that this industry will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% between 2022 and 2030. Deloitte also shares some eye popping figures for the U.S. real time payments market, as it revealed that it is growing by a remarkable 69% annually, as merchant preferences for quick and easy transactions, the rise in popularity of smartphones for both person to person (P2P) and person to business (P2B) transactions, and wider adoption of cloud based services are all at the heart of this explosive growth. Deloitte adds that the best is yet to come for the real time payments industry since the years between 2015 and 2020 were the sector's foundational years as they saw firms develop the right infrastructure to provide the services. Now that the foundation for digital payments has been laid, the sector is primed for ""exceptionally higher adoption and ubiquity of instant payments"" alongside the growth in different payment options available to users, believes Deloitte.Story continuesBuilding on these growth estimates, let's take a broader look at the sector itself. For these purposes, a research report from Grand View Market Research outlines that the global digital payments market was worth $81 billion in 2022. For its growth, Grand View Market's estimate mirrors those shared above since it also sits in the double digits. However, the firm is less optimistic than Deloitte, since it believes that the digital payments industry will 'only' grow at a 20.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 and sit at an estimated $361 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm also shares a stunning estimate for the total amount of digital payments transactions in 2022, as it believes that these stood at a whopping $8 trillion.Finally, while all these firms are painting a highly optimistic picture of the market, it's nonetheless also true that rising inflation in the U.S. has dented consumer purchasing power - an occurrence that will naturally impact the amount of money that flows through the digital payments industry. On this front, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Schulman shared his view of the current environment during his company's earnings call conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 where he highlighted:Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it’s logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed.Today, we'll look at some top digital payments stocks, with the notable picks being PayPal Holdings, Inc.

POS financing – including BNPL, retailer financing and bank financing – represented 2 percent of POS transaction value in 2022, a share it is projected to maintain through 2026.Digital wallets continue to be the leading payment method globally, accounting for 49 percent of transaction value in e-commerce and 32 percent at the POS in 2022.Digital wallets are projected to remain the leading payment method across e-commerce (54 percent) and POS (43 percent) in 2026, with fintechs, banks, neobanks, super apps, Big Tech and device manufacturers all competing as wallet providers.Cash use continues to fall globally, from 26 percent of POS transaction value in 2019 to 16 percent in 2022. By 2026, cash’s share of global POS transaction value is expected to fall to less than 10 percent.U.S. Payment Trends:U.S. consumers continue their long-standing attachment to cards, with cards accounting for more than two-thirds of POS transaction value in 2022 (credit cards with 40 percent, debit cards with 31 percent).Debit cards (20 percent) and credit cards (30 percent) comprised half of e-commerce spend in 2022.Despite the popularity of cards overall, digital wallets became the single leading payment method among U.S. consumers shopping online in 2022, with 32 percent of e-commerce transaction value.U.S. consumers are turning to wallets, but not turning away from cards, with 31 percent of U.S. respondents saying they funded their wallets with credit cards, while 33 percent indicated funding by debit card.""Despite the effects of inflation on consumer spending power and the threat of a global economic slowdown, e-commerce has continued to grow in all regions and markets,"" Johnson added. ""Innovation in payment solutions is running at a hot pace right now, greatly improving the experience for customers, reducing headaches for merchants, and unlocking new avenues for growth. Meeting consumer demand for advanced payments features now can help businesses thrive through economic troubles, while potentially gaining market share from competitors.""About The Global Payments ReportThe Worldpay from FIS Global Payments Report 2023 offers a snapshot of today’s payments landscape: globally, by region and in 40 select markets.

Shaw Group.Fleetcor, which provides fuel cards and workforce payments products, added Rahul Gupta, a veteran board member director and expert in the digital services and payments industry, as a new director.The company and D.E. Shaw will jointly select a second director who will join the board later. The board added technology executive Annabelle Bexiga in January and said it expects one of its ""longer tenured directors will retire,"" later.Fleetcor, which is valued at $14 billion and is headquartered in Atlanta, has seen its stock price drop 22% over the last 52 weeks as investors have become frustrated with how its businesses are linked together.Investors have expressed concern about the fuel card business as the industry shifts more to electric vehicles.On Monday, investors sent the company's stock up more 7% at $201.57 in morning trading.As part of the agreement, the board will review the company's portfolio and create a new committee to review strategic alternatives including the separation or sale of one or more of its businesses.The review will complement an ongoing ""business simplification plan"" and should be finished by the end of 2023, the company said.Ronald Clarke, who has served as Fleetcor's chief executive since 2000, could see his compensation increase significantly if the stock price climbs high enough.According to a regulatory filing, Clarke could earn more than $100 million if the stock price hits $400 a share by the end of 2024. If the stock price does not hit at least $350 a share, Clarke would get nothing.The announcements come after weeks of discussions with D.E. Shaw, which owns an unspecified stake in the company.Story continuesD.E. Shaw, oversees more than $60 billion in assets and occasionally pushes for changes at companies. In December, it reached an agreement with Fidelity National Information Services . Two months later the company announced plans to spin off its Merchant Solutions business, which will be named Worldpay.When D.E. Shaw encourages corporate boards to rethink strategy, the hedge fund prefers to conduct talks out of the limelight and often surfaces publicly only after an agreement has been signed.Last year, D.E. Shaw settled with parcel delivery firm FedEx to add two directors and will have a say in appointing a third one. It pushed Verisk Analytics to become a pure play insurance data business and in October Verisk announced a deal to sell its energy-consulting arm, Wood Mackenzie.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Editing by Louise Heavens and Bill Berkrot)]"

We've got Krispy Kreme, Petco, and Starbucks. Kicking off with Krispy Kreme. Volume on the stock today soaring toward the seven times the typical average here. It's the biggest intraday jump that we have seen in just about 10 months. Now the move higher comes after Truist upgraded Krispy Kreme to a buy. They say that the deal with McDonald's to sell some of its donuts in select restaurants is quote underappreciate-- ""underappreciated"" and could help boost brand awareness and also potentially drive sales.They also think a normalization in the dollar will help Krispy Kreme, given the fact that the company has been growing its international exposure. Now shares has soared since the start of the year, skyrocketing more than, or just around 50% since January 1 here. And Ali, when we take into account everything that has happened with Krispy Kreme, obviously this McDonald's partnership I think is so smart. It's just in Kentucky. I think a lot of people, a lot of investors, shareholders want to know if they're planning to expand it beyond that, say, given the fact that it seems like it has been a success so far.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think they certainly should consider expanding it. And I do agree with this analyst that I think that is a largely underrated part of this business. And you were talking about some of the improvements in foreign exchange. And about a third of Krispy Kreme's sales comes from international markets. So that's a potential tailwind. This analyst also cited the fact that more people are returning to the office as a good play.Also saying that Krispy Kreme is one of the few packaged goods companies to post meaningful volume growth in 2023. So as long as they can continue to add to that top line growth as competitors decelerate, that's a strong move for this buy rating.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, this is really the new fast food wars, is breakfast. Jumping off the McDonald's aspect of this, Wendy's is pouring money into it, Taco Bell is pouring money to it. Obviously, Dunkin' Donuts is pouring money into it. And they're going with breakfast tacos is their new launch. In fact, just launched breakfast tacos today.And Taco Bell's CEO, Mark King, said, we have to go after McDonald's. It represents A billion dollar sales opportunity. We have to commit to beating our rivals. This is really the place to watch. What used to be the chicken sandwich wars I think is now the extra opportunity of breakfast. And that's what to watch for all these fast food companies in the years ahead.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. View our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in McDonald's. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McDonald's Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$86m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy. If inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, consumers may have to significantly reduce their spending on non-essential items, which would negatively impact the earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector, such as clothing retailers, luxury brands, and travel firms. However, if inflation eases and the Federal Reserve successfully manages a gentle economic slowdown, these stocks could potentially lead a rebound in the markets. The consumer discretionary sector has already been heavily discounted due to the prevailing pessimism, which could create attractive investment prospects.The performance of different sectors in 2023 is expected to be heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. Investors may react positively to a decrease in inflation and the end of the Fed's rate-hike cycle, but the opposite could prolong uncertainty. The supply and demand balance will also be significant, as frequent price promotions may have a detrimental impact on retailers' profit margins. Nevertheless, consumers with higher incomes, who have more savings and spend a lower proportion of their income on basic living expenses like utilities, may continue to have strong discretionary spending. Some of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy include Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Despite reports of job cuts in the news, overall employment is still increasing. Although the number of people filing for unemployment benefits remains low, the effects of the layoffs will eventually become evident, resulting in a decline in total wages and salaries paid. Nevertheless, the impact of this downturn will be postponed due to past savings. In 2020 and 2021, the majority of the stimulus checks were saved, and higher-than-normal savings rates were also due to more generous unemployment insurance payouts and rising wage rates. Despite some uncertainty as the year progresses, the larger economic trends suggest a positive outlook for consumer spending in 2023. However, by 2024, consumers will have depleted their current earnings and savings, resulting in a significant decrease in discretionary spending. Businesses that sell to consumers should not prematurely reduce their inventory levels. Maintaining sufficient inventory is essential to capitalize on available sales opportunities. Story continuesOur Methodology For this article, we selected consumer discretionary stocks such as furniture companies, travel firms, home appliances providers, fitness-related firms, casinos, and restaurants based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To BuywithGod/Shutterstock.comBest Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy13. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) manufactures and sells home appliances in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The primary items manufactured by the company include fridges, freezers, ice machines, commercial laundry products, and dishwashers along with their accompanying accessories.

Credit Suisse has revised its estimates for 2023 and 2024 to $15.30 and $16.30, respectively, after the firm's initial note on the company's Q4 results. The 2023 estimate is slightly lower than management's guidance due to Credit Suisse's more conservative outlook on housing turnover, which is a major factor in appliance sales, through 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), with collective stakes worth $842.7 million. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.70 million shares worth $383.15 million. Like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. 12. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) franchises and operates fitness centers under the Planet Fitness brand. The company has three divisions – Franchise, Corporate-Owned Stores, and Equipment. It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 23, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 and a revenue of $281.3 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $9.82 million, respectively. In 2023, the company expects revenue to increase by 13% to 14% as compared to 2022, and earnings per share to increase by 33% to 36%. On February 27, Max Rakhlenko, an analyst at Cowen, increased the company's price target on Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) from $90 to $92 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst noted that the company ended Q4 with positive momentum, and he anticipates robust growth in member numbers for Q1.

(NYSE:PLNT), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Karthik Sarma’s SRS Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 7 million shares worth $548 million. Baron Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), the leading franchiser and operator of low-cost fitness centers, rose after reporting strong results. The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”11. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) operates as a play and entertainment company in the United States and internationally. The company's business is divided into three segments – Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, and Entertainment. On February 13, Hasbro, Inc.

It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 17, DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser maintained a Buy recommendation on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $80 from $95. In a research note to investors, the analyst stated that after announcing a Q4 shortfall, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)’s full-quarter report and 2023 guidance were significantly below expectations. Nonetheless, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has several top-line drivers in 2023, including toys for six blockbuster movies.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $70 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Rising inflation pressuring consumer budgets for discretionary purchases, as well as volatile currency markets, weighed on global entertainment company Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), which owns Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh and other games and brands.  The main detractors from absolute returns were positions in Microsoft, Ball, Intel, Hasbro and McCormick (MKC).”10. Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Next on our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks is Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), which operates as a gaming company in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It operates through three segments – Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas, and Midwest &amp; South. On February 14, Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) declared a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend, a 6.7% increase from its prior dividend of $0.15. The dividend is payable on April 15, to shareholders of record on March 15. On February 9, Susquehanna analyst Joseph Stauff raised the firm's price target on Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) to $80 from $72 and reiterated a Positive rating on the shares.

John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.45 million shares worth $188.50 million. Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of U.S. regional casino operator Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), increased in the fourth quarter due to stable consumer visitation and spending levels despite an uncertain macro environment. The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel. We continue to be positive on the company’s long-term prospects.”9. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. It provides burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, tacos, and salads.

(NYSE:CMG)’s in-restaurant sales increased 17.5%, while digital sales represented 37.4% of food and beverage revenue. According to Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) has faced challenges in maintaining margins due to inflation in industry commodity and labor costs, resulting in the highest level of pricing in four decades. The company has predicted that it will achieve 27% restaurant margins with $3 million sales volumes, a target that both Cowen and consensus forecasts anticipate will be reached in 2024. Despite this, the analyst maintained its Outperform rating and $2040 price target for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shares on February 13. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 45 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square held the largest stake in the company, comprising 1.10 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We added to our position in made-to-order burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Despite restaurants typically being seen as more sensitive to an economic downturn, the company has consistently been able to exceed expectations through its ability to pass through inflationary increases in both materials and labor through strong pricing power. Chipotle’s investments in digital technology have enabled it to leverage the higher margin delivery business, highlighted by the implementation of “Chipotlanes”, a digital drive through option in suburban areas where customers pay in advance online, to drive significant increases in restaurant volumes.”8.

The analyst also believes that MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) has an attractive premium positioning in Las Vegas and in the U.S. regional market.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Keith Meister’s Corvex Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 6.6 million shares worth $223.7 million. Baron Funds made the following comment about MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is a leading global casino and entertainment company with 29 unique hotels and casinos including some of the most recognizable resort brands such as Bellagio, MGM Grand, ARIA, and Park MGM. At its recent price of only $30 per share, we believe MGM’s valuation is compelling at only 6 times 2023 estimated cash flow.”7. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that allows hosts to provide accommodations and experiences to guests worldwide. Through a marketplace model, the company connects hosts and guests via online or mobile devices to book stays and experiences. Airbnb, Inc.

The company expects Q1 2023 revenue of $1.75 billion to $1.82 billion, while the consensus revenue estimate is $1.69 billion. On February 28, Argus upgraded Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $144 price target. The analyst believes that the demand for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) rentals will remain robust due to the trend of longer stays and expansion in urban markets. Additionally, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, growth in Latin America, and early bookings for summer vacations in Europe are expected to benefit Airbnb. Argus has also revised its earnings per share estimates for FY23 and FY24 to $3.60 and $4.00, respectively, up from $3.00 and $3.60.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.85 million shares worth $244.5 million. Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world’s largest, well-known and fastest growing provider of short-term rental properties via a simple and intuitive online platform. The company has been benefiting from a strong recovery in travel demand so far this year, but shares have been weaker alongside growth stocks in general. Recent results showed nearly 100 million nights booked, up 25% YoY, gross booking value growth of 31% and revenue growth of 29%. We believe Airbnb will continue to generate attractive top-line growth that will outpace that of overall travel. From a demand perspective, we expect the company to continue to maintain its leadership in long-term stays and benefit from a recovery in urban, cross-border and APAC re-opening. The company has rolled out products to improve its value proposition to travelers and hosts, including “Smart Pricing” to ensure its supply continues to provide relative value to consumers, “Aircover for Hosts” to increase supply and “Categories” to better match consumer demand to available supply. Given these profit cycle tailwinds and shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we remain invested.”6. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) and its subsidiaries are responsible for creating, owning, and managing all-inclusive resorts in Singapore and Macau. These resorts offer various services including lodging, gambling, entertainment, shopping centers, convention centers, celebrity chef restaurants, and other amenities. On March 13, Jefferies analyst David Katz increased the firm's price target on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) to $66 from $64 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. After conducting property tours and meeting with management in Macau and Singapore, the firm has expressed greater confidence in the recovery and capital spending for Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). As a result, Jefferies has raised its valuation multiple to reflect the accelerating trends in Macau and higher estimates for Marina Bay Sands. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with  2.05 million shares worth $98.7 million. In addition to Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) is one of the top consumer discretionary stocks to watch. ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), in the consumer discretionary sector, which owns and operates several high-profile resorts and casinos in Macau and Singapore. One of the highest probability macro events we anticipate in 2023 is a China reopening, with forecasts (and the Chinese government itself) targeting over 5% growth. A big driver of this growth will be the massive pent-up demand for travel and entertainment after almost three years of being locked down and accumulating a mountain of private savings. We felt that Las Vegas Sands was an attractively-valued opportunity to capture the Chinese reopening, and specifically an eventual rebound in Macau from historically depressed levels. Las Vegas Sands is yet another example of a name supported by strong earnings growth that should generate positive performance, regardless of recession potential, due to the downside protection afforded by its solid free cash flow generation from already reopened destinations in Singapore. When combined with the material upside as earnings and cash flow gap up on a Macau reopening, we believe the risk/reward tradeoff is heavily underappreciated from the market and were able to capitalize and enter the stock at an extremely compelling entry point.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks Disclosure: None. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Tesla (TSLA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.90 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 19, 2023.TSLA has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.76%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.90 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86.TSLA is just one of a large group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with a positive ESP figure. Paccar (PCAR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Paccar is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 25, 2023. PCAR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.71 a share 36 days from its next earnings release.For Paccar, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 is 0.22%.Story continuesTSLA and PCAR's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW remains focused on fortifying its business by enhancing investment capabilities, broadening distribution reach and deepening client partnerships to support long-term growth. However, elevated operating expenses are likely to impede bottom-line growth for the company.Also, analysts are optimistic regarding its earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TROW’s 2023 earnings has been revised 2.6% upward over the past 30 days.Over the past three months, shares of TROW have edged down 0.6% compared with the industry’s 5.2% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Markedly, organic growth remains a key strength at T. Rowe Price, as reflected by its revenue growth story. Net revenues saw a three-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.2%. The company’s efforts to strengthen distribution channels in different geographic regions and improve technology platforms will drive top-line growth.T. Rowe Price has been able to sustain positive earnings throughout the critical period supported by its diverse business model. In December 2021, the company completed the acquisition of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., thereby bulking up its offerings in the alternative investment market space. Going forward, the mix shift toward international growth funds is expected to help increase both revenues and the investment management margin of the company.TROW’s substantial liquidity, which included total cash and investments of $4.08 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, enables capital deployment activities.The company has hiked annual dividends for 37 consecutive years. Also, in 2022, 6.8 million shares were bought back by the firm for $855.3 million. As of 2022 end, it had the authorization to repurchase up to 8,775,217 common shares. Such efforts reflect the company’s commitment to return value to its shareholders with its strong cash generation capabilities.Story continuesHowever, elevated operating expenses are major concerns for T. Rowe Price, with costs escalating at a three-year (ended 2022) CAGR of 9%. The company incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients. This may inflate expenses in the near term and hinder bottom-line expansion.Investment advisory fees are the biggest revenue source for T. Rowe Price. The increased dependence on these can affect the company's financials in the near term, as changes in assets under management due to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations, regulatory changes, or a sudden slowdown in overall business activities can hurt this revenue source.Market-share losses due to the high adoption of passive investments via index funds and exchange traded funds are other concerns. The increasing preference for passive investing has affected the company's new client inflows. Although T. Rowe Price is making efforts to diversify its product mix across other asset classes and geographies, concentration in U.S. equities poses a major risk that can lead to inconsistent asset flows.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Ameriprise Financial AMP and Ares Management ARES.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameriprise Financial’scurrent-year earnings has been unchanged over the past 30 days.

Interestingly, participants have taken slightly more hardship withdrawals (4% more in 2022 verses the 10-year average) but the amount of those withdrawals has decreased by over 20% compared to 2021.The report also found that participants consumed nearly three times more digital retirement educational content in 2022 than in 2021.  The most significant increase was with participants over 50 years old consuming content focused on retirement savings.Key findings from the report include:Participants with 100% invested in a target date product were 15 times less likely to exchange than those with 0% invested in a target date product during Q4 2022Participants who take multiple loans per year have a deferral rate that is lower by an average of 2.3 percentage points than those who do not take multiple loansParticipants who are near retirement and have not taken a hardship withdrawal have an average of three times more in savings than their counterparts who have taken a hardship withdrawal""It's encouraging to see that participants are largely staying the course amid inflation and market volatility,"" said Rachel Weker, senior retirement strategist for Retirement Plan Services at T.

On this front, Law Insider points out that a delivery services company can be accurately defined as follows:Delivery Services means the fulfillment of delivery requests, meaning the pickup from any location of any item or items and the delivery of the items using a passenger vehicle, bicycle, scooter, walking, public transportation, or other similar means of transportation, to a location selected by the customer located within 50 miles of the pickup location. A delivery request may include more than one, but not more than 12, distinct orders placed by different customers. Delivery services may include the selection, collection, or purchase of items by a DNC courier provided that those tasks are done in connection with a delivery that the DNC courier has agreed to deliver. Delivery services do not include deliveries that are subject to Section 26090, as that section read on October 29, 2019.Of course, reading this definition would leave one wondering if firms like FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) are also delivery firms since they accept parcels from countries all over the world. However, both of these are also delivery companies too, since their shipments are made to fulfillment centers which then use passenger vehicles to make deliveries to the end customer.Apart from couriers, the delivery industry has a variety of other components. Two of the most important of these are electronic commerce firms such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which operate their own delivery divisions and food delivery platforms such as DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) which have made an entire business model of connecting restaurants with their hungry customers. Both of these markets are highly lucrative segments, with multiple research reports painting optimistic growth rates for their development.Story continuesStarting from the food delivery industry, a research report from Absolute Reports believes that the online food industry was worth $16.8 billion last year and the firm outlines that this industry will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% until 2028 when it will be worth $31.5 billion. Another report, this time from Grand View Market Research, has vastly more optimistic evaluations for the global online food delivery market. This is evident from the fact that it valued this market at a whopping $189 billion in 2021 and adds that will grow through a CAGR of 10.8% until 2028 to sit at an estimated $388 billion by the end of the forecast period. Within this market, Grand View Market Research points out that Asia Pacific constituted the largest chunk of the market in 2021 as it commanded a 35% share. In terms of market segmentation through platforms, the research firm adds that the platform to consumer delivery, such as UberEats, held a 60% market share in 2021, with the direct restaurant to consumer delivery area believed to outpace the broader market slightly by growing at 11.2% between 2022 and 2028.Just as the shopping industry evolves and technologies such as electronic commerce provide firms with new mediums of disruption, the electronic commerce segment itself has a variety of innovations that are highly sought out. One of these is last mile delivery, which refers to the end consumer's premises such as a home or an apartment building, which is a key evaluation performance for the companies. This segment, namely the electronic commerce last mile delivery market, was worth $56.25 billion in 2021 according to a research report from Spherical Insights. The research firm adds that this segment will grow at an 8.13% CAGR until 2030 to sit at $136 billion by the end of the forecast period. For added reference, Spherical Insights adds that the global electronic commerce market itself will sit at a whopping $4.5 trillion soon, lending credence to the growth in demand for last mile services.To take stock of the situation on the ground, let's turn to a recent earnings call report from DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH). While the growth estimates that we have shared above are impressive on their own, the firm's management shared even stronger estimates during its recent earnings call, as it outlined:So just a couple of data points. Last quarter, we had said our U.S. convenience and grocery business, this was in Q3, had GOV growth of over 80%. That business grew 60% year-on-year in Q4, so it still continues to grow at meaningfully higher growth rates compared to the restaurants. Our third-party U.S. grocery business grew 100% year-on-year, both in Q3 and Q4. And in Wolt, as we alluded to in our shareholder letter, on a constant currency basis has grown 50% year-on-year, which is again significantly faster than its European peers.Today, we'll look at some of the top delivery companies in the market, with the top picks being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP).10 Best Delivery Stocks To Buy Nowpio3 / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo pick out the firms for this piece, we first gathered all the publicly traded firms that offer delivery services.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on United Parcel Service's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:58% = US$12b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.58.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.United Parcel Service's Earnings Growth And 58% ROETo begin with, United Parcel Service has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 21% net income growth seen by United Parcel Service over the past five years isn't overly surprising.As a next step, we compared United Parcel Service's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 18%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if United Parcel Service is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is United Parcel Service Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?United Parcel Service has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 58%, meaning the company only retains 42% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Moreover, United Parcel Service is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 52% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that United Parcel Service's future ROE will drop to 36% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with United Parcel Service's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.” Click to continue reading and see Mario Gabelli's Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None.

NRG continues to expand through organic and inorganic initiatives. The company’s services for a wide variety of customers and focus on emission cuts will boost its long-term growth. NRG’s dividend policy and repurchase of shares will further increase its shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has to face certain headwinds, such as stiff competition in the wholesale power markets and risks related to disruptions in the fuel delivery system.TailwindsRecently, NRG completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, which will form a leading provider in the essential home solutions market and create a unique end-to-end ecosystem, driven by unparalleled data and insights. The deal will also improve and diversify NRG’s financial profile with more predictable earnings through Vivint’s subscription-based model and long-term customer agreements.The company is focusing on clean generation to lower emissions. It targets to achieve a 50% emission cut by 2025 and net-zero emissions by 2050 from the 2014 baseline. NRG entered renewable power purchase agreements totaling 2.4 Gigawatts (GW) with third-party project developers and other counterparties. It continues to optimize its generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development.NRG Energy continues to increase dividend and attract investors. In January 2023, the company declared that its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share, indicating an 8% increase from the previous year. This resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.51 per share. The hike is in sync with the company’s long-term annual dividend growth target rate of 7-9% per share. Capital allocation for 2023-2025 is $6.5-$7 billion, out of which 35-40% will be utilized for share repurchases, around 15% for payment of dividend, 10-15% for Vivint growth, 20-25% for debt reduction and 10% for the Vivint acquisition. The capital allocation plan will further strengthen the company’s balance sheet and increase shareholders’ value over the aforesaid period.Story continuesHeadwindsThe financial performance of NRG's retail operations may suffer from volatile electricity, and gas supply costs and demand. The gas sold by the company in retail and wholesale markets is purchased from third parties. Foreign currency fluctuation and cyber-based security risk may also impede its growth.NRG Energy’s costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be adversely impacted by the disruption in its fuel supplies. This is because the company relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel the majority of its power generation facilities. These facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in power production in case of counterparty failure or a disturbance in the fuel delivery system.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are MGE Energy, Inc.

The Energizing the Future initiative will add to its overall operational strength.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has to face risks related to timely completion of projects, regulations pertaining to coal-fired generation plants and increase in interest rates.TailwindsThe utility’s efforts to expand its regulated generation mix provided stability to its earnings trajectory. In the last few years, the company witnessed a successful broadening of regulated operations and a complete transition into a fully-regulated utility company.FirstEnergy’s strategic investment will help it in serving its six million customers more efficiently. In the past several years, Regulated Distribution has experienced rate base growth through investments. The company’s ‘Energizing the Future’ plan is aimed at enhancing and expanding regulated transmission capabilities. FE plans to invest $11.4 billion in the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its existing operations. During 2023-2025, the company expects to invest $5.9 billion in regulated distribution and $5.4 billion in regulated transmission.The company is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In 2015, FirstEnergy had set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 90% below the 2005 levels within 2045. FE aims to attain 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, with a mid-term goal of 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within the company's direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level. Also, it plans to electrify 30% of vehicle fleet by 2030 and 100% by 2050.FirstEnergy’s board of directors approved a new dividend policy that increases targeted payout ratio to 60-70% from 55-65% previously. It also expects to increase dividend rate in late 2023, subject to the board’s approval.Story continuesHeadwindsFirstEnergy has to comply with environmental regulations for its coal-fired generating plants, which may result in additional expenses. Also, any delay in completion of projects, unfavorable weather and increase in interest rates are headwinds.The company is focused on capitalizing on investment opportunities available for Regulated Transmission and Regulated Distribution segments to provide better services to customers. The success of these opportunities will depend, in part, on the successful recovery of its transmission and distribution investments. It expects a further rise in interest rates in 2023, which will increase the total project costs and decrease the desired profitability.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Here are 2 water treatment stocks to watch now",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/half-global-population-could-face-001714629.html,1679530634,STORY,"['PNR', 'XYL']","[“Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.”So wrote Coleridge, in his epic poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and while most of us probably won’t get trapped in the doldrums on the equator, we probably should give more thought to water.To start with, water shortages are far more common than are usually assumed. As Jim Andrew, chief sustainability officer of PepsiCo, points out, more than 2 billion people worldwide don’t have regular access to safe water for drinking or washing, and another 4 billion people deal with such shortages for at least one month per year. In recent decades, as the global population has increased, so have the pressures on the world’s supply of fresh water. In fact, according to UNICEF, half of the global population could face water scarcity challenges by 2025.As pressures on water systems and supplies increase, it’s only natural that more companies and innovators will step up to meet the challenge – to develop water handling equipment of greater efficiency, able to maintain and move supplies with less waste.Against this backdrop, we’ve looked up the details on two interesting stocks that operate in just this field, producing water handling equipment for a wide range of purposes. According to TipRanks database, these are Buy-rated equities with double-digit upside potential – and even better, each has found recent approval from one of the Street’s 5-star analysts.Xylem, Inc. (XYL)First up is Xylem, a water technology provider based in New York State. The company’s customers include public utilities, industrial firms, and residential, commercial, and agricultural water suppliers, and Xylem does business in over 150 countries. The company works in both water infrastructure and wastewater transport and treatment, and its products include pumps, valves, heat exchangers, dispensing equipment, and treatment and testing equipment.While Xylem’s stock has been volatile lately, the company has shown positive financial results in recent quarters. The most recent report, from 4Q22, tells the story.Story continuesIn that recent quarter, Xylem’s top and bottom line both beat expectations. At the top line, the revenue total of $1.5 billion was $90 million higher than the forecasts, while at the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS of 92 cents beat the forecast by 13 cents, or 16%. On a year-over-year basis, the quarterly revenues were up 13.5%, and the EPS was up 46%.In January of this year, Xylem announced that it had entered a ‘definitive agreement’ to acquire the water treatment technology firm Evoqua. The transaction will be conducted entirely in stock, and the combined entity will have an estimated enterprise value of $7.5 billion.Also of note, earlier this month the City of Buffalo announced that the partnership between the Buffalo Sewer Authority and the Xylem had improved the city’s ability to prevent system overflows, and had contributed to $145 million in savings for the municipality.Covering this stock for Stifel, 5-star analyst Nathan Jones sees the Evoqua deal as a key point, and writes of Xylem’s prospects: “We think Xylem’s clearly laid-out strategy to build the leading global smart water infrastructure company, while significantly improving the operations of the company over the next several years, provides the potential for solid investment returns over the long run in lower-volatility water markets. With the announcement of the acquisition of Evoqua Water Technologies, we believe this is a low risk acquisition and integration with strong opportunity to drive higher growth together than alone coupled with compelling cost synergies opportunities.”For Jones, this adds up to a Buy rating on the shares, and his $124 price target implies a one-year gain of 27% for Xylem. (To watch Jones’ track record, click here)Overall, XYL shares have picked up 9 recent analyst reviews, and these include 4 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $97.57 and its $118.43 average price target suggests an upside potential of 21% on the one-year time frame. (See XYL stock forecast)Pentair plc (PNR)The second water treatment stock we’ll check out is Pentair, a company focused on ‘smart, sustainable water solutions.’ The company markets its products to industrial water management companies, residential and commercial water suppliers, and agribusinesses. Pentair’s product line includes water supply and disposal, pool and spa equipment, water softeners and filters, filter housings, supply and disposal pumps, as well as valves, tanks, and accessories.Pentair has shown a consistent ability to beat its earnings forecasts, and maintained that in its last quarterly report. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company showed a bottom line non-GAAP EPS of 82 cents; while this was down from 87 cents in the prior year quarter, it beat the analyst forecast by 3 cents. At the top line, the company posted quarterly revenues of $1 billion, up a modest 1.45% y/y, and $9.51 million ahead of expectations.Along with these quarterly beats, Pentair finished the year with $364 million in cash from operations and $283 million in annual free cash flow. In February, the company announced its next quarterly dividend payment, scheduled for May 5 at a rate of 22 cents per common share. While the annualized payment of 88 cents only yields a modest 1.66%, the dividend is highly reliable.For Bryan Bair, 5-star analyst with Oppenheimer, the bottom line here is that Pentair holds a solid position in its industry and is likely to continue showing gain.“We view Pentair as well positioned for MSD normalized core growth and margin/returns expansion, with benefits from healthy through-the-cycle market demand (80% resi/non-res water exposure), enhanced focus on innovation/differentiation and digital capabilities, and PIMS cost initiatives supporting above-average EPS growth. We anticipate continued/solid Pool demand (comp-related fears overdone), sustained Water Solutions growth (commercial recovery levered by high-margin Manitowoc Ice), self-help actions, and strategic capital deployment will drive further upside vs. forward earnings and cash flow expectations,” Bair opined.Against this backdrop, it’s no wonder that Bair rates PNR shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $67 implies it has a one-year upside potential of ~30%. (To watch Blair’s track record, click here)All told, Pentair gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 12 recent analyst ratings that break down to 8 Buys, 2 Holds, and 2 Sells. The stock’s average price target of $61.25 implies share appreciation of ~19% from the current trading price of $51.35.

This announcement comes on National Ag Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the abundance provided by American agriculture.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230321005773/en/Haydee Borrero of Sheepy Hollow LLC in Ithaca, New York, is a past grant recipient using the funds to help manage her flock of American Romney sheep. (Photo: Business Wire)The donation will support AFT’s Brighter Future Fund, providing 85 grants of $10,000 each to help farmers improve farm viability; access, transfer or permanently protect farmland; and adopt regenerative agricultural practices. Applicants may include one or more individual farmer(s) or farm families. Grants will primarily be awarded to those who have been historically underserved or lack access to traditional methods of funding. Applications open on July 1.""Agricultural communities are the foundation of Tractor Supply’s 85 years in business, and we are delighted to give back to them as we celebrate this milestone,"" said Hal Lawton, president and CEO of Tractor Supply. ""This donation is an expression of gratitude to our customers and the communities we call home. It is also critical to fulfilling our duty as responsible stewards of the environment as America’s farmers play a key role in helping protect our natural resources. We’re honored to contribute to AFT’s important work, ensuring that future generations can live Life Out Here.""The $850,000 donation is Tractor Supply’s most significant gift to AFT to date. The company first partnered with AFT in 2020 through the Farmer Relief Fund at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tractor Supply also donated to AFT’s Brighter Future Fund in 2021 and 2022. Tractor Supply’s support of the Brighter Future Fund builds on initial underwriting from Tillamook County Creamery Association.Story continues""AFT is grateful for Tractor Supply’s generous gift and the significant impact these funds will have for awardees. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers work hard and face daily obstacles related to weather, changing economic forces, and the rising costs of land and inputs. AFT just reached $5 million in grants awarded to farmers and ranchers to advance our mission to protect farmland, promote sound farming practices and keep farmers on the land,"" said John Piotti, AFT president and CEO. ""AFT’s grants help drive new solutions for resolving key challenges facing our society by increasing the resilience of farms to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening local food systems, creating greater equity in opportunities for underserved farmers, ensuring the availability of sufficient clean water and habitat for threatened wildlife, and improving farm viability and community vitality.""Since 2020, AFT has made grants to farmers and ranchers in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Past Brighter Future Fund recipients include:Rebecca Stimpert of Heartland Farm in Bucklin, Kansas, whose family raises cucumbers, summer squash, beets, beans, tomatoes and okra to make and sell 15 kinds of pickles. Those sales finance the Farm Service Agency loan used to purchase their farmland, which had been in her husband’s family for generations. Additional funding will help replace inefficient and outdated fertilization and irrigation systems and support the purchase of new farming equipment.Haydee Borrero of Sheepy Hollow LLC in Ithaca, New York, who runs a mixed-use farm as the sole full-time worker. Brighter Future Fund support allowed Haydee to purchase a handling system to conduct routine health checks and treatment protocols for her flock of American Romney sheep. These sheep can grow to be more than 220 pounds, making them unwieldy to manage. The handling system will help make the farm a safer workplace and a more efficient livestock producer.Rafael Vencio of AmBoy Urban Collective LLC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who farms a quarter acre of land at Hilltop Urban Farm Incubator as part of a four-year tenure. He is working on growing Asian cultivars and heirloom varieties to introduce Filipino cuisine to the community. Rafael plans to use the funds for capital costs to maintain the soil and install drip irrigation and fencing. He will also use it toward transaction costs in securing the lease for the year.Agriculture is one of Tractor Supply’s four focus pillars of corporate giving, with an emphasis on supporting agriculture education for future generations through FFA and 4-H.

With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Tractor Supply, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tractor Supply?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Tractor Supply. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Tractor Supply's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Tractor Supply is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.1% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Tractor SupplyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Tractor Supply Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$64m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.65% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 6.65%.Coming into today, shares of the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum had gained 1.85% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 0.41%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Mondelez as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Mondelez is projected to report earnings of $0.80 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.76%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.44 billion, up 8.76% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.16 per share and revenue of $34.23 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.12% and +8.67%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Mondelez should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.25% lower.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Marine Harvest ASA and Mondelez are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.MHGVY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.47, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 21.38. We also note that MHGVY has a PEG ratio of 1.89. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 3.Another notable valuation metric for MHGVY is its P/B ratio of 2.23. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 3.44.These metrics, and several others, help MHGVY earn a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth MHGVY and MDLZ are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that MHGVY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.89 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 19, 2023.Liberty Oilfield Services' Earnings ESP sits at 9.13%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82.LBRT is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Occidental Petroleum, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.42 a share, and OXY is 50 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Occidental Petroleum is $1.41, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.87%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LBRT and OXY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

681,07a010d9-9d31-314b-aef2-e37cc21f31ce,OXY,2023-03-23,"With 58% ownership, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/58-ownership-occidental-petroleum-corporation-120029007.html,1679313629,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Occidental Petroleum implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Occidental Petroleum. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Occidental Petroleum already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Occidental Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 22% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 6.8% of the stock.On looking further, we found that 50% of the shares are owned by the top 5 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$119m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 22% of Occidental Petroleum stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

New strategic investments to drive electrophysiology are boosting investors’ optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 8.2% against a 41.4% fall of the industry and an 13.3% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $69.3 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 11.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 14.6%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayImpressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term.In Feb 2022, Boston Scientific purchased Baylis Medical Company. The Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated Transseptal access and it remains on track to achieve its full-year expectations. In the fourth quarter, sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points to Boston Scientific’s top line.New Strategic Investments to Drive Electrophysiology: We are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s acquisition of Farapulse, a leader in pulsed field ablation, an emerging field that has the potential to improve safety, efficacy, and ease of use for cardiac ablation procedures. This acquisition complements Boston Scientific’s electrophysiology portfolio and will incorporate the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) System. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company noted that the early Farapulse launch has been progressing in Europe, as physicians remain enthusiastic about this technology’s safety and ease.During the fourth quarter, the company’s EP sales were up 25% organically year over year, led by the strength and differentiation of Boston Scientific’s portfolio. The results also include a full-quarter contribution from FARAPULSE. Physician demand for POLARx in Japan and FARAPULSE and POLARx in Europe remained strong in the quarter.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Goals Look Impressive:  The company aims to improve its clinical and economic outcomes, sustaining category leadership in served markets and expanding into high-growth, adjacent markets. The plan focuses on spaces like category leadership strategy, product diversification into faster-growth markets and expansion of portfolio and capabilities across geographies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn 2022, Boston Scientific announced a change in its leadership structure to enhance customer focus and further enable our strategies. According to the company, this new structure supports agile business practices and drives collaboration and innovation across its similar call points.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific recording 47% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players too.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.91 per share, indicating an 11.7% increase from the 2022 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $13.47 billion, suggesting a 6.2% rise from the 2022 figure.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Haemonetics Corporation HAE, TerrAscend Corp. TRSSF and Akerna Corp. KERN. Haemonetics and TerrAscend both sport a Zacks Rank #1, while Akerna carries a Zack Rank #2 (Buy).

GOOGL, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, Amgen Inc. AMGN, FedEx Corp. FDX and Capital One Financial Corp. COFHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Alphabet, Tesla and AmgenThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Amgen Inc.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Alphabet were in line with the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past six months (+2.3% vs. +2.4%). The company's fourth quarter results were driven by its strength in the cloud business. Solid momentum across Other Bets segment was a positive. Its robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.Also, strong focus on AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth. The company's growing efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Its deepening focus on its wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.However, sluggishness in the company's advertisement business remains a major headwind. Declining YouTube and Network advertising revenues are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Tesla have declined -41.3% over the past year against the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry's decline of -46.3%. The company is facing inflation and economic concerns, which could pose near-term challenges, The Zacks analyst expects Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and the introduction of new models.Nevertheless, though Tesla witnessed a massive sell-off last year, its shares have seen a sharp rebound of late. The company's long-term prospects remain solid. The electric vehicle (EV) king is set to benefit from the soaring popularity of its Models 3 and Y. We expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 33% in 2023.Production ramp-ups at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and the introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. Additionally, Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. Falling debt levels is another positive.(You can read the full research report on Tesla here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Amgen's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (+2.4% vs. +0.4%). The company beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. Amgen is rapidly advancing its robust pipeline. The acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a strategic new growth asset, Tavneos, to Amgen's portfolio.Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio with potential new products expected to drive long-term growth. While key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Evenity are driving sales, increasing competition for its legacy products is hurting the same.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen's products including some biosimilars. Increasing biosimilar competition for some legacy products and weakness in key brands like Otezla and Lumakras, create potential revenue headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corp.and Capital One Financial Corp..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Ulta Beauty is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.44 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$5.4b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).So, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 44%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 16% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ulta Beauty compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Ulta Beauty's ROCE Trend?The trends we've noticed at Ulta Beauty are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 44%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 63%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Ulta Beauty thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.What We Can Learn From Ulta Beauty's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that Ulta Beauty is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation.

Genomic editing, using the CRISPR technology to repair a defective disease-causing genetic material, is one of the most promising and exciting healthcare innovations till date. There are only a handful of companies making medicines using this revolutionary technology and CRISPR Therapeutics is one of them.The company’s lead pipeline candidate, exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), is being developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX in late-stage studies to treat transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD).Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Below, we discuss four reasons why adding CRISPR Therapeutics stock to your portfolio may prove beneficial in 2023.Favorable Share Price Movement: Encouraging development of gene editing therapies has enabled the company to outperform the industry. Shares of the company have rallied 9.4% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s 6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExa-cel Studies Progressing Well: Exa-cel is CRISPR’s lead product candidate, being developed in partnership with Vertex. In November 2022, both the companies started a rolling biologics licensing application (BLA) submission with the FDA, seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications. The companies expect to complete the submission by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have also filed similar submissions on exa-cel in Europe and the United Kingdom.If approved, exa-cel will be the first CRISPR-based therapy in the world. Also, the company expects to start recording sales from this product candidate in early 2024.Immuno-Oncology Programs Picking Up Pace: CRISPR is also developing two chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy candidates — CTX110 and CTX130 — for haematological and solid-tumor cancers.Story continuesCTX110 is the company’s lead immune-oncology product candidate. Management is evaluating the safety and efficacy of CTX130 in two ongoing phase I studies for treating solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma and B-cell hematologic malignancies. The preliminary data from both the studies has been encouraging.CRSP plans to start early-stage studies on new CAR-T candidates, CTX112 (targeting CD19 antigen) and CTX131 (targeting CD70 antigen), in the first half of 2023.Encouraging Collaboration Contracts: CRISPR has entered into collaboration contracts for developing gene editing therapies for treating cancer and various neurological conditions. Its partnership with Vertex in 2015 has been expanding ever since.Apart from exa-cel, both the companies are also working on developing therapies in cystic fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1). The company’s top line is mainly driven by collaboration revenues and milestone payments from Vertex.CRISPR has partnered with ViaCyte to develop/commercialize gene-edited allogeneic stem cell therapies for treating diabetes. It has also collaborated with Nkarta to develop gene-editing natural killer cell product candidates.Conclusion: In the absence of a marketed product, the company is solely dependent on Vertex for collaboration revenues. Competition is a concern since other companies in the market are also developing gene-editing therapies. One such company is Editas Medicine EDIT. EDIT’s lead candidate EDIT-301 is also being developed to treat SCD and TDT indications. The said candidate of EDIT is in early-stage development. Exa-cel development remains the key driver for CRISPR’s growth. Collaboration revenues and milestone payments boost the company’s top line.CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and Consensus CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and ConsensusCRISPR Therapeutics AG price-consensus-chart | CRISPR Therapeutics AG Quote Another Stock to Consider                                                                                 Another top-ranked stock in the same sector is Jasper Therapeutics JSPR, holding a Zacks Rank #2.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Vertex currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 70.6% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VRTXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VRTXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Vertex here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Vertex, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in VRTX?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Vertex, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.8% over the past month to $14.18.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Vertex. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Vertex with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here are some comments from Roman Schweizer about the U.S. defense budget, potential budget cuts, and defense stocks:""I'd say that the group (defense stocks) has underperformed, since the GOP (Republicans) kinda came out with wanting those what would be potentially 10% spending cuts. Really, when you look at the backlog in spending, 2 years ago the budget was up 7%, last year up 10%. We estimate there's about $37 billion in funds for Ukraine that haven't been put on contract for some of the large defense primes. So the pump is primed and as soon as we get into some of the budgetary details, if any of that overhang lifts, it certainly is gonna bode well for the companies.""Roman Schweizer is positive on the defense sector and sees it driving outperformance. Schweizer thinks the consensus is that the Ukraine war is a ""multi-year conflict"" and defense spending is going up in not just the U.S., but also in Japan and Europe. Schweizer also noted that the supply-chain issues and labor shortages due to COVID-19 are also fading away and the defense sector is ""starting to operate better"". Finally, Roman Schweizer said that he thinks ""there's a pretty good long-term setup"" for defense stocks.Story continuesAs the Ukraine war enters its second year, geopolitical risk is rising and defense spending is going up with it. On March 13, the U.S. Department of Defense released the proposed defense budget for fiscal 2024.

(NYSE:MSGS) rebounded following the recent sale of the Phoenix Suns (NBA). This recent share appreciation suggests MSGS’ franchises could realize outsized returns due to the prominence of the New York Knicks (NBA) and the New York Rangers (NHL) in the largest U.S. market, particularly given high demand and the large premiums other sports franchises have traded at.”8.

The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.” Click to continue reading and see Mario Gabelli's Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None.

703,32e912bf-962c-3933-ad2a-97dfcc64cdd2,TXT,2023-03-23,7 Aerospace Stocks to Buy for the Future of Flight,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-aerospace-stocks-buy-future-205752493.html,1679086672,STORY,"['ESLT.TA', 'SPR', 'TXT']","[The aerospace industry primarily surrounds companies involved in the manufacturing of aircraft components and vehicles that travel into and beyond the earth’s atmosphere. Aerospace stocks range from private firms focused on commercial space travel to large defense firms that supply our military. Accordingly, these companies are all determined to provide innovative products and services that address the future of flight.What does that future look like? The answer involves anything from hydrogen-powered vehicles to wing design that goes beyond traditional norms, supersonic flight, and advanced materials that push new boundaries.Indeed, aerospace stocks provide investors with potential exposure to an inherently fascinating field that feels poised for massive growth. As humans continue to do what we do best – explore and push boundaries – these aerospace stocks could lead the way higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWithout further ado, let’s dive into three of the top aerospace stocks investors ought to consider right now.TXTTextron$66.16ESLTElbit Systems$171.58SPRSpirit AeroSystems$29.72AVAVAeroVironment$90.39RKLBRocket Lab USA$3.88TGITriumph Group$10.59ACHRArcher Aviation$2.53Textron (TXT)Two individuals step out of a helicopter while the pilot stands nearby.Source: ShutterstockPrice Target: $83.41 (20.3% Upside)First on this list of aerospace stocks to buy is Textron (NYSE:TXT), a family of 6 businesses primarily focused on aviation, specialized terrestrial vehicles, and turf care. Many aviation stock fans will recognize its commercial and military helicopter brand, Bell. Likewise, its Cessna and Beechcraft planes are well-known names in the aviation industry.Textron continues to develop its aerospace capabilities. In September, it entered into an agreement with Sierra Nevada Corporation to co-develop a High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) aircraft. The aircraft has military applicability, rather than strict commercial aerospace use, and is designed to strengthen domestic operational capabilities.Story continuesBack in 2020, the company announced an apprenticeship program with Wichita State University Tech and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW). That program will train future workers in an area rich in aerospace talent and manufacturing.Perhaps equally importantly, the company won a contract to replace the Army’s UH-40 Black Hawk helicopter in December with the Bell V-280 Valor. That $80 billion contract will stabilize revenues and beat out bids from larger contractors, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).Elbit Systems (ESLT)Gold shield; digital shield, defense, protectionSource: anttoniart / ShutterstockPrice Target: $213.33 (22.3% Upside)Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT) stock represents an Israeli-based firm operating in programmatic defense and homeland security. Those programs touch on all major military branches, including naval, terrestrial, aerial systems, and munitions, in the aerospace realm, including unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and associated systems for their operation.Elbit Systems’ unmanned vehicles comprise at least eight large aerial vehicles that fly long-range at high altitudes and cars that can be hand-launched by a single person. That vehicle, the Skylark I-LEX, can handle a 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) payload and has a 40 km (25 miles) range. The Starliner Hermes, its largest craft, can travel for 36 hours continuously and carry a 450 kg (990 lb.) payload.Elbit Systems Space IMINT Systems division produces space telescopes, cameras, and other space-borne electro-optic observation systems. In short, ESLT stock is a lesser-known aerospace name, but one with an attractive upside that is developing futuristic technology that leads the sector. The company also produces composite parts for the F-35 fighter from its Cyclone materials division.Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)The Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) website displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comPrice Target: $40.14 (31.7% Upside)Spirit AeroSystems’ (NYSE:SPR) primary business is manufacturing aluminum and advanced composite materials. The company stock is bolstered by its capabilities as one of the largest aerostructure manufacturers to commercial airplane firms.The company represents the growth side of aerospace and defense stocks. It posted a loss of $546 million in 2022, up from $541 million in 2021. But, as mentioned, Spirit AeroSystems boasts impressive growth numbers. Revenues increased by 27% in 2022, reaching $5.06 billion. In Q4, they improved by 23%, rising to $1.32 billion.CEO Tom Gentile noted supply chain issues and labor losses contributing to the less-than-stellar operational figures. Yet, investors will likely be able to sweep those losses aside, given that the company has a vital catalyst in its favor – the 737 program. Spirit AeroSystems is on track to deliver 420 shipsets in 2023. A shipset amounts to the total product required to manufacture a single plane.AeroVironment (AVAV)a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocksSource: ShutterstockPrice Target: $104.83 (18.1% Upside)Investors seeking stocks heavily involved with unmanned aircraft solutions (UAS) will like AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV). The company is a global leader in intelligent, multi-domain robotic systems. In layman’s terms, it makes small and medium-range drones, missiles, and satellites.The company is a significant supplier to Ukraine in the war against Russia. That connection has substantially boosted business for AeroVironment, with revenues jumping 13% in 2022, to $354.5 million. In Q3, which ended in late January of this year, the increase was even more pronounced. Revenues rose 49% to $134.4 million.That growth is expected to continue throughout 2023, with revenues expected to come in between $510 and $525 million. That projected growth will be a significant catalyst for investors. Moreover, investors should understand that the company is approaching breakeven. Several of the company’s uncrewed aircraft are featuring heavily in the Ukraine conflict, and have been a significant force in surveilling enemy soldiers and delivering payloads.Rocket Lab USA (RKLB)An image of a rocket launching to spaceSource: Alexyz3d/ShutterstockPrice Target: $9.33 (142.3% Upside)Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) is a reasonable choice for penny stock enthusiasts seeking aerospace plays. The Long Beach, California firm engineers rocket launch and control systems for space and defense clientele. It also provides on-orbit management solutions that promise to lower space access costs.Indeed, 2022 was a big year for Rocket Lab USA. The company successfully launched 100% of its more than 42 commercial satellites into precise orbits. Its Electron rockets are the second-most frequently used vehicles to propel satellites into orbit. This year, one such rocket was used to launch a successful moon mission for NASA. The company operates three launchpads from the USA and New Zealand.Rocket Lab USA currently boasts 25+ spacecraft in development, which includes a NASA mission to Mars. Its backlog stood at $503.6 million at the end of Q4. That positive momentum, and an impressive projected book of business, make it a stock with significant upside from here.Triumph Group (TGI)An image of a futuristic aerospace engine renderingSource: solarseven / ShutterstockPrice Target: $13.2 (17.2% Upside)Aerostructure and aircraft component firm Triumph Group (NYSE:TGI) is another small name stock with plenty of upside potential. It serves many of the world’s largest airline and aerospace firms. For example, the company recently won a contract to supply door actuator cables to Airbus. Its helicopter main and tail rotor controls business was also recently awarded a developmental contract.In my mind, its recent turnaround makes Triumph Group an attractive investment. The company drew down liquidity from $240.87 million to $116.4 million between March and Dec. 31 of last year. The top-line result of that move appears a bit deceptive, as revenues declined slightly to $985.84 million.However, the company has pivoted from a $32.18 million loss at the end of 2021 to a $107.14 million net gain at the end of 2022. Its operations are in much better order, and it continues to win contracts with significant firms, which are major positives.Archer Aviation (ACHR)The logo for Archer Aviation (ACHR) displayed on a smartphone.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comPrice Target: $9.40 (209.2% Upside)Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is a stock for investors in the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) space. The company unveiled its Midnight production aircraft in November. That vehicle is close to final assembly.That’s where investors will be placing their money – the production of the Midnight eVTOL. Archer Aviation is currently constructing its volume production plant in Covington, GA. And the company has developed a strong relationship with Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), which could be instrumental.So, it’s an early-stage bet that the company can successfully manufacture and commercialize its vehicles. High risk? Sure. But the payoff potential is evident as well.Unsurprisingly, Archer Aviation remains pre-revenue, given that it is on the cusp of production. It will be a race against using current investments to develop the business to create future revenue streams. That means leveraging $531.2 million in liquidity for a company that burned through $347.4 million in 2022.Penny StocksOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

Senators questioned Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Alan Shaw for the second time this month and he backed calls for rail safety reform but did not endorse a bipartisan bill.""We can't have railroads adopt operating models focused on just cutting costs to achieve higher profits and then have higher accident rates,"" Cantwell said. ""We need to invest in the modernization of equipment that will provide the safety we need.""This month, a bipartisan group of senators led by Ohio's Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and J.D. Vance, a Republican, introduced legislation to prevent future train disasters.The bill would require enhanced safety procedures for trains carrying hazardous materials, as well as require wayside defect detectors, a minimum of two-person crews and increased fines for wrongdoing.Vance ridiculed suggestions by industry groups that the bill was a ""big government solution"" and said it was ""insulting to the people of East Palestine.""Shaw did not endorse major provisions of the legislation such as requiring two-person crews or hiking maximum civil penalties for railroads from $225,000 to 1% of annual operating income. He said the railroad supports regulator reviews of rules for rail car inspections and standards for freight car safety and accelerating the phase-out of older tank cars.Brown said Norfolk Southern had 579 violations in a recent 12-monht period in closed cases and an average fine of less than $3,300. Brown said the fines are ""meaningless. It’s not even a cost of doing business – it’s a rounding error.""Story continuesSenator Ted Cruz, top Republican on the Commerce Committee, said he thinks Congress can pass legislation to boost rail safety without damaging supply chains or imposing unreasonable costs.Senator Peter Welch pressed Shaw to suspend Norfolk Southern's stock buyback program but the CEO did not endorse the suggestion. ""We spend a $1 billion a year on capital on safety,"" Shaw said. ""Stock buybacks never come at the expense of safety.""Norfolk Southern repurchased $3.1 billion in stock in 2022 after buying back $3.4 billion in 2021. The company in March 2022 announced a buyback authorization of up to $10 billion. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Under aggressive questioning from senators earlier this month in a separate hearing, he committed to voluntary safety upgrades and earnestly apologized for the derailment that upended life in East Palestine, Ohio. But Shaw had stopped short of endorsing proposed safety regulations under the Railway Safety Act of 2023.This time, Shaw says in prepared remarks released Tuesday that Norfolk Southern will “support legislative efforts to enhance the safety of the freight rail industry."" But he does not address several key provisions of the Railway Safety Act, including increased fines for safety violations and designating trains that carry flammable liquids as highly hazardous.Shaw supports provisions in the act for railroads to fund training for emergency crews, a review of regulations for rail care inspections every three years and accelerating the phaseout of older tank car models.Shaw also says there are “areas in which we believe Congress could go further with safety legislation,"" including stricter standards for tank car design and research into technology that would detect problems with rail cars.No one was immediately injured in the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, but state and local officials decided to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars, prompting the evacuation of half of the roughly 5,000 residents. Scenes of billowing smoke above the village, alongside reports from residents that they still suffer from illnesses, have turned high-level attention to railroad safety and how dangerous materials are transported.Story continuesThe Senate Commerce Committee will also hear from the National Transportation Safety Board chair ​​Jennifer Homendy. The NTSB — as well as the Federal Railroad Administration — are investigating the East Palestine derailment and Norfolk Southern's safety practices.In prepared remarks, Homendy says that “rail remains one of the safest means of transportation,” but also points to several safety shortcomings in current regulations, including that local emergency responders are not regularly told what hazardous materials are carried on trains if they don't qualify as a high-hazard flammable train.The train that derailed in East Palestine was not classified as highly hazardous because it fell under the threshold for the number of cars carrying a combustible liquid, such as gasoline, ethanol or acetone.Homendy will push for a broader definition of high-hazard flammable trains, saying it “should include a broad range of hazardous materials"" and “that even one railcar of any hazardous material justifies notifying emergency responders.”Senators will also hear from an organization representing railroads, an East Palestine resident and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, as well as the two Ohio senators pushing the Railway Safety Act — Republican JD Vance and Democrat Sherrod Brown.In the House, Republican Reps. Bill Johnson, whose district includes East Palestine, and Emilia Strong Sykes, an Ohio Democrat, have introduced a separate version of a railroad safety bill.Both senators, as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have been outspoken critics of Norfolk Southern. Vance, who holds a seat on the Senate Commerce Committee, circulated a memo to his fellow Republicans on the panel this week to push them to focus the hearing on the new safety regulations, including questioning Shaw on whether he supports increased fines for safety violations.In the memo, Vance suggests that Shaw be asked whether the penalties should be stepped up “when a railroad company poisons an entire community.”Vance also met with Shaw on Tuesday ahead of the hearing and told The Associated Press it was a “productive conversation.” But he added that he wanted to see the company endorse the increased fines, enhanced hazardous material reporting requirements and a mandate that detectors be installed every 10 miles (16 kilometers) to monitor for overheated bearings like the ones that caused the East Palestine derailment.“It's important if these guys really want to show commitment to rail safety, to endorse the legislation,” Vance said. “You don’t have to endorse every single piece of it, but to endorse the broad thrust of what we’re trying to do is important.”]"

709,ac5349cf-11b3-3fb2-a8da-f18a8d436382,NSC,2023-03-23,Safety board: Alabama derailed train lacked needed couplers,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/safety-board-alabama-derailed-train-234911971.html,1679356151,STORY,['NSC'],"[SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — A Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Alabama earlier this month lacked required alignment control couplers for two of its locomotives and a company inspection did not identify their absence, federal investigators said Monday.The notation comes in one of three preliminary reports issued Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board about Norfolk Southern train accidents this month as the board investigates the railroad’s safety practices after the fiery February derailment and toxic chemical burn in East Palestine, Ohio.In a report released Monday about a March 9 derailment of two locomotives and 37 rail cars in Anniston, Alabama, the safety board said two of the train’s six locomotives were “waybill locomotives,” or towed cars not used for any tractive power. The cars weren’t equipped with alignment control couplers that “resist lateral coupler movement under compressive in-train forces.” A company rule bars towing waybill locomotives without such couplers, the report said.The waybill locomotives were coupled together and picked up from Bluffton, Indiana, on Feb. 24 and a Norfolk Southern inspection before the first movement involving the coupled locomotives “did not identify the absence of alignment control couplers,” the safety board said.A company spokesperson said in an e-mail Monday that “these locomotives were not owned by Norfolk Southern and the couplers on these locomotives are not common on our network.”“We have taken immediate action to update our manuals with photos and details to implement training with our crews. Safety is a priority at NS and we’ll continue working with the NTSB to identify the final cause of this derailment and implement any other necessary changes,” said Connor Spielmaker, a senior communications manager with Norfolk Southern.No injuries were reported; three derailed tank cars were carrying hazardous material residue but all remained intact, the report said. The safety board said future investigation will focus on Norfolk Southern “communication, maintenance, and inspection practices” as well as locomotive and railcar positioning and train handling.Story continuesThe safety board also said it was examining industry-wide standards and practices regarding railcar wheel and axle assemblies after a train derailment in Ohio earlier this month. Eight wheelsets were recovered from two of the 28 Norfolk Southern railcars that derailed March 4 near Springfield. Photographs taken after the derailment showed three wheels from the eight wheelsets “exhibited movement on their axles,” the board said.Five days after that derailment, the Association of American Railroads issued an equipment inspection order advising railroads to remove from service — wheelsets mounted by National Steel Car between August and March. The association said railroads nationwide initially identified 675 cars affected by the advisory and pulled them off the tracks.The wheelsets and other material from the crash along with wheelsets from elsewhere in the Norfolk Southern fleet have been undergoing analysis since last Wednesday at a Norfolk Southern facility in Altoona, the safety board said.“Future investigative activity will focus on failure analysis of the subject wheelsets and on industry-wide standards and practices for railcar wheel and axle assembly processes, specifications, and quality control,” the safety board said Monday.Soon after the Springfield crash, the safety board announced a broad look at Norfolk Southern's safety culture — the first such investigation within the rail industry since 2014 — and said it had sent investigation teams to look into five significant accidents involving Norfolk Southern since December 2021.In a preliminary report on a March 7 accident that killed a Norfolk Southern conductor when a train and dump truck collided as they simultaneously entered a private rail crossing at a Cleveland steel plant, the safety board said the train was going 9 mph (14 kph), less than the 10 mph (16 kph) limit within the Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. steel plant. The Federal Railroad administration later urged proper training, oversight and crew communication at highway–railroad grade crossings.Following the Feb. 3 derailment outside East Palestine, Ohio, Norfolk Southern announced plans to improve the use of detectors placed along railroad tracks to spot overheating bearings and other problems. Investigators have said the crew got a warning from such a detector but couldn’t stop the train before more than three dozen cars came off the tracks and caught fire.Half of the town of about 5,000 had to evacuate for days when responders intentionally burned toxic chemicals in some derailed cars to prevent an uncontrolled explosion, leaving residents with lingering health concerns. Government officials say tests haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area.]"

Here's the one powerful technique that made Grace Groner rich — and can change your life tooGrace Groner worked as a secretary for medical device giant Abbott Laboratories for 43 years. She lived in a tiny one-bedroom cottage, didn’t own a car and bought her clothes at rummage sales.So when she passed away in 2010 at the age of 100 and left her estate to her alma mater, Lake Forest College in Illinois, the story made headlines. ""Oh, my God,"" the school’s president said after finding out the amount, the Chicago Tribune reported.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsGroner built her wealth using a very simple strategy. While she was working at Abbott in 1935, she decided to purchase three shares of the company. At the time, they were trading at around $60 each, for a total investment of $180 — a fair amount of money back then, but far from an extravagant investment.She held on to those shares. When the stock split, she didn’t sell them. When the company paid dividends, she used the cash to buy more shares of Abbott.Fast forward decades later and that small $180 investment had grown to more than $7 million.The strategy for people who want to earn passive income from stocks is simple, but powerful: Find stocks that pay strong dividends, let them sit and reinvest the regular payouts.Of course, not all dividend stocks are the same. Here’s a look at three companies with long track records of paying reliable — and increasing — dividends.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola (KO) is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Story continuesAdd solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.More impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 3.1%.Johnson &amp; JohnsonWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Read more: Here's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?Not only does Johnson &amp; Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.The stock has been trending up for decades, all while returning an increasing amount of cash to shareholders. JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase last April and now yields 3.0%.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble (PG) has an even longer dividend growth track record than Coca-Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson: the company has raised its payout to shareholders for 66 consecutive years.That streak is a testament to its entrenched position in the consumer staples market. P&amp;G has a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent.These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. As a result, the company can deliver reliable dividends even in tough times.The latest dividend hike was announced in April 2022, when the board of directors approved a 5% increase to the quarterly payout to 91.33 cents per share. The stock currently yields 2.5%.What to read nextWhat do Ashton Kutcher and a Nobel Prize-winning economist have in common?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential. In the current inflationary environment, dividend stocks help reduce a portfolio’s volatility and provide a hedge against inflation. Companies that have raised their dividends over time become top choices for investors as they can generate regular income for them. Moreover, investors can also grow their income through investing in these companies as they consistently raise their payouts. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which represents companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the broader market by over 75% from 1989 through January 2023, as reported by T. Rowe Price.In addition to dividend growers, high-dividend stocks are also popular among investors considering their historical performance during market downturns. According to a report by Charles Schwab, high-dividend payers outperformed their peers in every recessionary period in the past 50 years, except for the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The report revealed that the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index returned 6% from 1976 to 1978, compared with a 4.2% decline in the MSCI World Index. The report also mentioned that in 2022 through July, both the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index and MSCI Europe High Dividend Index delivered positive returns, versus a 13% decline in the S&amp;P 500.The significance of dividend stocks is evident from their contribution to overall market returns over the years. Moreover, reinvesting dividends can also boost shareholders’ investments over time. According to a report by T. Rowe Price Group, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970. The report also explored other markets as well and revealed that dividends represented over 46% of the market’s total returns in Europe since 1999.Story continuesConsidering the strong performance of dividend equities over the years, analysts also recommend loading up on these stocks, especially when inflation is high. Ramona Persaud, manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, gave her views on dividend investing to the financial services company in March. She said:""I really like dividend stocks in this environment, since these are typically companies that have pricing power that can offer inflation protection and the ability to sustain dividends.""She further mentioned that while investing in dividend stocks, the main focus should be on the respective company’s financial strength and its ability to maintain and grow its dividends. Some of these companies include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).With this context in mind, we will discuss extreme dividend stocks with upside potential in this article.11 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potentialeverything possible/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology:We selected companies that have been paying regular dividends to shareholders and have yields above 6%, as of March 21.

712,87b31473-a246-3f14-bdb7-43c59abb1d32,KO,2023-03-23,Why The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coca-cola-company-nyse-120033274.html,1679486433,STORY,['KO'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:37% = US$9.6b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.37.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Coca-Cola has a better ROE than the average (15%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola's Debt And Its 37% Return On EquityCoca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.58. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends consecutively for 25 years or more. These stocks are popular among investors because they can generate stable and regular income for them, which tends to grow over time. In addition to this, these securities provide protection during market downturns. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022. The report also mentioned that during the 15 worst-performing months for the S&amp;P 1500 during the same period, the high-yield index fell by 7.29%, compared with a 9.58% decline in the S&amp;P Composite 1500.When investing in dividend growers, investors look beyond yield and focus on other factors, including value, cash flow, and other business fundamentals. Companies that have proven records of dividend growth remain committed to their shareholder obligation and signal that they have the ability to raise their dividends in the long term. Washington Crossing Advisors referred to data by Ned Davis Research and revealed that dividend growers delivered a higher return with lower volatility when compared with ordinary dividend payers, non-dividend companies, and dividend cutters. The report mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014 with a 15.9% annual risk. In comparison, dividend cutters returned 3.4% during this period with an annual risk of 25.1%.Dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance during inflationary periods. The same report highlighted that companies with solid dividend growth returned 6.5% from 1972 to 2014 when inflation was above 4%, compared with a negative 7.9% return of the dividend cutters.Story continuesThe arguments discussed above show that investing in quality companies with strong cash flow can protect investors from market downturns. Mike Morey, the chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, spoke to Business Insider about his winning strategy to invest in companies with solid cash generation. Here are some comments from the fund manager:""We don't have to worry about what the Fed is doing; we don't have to worry about the economic cycle. Just simply by focusing on quality companies with strong free cash flows is going to get you through any economic cycle. And looking at performance over a full cycle, we're confident we can deliver superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis.""He also recommended buying stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) because of their growth and strong balance sheets.Considering these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend aristocrat stocks in this article.14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 14 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022.

In 2022, the company took its dividend growth streak to 45 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.42%, as of March 20. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 with a Hold rating on the shares, following the company's recent quarterly earnings. The firm also expects the company to report strong fiscal 2024 guidance.At the end of Q4 2022, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) was a part of 58 hedge fund portfolios, up from 55 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's data.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced disappointing clinical trial results for a new product in its pipeline and lowered its fiscal 2023 financial guidance due to lingering supply chain issues and slower than expected medical procedure recovery.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock in March and mentioned that the company's tax litigation risk is 'well discounted'. The firm also noted that the company could see resilient consumption this year.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as recorded on March 20.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s cash position remained strong in FY22.

Overall, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, worth $28.8 billion collectively.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American medical device and healthcare company that provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. Recently, the company announced the FDA approval for its blood-based laboratory test for traumatic brain injury. This lab test will give results in 18 minutes and is the first commercially available laboratory test in the US.On February 17, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based renewable energy company that mainly specializes in energy infrastructure.

NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

We saw mixed results from this group in the fourth quarter, with paint and coatings maker The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) benefiting from significant pricing power that will allow it to grow earnings handsomely with only modest revenue increases.""8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American retail corporation that owns grocery stores and department stores.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Fundsmith LLP was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure.

The Biologics License Application (BLA) for Zynyz for this indication has been approved under accelerated approval by the U.S. FDA based on tumor response rate and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval of Zynyz for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.MCC is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that frequently appears as a single, painless, reddish-purple skin nodule on the head, neck and arms in skin exposed to sunlight1. MCC tends to grow quickly and has a high rate of metastatic disease, leading to a poor prognosis2,3. The estimated five-year overall survival (OS) rate is 14% in patients with MCC who present with distant metastatic disease3. MCC impacts less than 1 per 100,000 people in the U.S., but incidence rates are rapidly rising, especially in adults over the age of 654,5.""More than a third of patients with MCC present with regional or distant metastases, which are associated with high rates of mortality,"" said Dr. Shailender Bhatia, University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. ""The approval of Zynyz offers healthcare providers another first-line treatment option against MCC that can result in durable responses in patients with metastatic disease, and I look forward to having Zynyz in our treatment portfolio for these difficult-to-treat patients.""Story continuesThe FDA approval was based on data from the POD1UM-201 trial, an open-label, multiregional, single-arm study that evaluated Zynyz in adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease. Among chemotherapy-naïve patients (n=65), Zynyz monotherapy resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 52% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40-65) as determined by independent central review (ICR) using RECIST v1.1. Complete response was seen in 12 patients (18%), and 22 patients (34%) showed partial response. Among the responding patients, the duration of response (DOR) ranged from 1.1 to 24.9+ months, and 76% (26/34) experienced a DOR of six months or longer, and 62% (21/34) experienced a DOR of 12 months or longer by landmark analysis.Serious adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients receiving Zynyz. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% of patients) were fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumonitis. Permanent discontinuation of Zynyz due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients. The most common (≥10%) adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Zynyz were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, rash, pyrexia and nausea.""Zynyz offers patients and healthcare professionals an additional first-line anti-PD-1 option for patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC, which can be a challenging and aggressive disease to treat,"" said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. ""Incyte is grateful to the investigators and patients around the world who participated in the POD1UM-201 trial. We continue to study the potential of Zynyz in additional tumor types and in combination with other Incyte pipeline compounds.""Incyte is committed to supporting patients and removing barriers to access medicines. Eligible patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Zynyz have access to IncyteCARES (Connecting to Access, Reimbursement, Education and Support), a comprehensive program offering personalized patient support, including financial assistance and ongoing education and additional resources.

Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks for the first year of therapy and 12 weeks thereafter.The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as determined by independent central radiographic review using RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); safety and pharmacokinetics.For more information about the study, please visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03599713.About Zynyz™ (retifanlimab-dlwr)Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), is an intravenous PD-1 inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

Among these, 168 patients were treated as part of the 24-week placebo-controlled period.The primary endpoint is the percentage change from baseline in the total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at week 24. The key secondary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving T-VASI50 (≥50% reduction from baseline in the T-VASI) at week 24. Results from the study showed that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body repigmentation in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, as measured by total T-VASI scores. The investigational therapy was well tolerated and the study met its primary endpoint.Povorcitinib (INCB54707) is an oral small-molecule JAK1 inhibitor. The candidate is currently in phase II studies for vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and prurigo nodularis. Phase III studies in HS are also ongoing.Shares of Incyte have lost 3.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Incyte also announced new 104-week results from the phase III TRuE-V clinical trial program evaluating Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream 1.5% in patients 12 years of age and older with nonsegmental vitiligo. Patients achieving a high level of facial repigmentation at week 52 maintained a durable response a year following the withdrawal of treatment. The continued treatment with Opzelura for up to two years resulted in sustained facial repigmentation and further improvements in facial and total body repigmentation.Story continuesOpzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older.The successful development of other drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

725,9edff6ee-0889-3c72-92a6-d048367ef95f,INTU,2023-03-23,How Intuit is reskilling talent to win big on its $20 billion A.I. bet,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-reskilling-talent-win-big-100000835.html,1679306400,STORY,['INTU'],"[Many companies have only just begun to think about talent redistribution—call it doing more with less. But for Intuit, moving talent around is part of its DNA. The financial software company known for products like QuickBooks and TurboTax has long retrained white-collar workers to fill talent gaps and remain competitive as a result, moving employees into new roles that suit its shifting goals as an innovator in financial technology.“At every major inflection point, there has to be an evolution,” says Humera Shahid, chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer and head of talent development at Intuit. Its current inflection point: transforming into a fully A.I.-driven software company.“That means the way that we’re organized is different, [and] the skill sets that we need are rapidly changing, especially in technology,” Shahid says.Intuit has undergone many iterations since its inception in 1983 as a digital checkbook to help people pay bills, later known as Quicken. Over the past four decades, the $13 billion software firm has repeatedly reinvented itself, notably selling Quicken in 2016, then pivoting from operating solely as a tax and accounting platform to a more holistic financial platform for individuals and small businesses. It recently made two big acquisitions in Credit Karma ($8.1 billion) and MailChimp ($12 billion) as part of its data play. Each of these versions has required new skills and training for employees in functions that are in decline or no longer a priority.Now, Intuit’s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, who joined the company in January 2019, is running the ball squarely into its A.I. future and doubling down on reskilling workers as the company navigates a tight labor market, a shortage of talent with the necessary skills, and financial constraints brought on by the broader economic climate.In June 2020, Intuit laid off over 715 employees, simultaneously announcing it would add over 700 roles to align with its goal to become an A.I.-driven company.Story continuesCompanies that want to become technologically innovative, says Shahid, must invest in training their employees: “You can’t buy your way there.” Intuit declined to share how much it invested in employee training over the past three years, but Shahid says her team has committed resources to build a learning culture where employees can seamlessly transition to new roles and assignments. “I have someone on my team who came in as an executive assistant and is now interested in going down a more technical path,” she shares.Exposure comes in the form of introductory programming open to any employee interested in learning about A.I. The company led a three-part series of lunch-and-learn sessions with its SVP and chief data officer, Ashok Srivastava, in August 2020. About 120 employees attended the introductory courses, which Intuit eventually transitioned to a five-part online course.And when online courses aren’t enough, the company employs partners to lead in-person boot camps. While pricey, Shahid says creating and scaling a similar learning infrastructure in-house is far more difficult.“What we’re pushing right now is to expose [employees] to all these skills. You might be a data analyst and know what’s needed of you. But we also want you to know what it takes to be a program manager,” Shahid says. She wants as well for employees to get a sense of which skills are transferable.Across the tech space, A.I. has emerged as a top priority for growth. It’s no different at Intuit, which has developed intensive programs to upskill employees for technical roles like its signature six-month A.I. course.The company began offering a seven-month apprenticeship program for nontechnical employees last year, which has proved especially popular among data analysts and project managers who want to transition into engineering roles and obtain hands-on experience, says Shahid. Employees graduate as level one software engineers. Eleven employees participated in the pilot apprenticeship program; nine have converted to full-time technical roles at the firm.It’s a sign of mobility that company leaders are eager to promote. The second iteration of the apprenticeship program will accept 43 participants—30 of whom will be based at Intuit’s Mountain View, Calif., campus and 13 in San Diego.Intuit’s chief data officer says that while employees must have the right credentials to move into more tech-heavy roles, he firmly believes in people’s ability to reinvent themselves and reskill. “Given the opportunity, I think that people have remarkable abilities to grow and to change,” Srivastava notes. “Having said that, not everyone wants to go into the deep mathematics of machine learning, and I appreciate that.”The transition from nontechnical to technical roles in particular ostensibly comes with challenges. Driving awareness of the courses and getting staff to sign on has proved much harder among employees without some technical background who might be slightly intimidated or unsure about future use cases for these new skills. And even after employees gain the necessary learning and credentials, additional tensions can naturally arise when team members have varying experience levels.“You’ve got apprentices who are software engineers, ones with no technical background, and others who literally did four-year degrees in computer science. And they’re side by side,” Shahid says. “You have to keep thinking about that equity equation. What are you doing to support folks you brought in, [and] how do you continue that support system?”That support system is essential for marginalized employees moving into new technical roles, who often don’t have large networks within the industry. Because of this, Srivastava says creating a sense of belonging on technical teams is key.“Regardless of where the person’s background is, and what we view as a traditional or nontraditional background, what’s important is that in the context of that background, we create a sense of belonging and participation,” he says.Meeting Intuit’s goal to reskill workers for an A.I. future hinges on its ability to create a culture of learning and mobility. “Our big focus is, How do you combine those two things?” Shahid muses.Check out this global study on cultural fitness by HR research firm i4cp, in partnership with Fortune.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Some stocks provide a combination of these factors, such as the Dividend Champions — stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 25 years in a row.These companies have proven that they can manage through recessions while continuing to pay dividends each year and raise their dividends on an annual basis.These three Dividend Champions have long histories of dividend growth, market-beating yields and the ability to raise their dividends each year going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend Champion: Stryker (SYK)The Stryker (SYK) office in Fremont, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comStryker (NYSE:SYK) is a global leader in the medical device sector. The company’s product lines include surgical equipment, neurovascular products and orthopedic implants.The company has continued to generate growth in 2023, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. On Jan. 31, 2023, Stryker reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results for the period ending Dec. 31, 2022. For the quarter, revenue grew 10.6% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates by $230 million. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3, which compared to $2.71 in the prior year and was 16 cents above expectations.For 2022, revenue grew 7.8% to $18.4 billion while adjusted EPS of $9.34 was up slightly from $9.09 in the prior year. Organic revenue was 13.2% for the quarter and 9.7% for the year. For the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic growth of 16.9%, while Orthopaedics and Spine grew 8.4%. Results for both businesses were driven by strong demand in volume even as the company had slightly lower realized prices.Stryker guided for 2023 as well. The company expects organic revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% for the year. Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in a range of $9.85 to $10.15, which would represent growth of 7.1% at the midpoint.Stryker has increased its dividend at an average rate of almost 12% per year over the past 10 years. The company has now increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years.

It is cross-listed in Toronto and New York. At the end of 2022, Fortis had 99% regulated assets: 82% regulated electric and 17% regulated gas. As well, 64% were in the U.S., 33% in Canada and 3% in the Caribbean.Fortis has increased its dividend for 49 consecutive years, and the stock currently yields 4.3%.Fortis reported Q4 2022 results on Feb. 10, 2023. For the quarter, it reported adjusted net earnings up 16% versus Q4 2022, while adjusted EPS rose 14%. The full-year 2022 results provide a bigger picture. Adjusted earnings rose 9% year over year (YOY), while adjusted EPS increased by 7%. For 2023, it plans capital investments of C$4.3 billion. We initiate our 2023 EPS estimate at $2.20.After releasing its five-year capital plan of C$22.3 billion for 2023 to 2027, which suggests a mid-year rate base growth at a compound annual growth rate of ~6.2% from C$34.0 billion in 2022 to C$46.1 billion in 2027, the company also revealed its dividend growth guidance of 4-6% through 2027.Because demand for Fortis’ utility services doesn’t change much in various economic environments, Fortis’s results have been quite resilient through economic uncertainties, including the one we’re experiencing in which inflation and interest rates are higher than in recent history. Fortis’ liquidity position is strong, including C$3.8 billion of undrawn liquidity available from $5.9 billion credit facilities at the end of Q4 2022.Fortis’ payout ratio had been about 70% of earnings, which is where it’s heading. The dividend is important to management, and we believe it is safe and should continue to rise for years to come. Fortis’ competitive advantage is its size and scale.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy. If inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, consumers may have to significantly reduce their spending on non-essential items, which would negatively impact the earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector, such as clothing retailers, luxury brands, and travel firms. However, if inflation eases and the Federal Reserve successfully manages a gentle economic slowdown, these stocks could potentially lead a rebound in the markets. The consumer discretionary sector has already been heavily discounted due to the prevailing pessimism, which could create attractive investment prospects.The performance of different sectors in 2023 is expected to be heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. Investors may react positively to a decrease in inflation and the end of the Fed's rate-hike cycle, but the opposite could prolong uncertainty. The supply and demand balance will also be significant, as frequent price promotions may have a detrimental impact on retailers' profit margins. Nevertheless, consumers with higher incomes, who have more savings and spend a lower proportion of their income on basic living expenses like utilities, may continue to have strong discretionary spending. Some of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy include Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Despite reports of job cuts in the news, overall employment is still increasing. Although the number of people filing for unemployment benefits remains low, the effects of the layoffs will eventually become evident, resulting in a decline in total wages and salaries paid. Nevertheless, the impact of this downturn will be postponed due to past savings. In 2020 and 2021, the majority of the stimulus checks were saved, and higher-than-normal savings rates were also due to more generous unemployment insurance payouts and rising wage rates. Despite some uncertainty as the year progresses, the larger economic trends suggest a positive outlook for consumer spending in 2023. However, by 2024, consumers will have depleted their current earnings and savings, resulting in a significant decrease in discretionary spending. Businesses that sell to consumers should not prematurely reduce their inventory levels. Maintaining sufficient inventory is essential to capitalize on available sales opportunities. Story continuesOur Methodology For this article, we selected consumer discretionary stocks such as furniture companies, travel firms, home appliances providers, fitness-related firms, casinos, and restaurants based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To BuywithGod/Shutterstock.comBest Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy13. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) manufactures and sells home appliances in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The primary items manufactured by the company include fridges, freezers, ice machines, commercial laundry products, and dishwashers along with their accompanying accessories.

Credit Suisse has revised its estimates for 2023 and 2024 to $15.30 and $16.30, respectively, after the firm's initial note on the company's Q4 results. The 2023 estimate is slightly lower than management's guidance due to Credit Suisse's more conservative outlook on housing turnover, which is a major factor in appliance sales, through 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), with collective stakes worth $842.7 million. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.70 million shares worth $383.15 million. Like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. 12. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) franchises and operates fitness centers under the Planet Fitness brand. The company has three divisions – Franchise, Corporate-Owned Stores, and Equipment. It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 23, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 and a revenue of $281.3 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $9.82 million, respectively. In 2023, the company expects revenue to increase by 13% to 14% as compared to 2022, and earnings per share to increase by 33% to 36%. On February 27, Max Rakhlenko, an analyst at Cowen, increased the company's price target on Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) from $90 to $92 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst noted that the company ended Q4 with positive momentum, and he anticipates robust growth in member numbers for Q1.

(NYSE:PLNT), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Karthik Sarma’s SRS Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 7 million shares worth $548 million. Baron Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), the leading franchiser and operator of low-cost fitness centers, rose after reporting strong results. The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”11. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) operates as a play and entertainment company in the United States and internationally. The company's business is divided into three segments – Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, and Entertainment. On February 13, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.70 paper share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 15, to shareholders of record on May 1. The fourth quarter revenue of $1.68 billion exceeded Wall Street estimates by $10 million. It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in. On February 17, DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser maintained a Buy recommendation on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $80 from $95. In a research note to investors, the analyst stated that after announcing a Q4 shortfall, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)’s full-quarter report and 2023 guidance were significantly below expectations. Nonetheless, Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has several top-line drivers in 2023, including toys for six blockbuster movies.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $70 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Rising inflation pressuring consumer budgets for discretionary purchases, as well as volatile currency markets, weighed on global entertainment company Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), which owns Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh and other games and brands.  The main detractors from absolute returns were positions in Microsoft, Ball, Intel, Hasbro and McCormick (MKC).”10. Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Next on our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks is Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), which operates as a gaming company in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It operates through three segments – Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas, and Midwest &amp; South. On February 14, Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) declared a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend, a 6.7% increase from its prior dividend of $0.15. The dividend is payable on April 15, to shareholders of record on March 15. On February 9, Susquehanna analyst Joseph Stauff raised the firm's price target on Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) to $80 from $72 and reiterated a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst lifted his target to reflect his higher estimates as the company's outlook provides downside protection.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), compared to 36 funds in the prior quarter. John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.45 million shares worth $188.50 million. Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of U.S. regional casino operator Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), increased in the fourth quarter due to stable consumer visitation and spending levels despite an uncertain macro environment. The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel. We continue to be positive on the company’s long-term prospects.”9. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. It provides burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, tacos, and salads. The company was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, California. It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to monitor. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)’s in-restaurant sales increased 17.5%, while digital sales represented 37.4% of food and beverage revenue. According to Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) has faced challenges in maintaining margins due to inflation in industry commodity and labor costs, resulting in the highest level of pricing in four decades. The company has predicted that it will achieve 27% restaurant margins with $3 million sales volumes, a target that both Cowen and consensus forecasts anticipate will be reached in 2024. Despite this, the analyst maintained its Outperform rating and $2040 price target for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shares on February 13. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 45 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square held the largest stake in the company, comprising 1.10 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We added to our position in made-to-order burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Despite restaurants typically being seen as more sensitive to an economic downturn, the company has consistently been able to exceed expectations through its ability to pass through inflationary increases in both materials and labor through strong pricing power. Chipotle’s investments in digital technology have enabled it to leverage the higher margin delivery business, highlighted by the implementation of “Chipotlanes”, a digital drive through option in suburban areas where customers pay in advance online, to drive significant increases in restaurant volumes.”8. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) owns and manages casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts in the United States and Macau.

It is one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to consider. On February 24, Barclays analyst Brandt Montour initiated coverage of MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) with an Overweight rating and a $59 price target. The analyst stated that MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is a premium diversified global gaming operator with an attractive valuation, and has multiple opportunities to succeed, such as the strength of Las Vegas, the recovery of Macau, the company's new project pipeline, and its near-term elevated share repurchases. The analyst also believes that MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) has an attractive premium positioning in Las Vegas and in the U.S. regional market.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Keith Meister’s Corvex Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 6.6 million shares worth $223.7 million. Baron Funds made the following comment about MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is a leading global casino and entertainment company with 29 unique hotels and casinos including some of the most recognizable resort brands such as Bellagio, MGM Grand, ARIA, and Park MGM. At its recent price of only $30 per share, we believe MGM’s valuation is compelling at only 6 times 2023 estimated cash flow.”7. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that allows hosts to provide accommodations and experiences to guests worldwide. Through a marketplace model, the company connects hosts and guests via online or mobile devices to book stays and experiences. Airbnb, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $144 price target. The analyst believes that the demand for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) rentals will remain robust due to the trend of longer stays and expansion in urban markets. Additionally, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, growth in Latin America, and early bookings for summer vacations in Europe are expected to benefit Airbnb. Argus has also revised its earnings per share estimates for FY23 and FY24 to $3.60 and $4.00, respectively, up from $3.00 and $3.60.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.85 million shares worth $244.5 million. Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world’s largest, well-known and fastest growing provider of short-term rental properties via a simple and intuitive online platform. The company has been benefiting from a strong recovery in travel demand so far this year, but shares have been weaker alongside growth stocks in general. Recent results showed nearly 100 million nights booked, up 25% YoY, gross booking value growth of 31% and revenue growth of 29%. We believe Airbnb will continue to generate attractive top-line growth that will outpace that of overall travel. From a demand perspective, we expect the company to continue to maintain its leadership in long-term stays and benefit from a recovery in urban, cross-border and APAC re-opening. The company has rolled out products to improve its value proposition to travelers and hosts, including “Smart Pricing” to ensure its supply continues to provide relative value to consumers, “Aircover for Hosts” to increase supply and “Categories” to better match consumer demand to available supply. Given these profit cycle tailwinds and shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we remain invested.”6. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) and its subsidiaries are responsible for creating, owning, and managing all-inclusive resorts in Singapore and Macau. These resorts offer various services including lodging, gambling, entertainment, shopping centers, convention centers, celebrity chef restaurants, and other amenities. On March 13, Jefferies analyst David Katz increased the firm's price target on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) to $66 from $64 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. After conducting property tours and meeting with management in Macau and Singapore, the firm has expressed greater confidence in the recovery and capital spending for Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). As a result, Jefferies has raised its valuation multiple to reflect the accelerating trends in Macau and higher estimates for Marina Bay Sands. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with  2.05 million shares worth $98.7 million. In addition to Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) is one of the top consumer discretionary stocks to watch. ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), in the consumer discretionary sector, which owns and operates several high-profile resorts and casinos in Macau and Singapore. One of the highest probability macro events we anticipate in 2023 is a China reopening, with forecasts (and the Chinese government itself) targeting over 5% growth. A big driver of this growth will be the massive pent-up demand for travel and entertainment after almost three years of being locked down and accumulating a mountain of private savings. We felt that Las Vegas Sands was an attractively-valued opportunity to capture the Chinese reopening, and specifically an eventual rebound in Macau from historically depressed levels. Las Vegas Sands is yet another example of a name supported by strong earnings growth that should generate positive performance, regardless of recession potential, due to the downside protection afforded by its solid free cash flow generation from already reopened destinations in Singapore. When combined with the material upside as earnings and cash flow gap up on a Macau reopening, we believe the risk/reward tradeoff is heavily underappreciated from the market and were able to capitalize and enter the stock at an extremely compelling entry point.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks Disclosure: None. 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Secure your seat todayImmersion cooling technology firm LiquidStack secured a Series B funding round of undisclosed amount from Trane Technologies (TT), the company said Wednesday.The fresh capital will be used primarily to scale up manufacturing – with the startup aiming to announce a U.S. facility in the third quarter – research and development to expand the offerings, and commercial operations, said CEO Joe Capes in a press release. Currently the company's manufacturing operations are in Germany.LiquidStack specializes in two-phase immersion cooling, in which computers are submerged in dielectric heat transfer liquid, as opposed to mineral oils used in other models. This type of liquid is more environmentally friendly to produce and less resource intensive than air cooling, currently the most common practice among bitcoin miners.LiquidStack's two phase immersion cooling can reduce the energy and water footprint of crypto mines. (LiquidStack)The two-phase system can reduce a data center's carbon footprint by over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per megawatt (MW). Data centers will also see a 40% reduction in the energy use of mechanical equipment, 33% lower capital expenditure and 32% less land use, the firm said. ""A broader adoption of LiquidStack’s technology can also reduce water usage for powering and cooling data centers by over 300 billion liters per year,"" according to the press release.Spending less on energy is a crucial selling point for bitcoin miners, whose biggest operational cost is electricity. Capes told CoinDesk that for every megawatt (MW) of energy used for the actual computing, LiquidStack's solution uses 0.02 MW for cooling, whereas other options use 0.1 MW to 0.7 MW.The Marlborough, Massachusetts, company started out in the early days of bitcoin mining in Hong Kong, before being merged into German miner Bitfury in 2015 and then going off on its own again in 2021. ""We were the first company in the world to not only deploy immersion cooling for mining, but to also do it at massive scale,"" Capes told CoinDesk, referring to two Bitfury sites in Central Asia.Story continuesLater, during the crypto bear market of 2019, LiquidStack pivoted away from mining ""because we didn't want LiquidStack to be tied directly to the price of bitcoin,"" Capes said. The company worked with Dell and Microsoft in those years, he added.Today, however, the company's pipeline of crypto is larger than traditional data centers or edge computing sites, said the CEO. While technically the firm has more clients in the non-mining segments, those are smaller contracts, Capes said.Still, at $7.2 million per MW of infrastructure, the LiquidStack solution is not cheap.""What we're finding in our [crypto mining] industry is that you you either pay now, or you pay later,"" said Capes, making the argument that the miners who don't spend enough to bring their operating expenses down, later find themselves unprofitable.Trane Technologies is a heating and cooling tech firm that's been around for roughly 150 years. The company had $16 billion in revenues in 2022.LiquidStack’s technology ""is raising the bar for sustainable data center cooling,"" said Amber Mulligan, Trane's vice president of strategic sales and marketing, commercial heating, ventilation and cooling for Americas, told CoinDesk. The company will help Trane achieve its sustainability commitments, she continued, among them ""reducing one billion metric tons of carbon emissions from our customers’ footprint by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.""]"

The project is estimated to cost $13 billion.ConocoPhillips acquired a 30% stake in the first phase of the Port Arthur project. The company will purchase 5 million tons per annum of LNG from Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur Phase 1 project in Jefferson County for 20 years. COP will enjoy specific equity and offtake rights to engage in future expansion projects at Port Arthur LNG.Oil and gas producers aim to drive domestic LNG supply and exports as western sanctions on Russia have hindered an already undersupplied market and put U.S. gas prices into a higher gear. ConocoPhillips’ participation in the Port Arthur project will provide a reliable supply of natural gas and enhance its portfolio.Sempra Energy is advancing the global energy transition through electrification and decarbonization in the markets it serves, including California, Texas, Mexico and the LNG export market. Sempra Energy has also agreed to divest an indirect stake in the project to KKR &amp; Co Inc.Per the deal, an infrastructure fund managed by KKR will acquire a 25-49% indirect, non-controlling interest in the project. Sempra’s unit, Sempra Infrastructure Partners, will target 20-30% of indirect ownership interest in the project, subject to the closing of the KKR sale.With strong customers and premier equity sponsors like ConocoPhillips, Port Arthur LNG can become one of America’s major energy infrastructure investments over the years.

Last year, SoCalGas collaborated with 578 diverse businesses in support of the company's operations and mission to build the cleanest, safest, most innovative energy company in America. SoCalGas' full 2022 supplier diversity report, entitled Supporting a Sustainable Future in Clean Energy Through Diversity, Innovation and Collaboration, was filed with the CPUC earlier this month.""For 30 straight years we have exceeded the CPUC's diversity procurement goals, mainly through collaborations with hundreds of local businesses from Los Angeles, to the Central Valley, to the Inland Empire, helping to bolster the economies in the communities we serve,"" said SoCalGas Chief Executive Officer Scott Drury. ""This milestone is a great example of how SoCalGas' commitments to equity, inclusion, and sustainability extend into the hundreds of California communities we're proud to serve.""SoCalGas' ASPIRE 2045 sustainability strategy, includes an even bolder goal to achieve 45% spending with diverse business enterprises by 2025. Through a robust portfolio of programs, SoCalGas is working to increase diverse business participation especially among African American, Native American, LGBT, and veteran businesses—categories in which certified DBEs are historically underrepresented.Last year SoCalGas expanded outreach to hundreds of businesses, offering enhanced technical assistance and other programs to provide a bridge to business opportunities with SoCalGas today and in the future. As a result, 146 diverse businesses began working with SoCalGas for the first time in 2022. Additionally, 15 of SoCalGas' top 25 suppliers last year were diverse vendors, up from 13 in 2021.Story continuesOver the last six years, SoCalGas spent nearly $5 billion with diverse business enterprises. In addition, many companies have benefitted from business development programs and services offered by SoCalGas' supplier diversity team.""Our journey began when we were enrolled in SoCalGas' Smaller Contractor Opportunity Realization Effort (SCORE) program in 2013,"" says Bianca Vobecky, president &amp; CEO of Vobecky Enterprises Inc., an African American-owned firm that provides logistics services to SoCalGas. ""The knowledge and training we received from this program helped expand our business and diversification into other areas like material procurement and project management. Working on SoCalGas projects, and with the supplier diversity team's unwavering advocacy, we've received more opportunities."" Vobecky recently received a contract with SoCalGas in support of a fleet safety retrofit program.""SoCalGas continues to bring in new diverse suppliers, helping their growth, and contracting with nearly 90% of diverse businesses that are headquartered in our state. They understand that keeping dollars in our local businesses creates a greater impact in our diverse communities,"" said Dennis Huang, Executive Director and CEO, Asian Business Association, Los Angeles.""Thanks to our 36-year partnership with SoCalGas, we have been able to scale the business, employ more people, and develop a program that brings on diverse suppliers as subcontractors,"" said Henry Barber, president of Doty Brothers, a Hispanic-owned general engineering contractor. ""One of the benefits of such a long-standing relationship is that SoCalGas gets a consistent, quality product for their customer base. For Doty Brothers, it's helped us stay in business, remain profitable and provide good-paying jobs.""Last year, SoCalGas' Chief Executive Officer, Scott Drury, was named 2022 CEO Diversity Champion by the Southern California Minority Supplier Development Council (SCMSDC), which represents more than 1,500 certified minority-owned businesses. Drury was recognized by SCMSDC for embodying ""the leadership needed to advance diversity and inclusion in contracting,"" and for featuring supplier diversity as a focus of SoCalGas' ASPIRE 2045 sustainability strategy.

Additionally, Sempra Infrastructure announced the closing of the project's $6.8 billion non-recourse debt financing and the issuance of the final notice to proceed under the project's engineering, procurement and construction agreement.Sempra Launches Port Arthur LNG Project""At Sempra, we believe bold, forward-looking partnerships will be central to solving the world's energy security and decarbonization challenges,"" said Jeffrey W. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra. ""With strong customers, top-tier equity sponsors in ConocoPhillips and KKR and a world class contractor in Bechtel, this project has the potential to become one of America's most significant energy infrastructure investments over time, while creating jobs and spurring continued economic growth across Texas and the Gulf Coast region.""""Sempra's selection of Port Arthur as the location for a new natural gas liquefication and export terminal is a strategic decision that will cement Texas' position as the energy capital of the world,"" said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""With a highly skilled workforce and business-friendly climate, and as a national leader in LNG exports, Texas is the prime location to expand LNG operations to unleash the United States' full economic potential in such a critical industry. Expanding LNG is imperative to American energy security, and the State of Texas looks forward to working alongside Sempra to advance this mission and bring more jobs and greater opportunities to hardworking Texans.""Story continuesThe Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is fully permitted and is designed to include two natural gas liquefaction trains, two liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks and associated facilities with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa). Total capital expenditures for the Port Arthur Phase 1 project are estimated at $13 billion.The long-term contractable capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa is fully subscribed under binding long-term agreements with strong counterparties —ConocoPhillips, RWE Supply and Trading, PKN ORLEN S.A., INEOS and ENGIE S.A., all of which became effective upon reaching FID. Sempra Infrastructure is also actively marketing and developing the competitively positioned Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project, which is expected to have similar offtake capacity to Phase 1.World-Class PartnershipsSempra and ConocoPhillips closed their joint venture whereby an affiliate of ConocoPhillips has acquired a 30% non-controlling interest in the project, is purchasing 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the project under a 20-year sale and purchase agreement and is managing the project's overall natural gas supply requirements. ConocoPhillips will also have certain rights to participate in future expansion projects in both equity and offtake.""Our strategic LNG partnership with Sempra will help supply growing global demand for natural gas, a lower greenhouse gas emissions-intensity fuel expected to play a critical role in the energy transition and global energy mix going forward,"" said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer. ""ConocoPhillips has more than 60 years of experience with LNG, and we look forward to continuing to build our LNG portfolio and expanding our role in delivering a lower-carbon future that strengthens U.S. and global energy security.""Sempra Infrastructure announced an agreement whereby KKR will acquire a 25% to 49% indirect, non-controlling interest in the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project. Pursuant to the agreement with KKR, Sempra Infrastructure will retain certain economic and other rights with respect to the interest being transferred while granting KKR certain minority interest protections. KKR is making the investment primarily through its Global Infrastructure Investors IV fund.""We are pleased to invest in this critical energy infrastructure project and extend our strategic partnership with Sempra and their world-class team,"" said James Cunningham, Partner at KKR. ""Phase 1 will create new jobs, support American economic growth and deliver reliable and cleaner energy during the global energy transition. Consistent with KKR Infrastructure's strategy of seeking stable and predictable returns for investors, our investment in Phase 1 is backed by robust cash flows through long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties.""Sempra Infrastructure is targeting 20% to 30% of indirect ownership interest in the project, subject to the closing of the KKR sale. For illustrative purposes, if Sempra Infrastructure's indirect ownership interest is at the midpoint of the referenced range, or 25%, Sempra Infrastructure would expect its share of average adjusted EBITDA after full commercial operations to be approximately $410 million annually and its equity commitment to be approximately $1.55 billion. Sempra's share of the above estimates would be equal to 70% of these amounts. The foregoing estimates exclude other potentially significant economic benefits associated with, among other items, the development of future phases and further optimization of the project.Sempra Infrastructure has contracted with global engineering, construction and project management firm Bechtel Energy Inc. and has issued a final notice to proceed for the project. The expected commercial operation dates for Train 1 and Train 2 are 2027 and 2028, respectively.""We're proud to partner with Sempra to deliver a world-class LNG facility. Building from mature, scalable energy technologies helps safeguard our energy supplies and promote the transition to lower-carbon energy,"" said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel. ""Bechtel has a record of delivering LNG infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast and bringing quality jobs and training opportunities to local communities. The 5,000 construction jobs this project creates will provide outstanding opportunities for craft professionals — growing a skilled workforce that will benefit the region for years to come.""Local BenefitsSempra Infrastructure believes that building strong relationships and supporting the communities where its employees live and work is fundamental to how it does business. Moreover, the company focuses its community development initiatives on local priorities including education and leadership development, environmental stewardship and safety.Since 2015, Port Arthur LNG has invested more than $40 million to support Jefferson County communities, including working with local vendors to procure materials and services for the relocation of a 3.5-mile portion of Highway 87 and on grants to more than 60 local non-profits, schools and business development groups.The Phase 1 project is another significant opportunity to expand Sempra Infrastructure's economic impact. The project is expected to create an estimated 5,000 highly skilled jobs during construction and boost the economies in Port Arthur and Jefferson County.""Sempra has long been an economic driver for Jefferson County here in Southeast Texas, and this new Port Arthur LNG facility will continue that trend by bringing thousands of jobs, new markets for natural gas and more energy security for our nation,"" Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives Dade Phelan said. ""Texas House District 21 is proud of this latest development that showcases our great state's leadership in economic development, job creation and energy production.""The successful completion of the KKR sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and the completion of construction of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE:LYB) share price down 13% in the last month. But in three years the returns have been great. The share price marched upwards over that time, and is now 109% higher than it was. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.LyondellBasell Industries was able to grow its EPS at 7.4% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of LyondellBasell Industries, it has a TSR of 153% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 11% received by LyondellBasell Industries shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -12%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand LyondellBasell Industries better, we need to consider many other factors.

736,cd225fe5-3fde-3022-9c63-7298265a62f9,VMC,2023-03-23,Statement on the Illegal Occupation of Vulcan's Property in Mexico,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/statement-illegal-occupation-vulcans-property-200400034.html,1679429040,STORY,"['VMC', 'CX', 'CXMSF']","[BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, today issued the following statement:On Tuesday, March 14, 2023, CEMEX (NYSE:CX), aided by armed Mexican police and military, forcibly entered Vulcan's port facilities near Playa del Carmen. They are still occupying the property.There is no contract permitting CEMEX's use of Vulcan's port facilities. Although the companies had an agreement for CEMEX to lease a portion of Vulcan's property, that agreement expired on December 31, 2022, without any renewal. Prior to the expiration, CEMEX was formally made aware that negotiation of a new contract would be necessary. Vulcan has been and remains open to renegotiating the lease agreement.Rather than looking for a mutually agreeable solution, CEMEX officers threatened to seek the aid of the Mexican government, including its armed forces, to use Vulcan's port facilities.On March 14 and to this day, CEMEX, the military and the police have not presented any court order, warrant or other legal justification for their forceful entry and occupation of Vulcan's property. Contrary to CEMEX's position, a Mexican federal court ordered CEMEX to vacate the property, and another Mexican federal court order requires military and police forces to leave the property immediately.The Mexican government continues its illegal shutdown of Vulcan's quarrying, processing and shipping operations. Nonetheless, Vulcan owns the four parcels of property that make up its Mexico operation, including the port facilities. Likewise, Vulcan lawfully holds the port concession. Use of Vulcan's private property by third parties, such as CEMEX, requires Vulcan's authorization.About Vulcan Materials CompanyVulcan Materials Company, a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index with headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama, is the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates – primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel – and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete.  For additional information about Vulcan, go to www.vulcanmaterials.com.Story continuesFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT DISCLAIMERThis document contains forward-looking statements.  Statements that are not historical fact, including statements about Vulcan's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements.  Generally, these statements relate to future financial performance, results of operations, business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated revenues, expenses, earnings (including EBITDA and other measures), dividend policy, shipment volumes, pricing, levels of capital expenditures, intended cost reductions and cost savings, anticipated profit improvements and/or planned divestitures and asset sales.  These forward-looking statements are sometimes identified by the use of terms and phrases such as ""believe,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""will,"" ""can,"" ""may"" or similar expressions elsewhere in this document.  These statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including but not limited to general business conditions, competitive factors, pricing, energy costs, and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports Vulcan periodically files with the SEC.Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results, developments, and business decisions may vary significantly from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.  The following risks related to Vulcan's business, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: general economic and business conditions;

These stocks are also Dividend Aristocrats, raising their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Aflac (AFL)Starting out is Aflac which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Aflac is in the finance sector but as an insurance provider, it should be able to avoid much of the scrutiny and uncertainty that banks are facing.Plus, Aflac’s Insurance-Accident and Health Industry is currently in the top 4% of over 250 Zacks Industries. To that point, earnings estimates revisions have continued to go up over the last 60 days. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now risen 4% throughout the quarter and FY24 EPS estimates are up 3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflac’s earnings are now forecasted to be up 5% this year and jump another 6% in FY24 at $5.96 per share. Sales are projected to dip -5% in FY23 but rebound and rise 1% in FY24 to $18.64 billion.Dividend History: AFL has a 2.60% annual dividend yield at $1.68 a share. The annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 10.76%. With a 30% payout ratio, Aflac has now raised its dividend for 39 consecutive years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of AFL are down -11% year to date, but this year’s drop may be a buying opportunity as Aflac stock is up a very stellar +148% over the last three years to easily top the S&amp;P 500 and match the Insurance-Accident &amp; Health Markets +147%.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking Aflac stock look more attractive at the moment is its price-to-earnings valuation. Shares of AFL trade at $63 per share and 11.5X forward earnings which is beneath the industry average of 12.6X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.4X. This is also below its decade high of 13.8X and not far above the median of 10.5X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCincinnati Financial (CINF)Another top-rated Zacks Finance sector stock that investors may want to consider is Cincinnati Financial. As a marketer of property and casualty insurance, Cincinnati Financial may also avoid much of the weakness associated with banks at the moment.Cincinnati Financial also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its Insurance-Property and Casualty Industry in the top 30% of all Zacks Industries.Earnings estimates have noticeably gone up throughout the quarter. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have jumped 13% and FY24 EPS estimates have climbed 19%.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCincinnati Financials earnings are now expected to leap 21% this year and jump another 15% in FY24 at $5.90 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 7% in FY23 and rise another 8% in FY24 to $9.34 billion.  Dividend History: CINF has a 2.70% annual dividend yield at $3 a share. Cincinnati Financials dividend growth over the last five years is 6.41% with a 65% payout ratio. Even better, Cincinnati Financial has raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years classifying it as a Dividend King as well (50 consecutive years).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCINF stock is up 5% YTD to slightly top the S&amp;P 500’s +4% and the Insurance-Property &amp; Casualty Markets -2%. Over the last three years, CINF’s +61% has slightly trailed the benchmark but roughly matched its Zacks Subindustry’s +66%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith that being said, Cincinnati Financial stock trades attractively relative to its past. At $107 per share, CINF trades at 21.6X forward earnings and above the industry average of 12.9X. However, CINF trades 31% below its decade-long high of 31.3X and at an 8% discount to the median of 23.5X with the rising earnings estimates offering further support to its P/E valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe rising earnings estimate revisions are a great sign for these Dividend Aristocrats along with their reliable dividends. This is also reassuring to investors who may have doubts about finding opportunities in the broader financial sector. In this regard, Aflac and Cincinnati Financial look like viable options and there could certainly be more upside in their stocks.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The insurer inked an accelerated share repurchase agreement with JP Morgan to buy back $200 million worth of the company’s shares.Post completion of the ASR, AEL will have about $276 million remaining under the share repurchase program.From the inception of the share repurchase program in 2020 through Dec 31, 2022, AEL bought back about 23.9 million shares. The insurer also bought back about 2.437 million shares year to date. In November 2022, AEL’s board approved a $400-million share buyback program in tandem with the AEL 2.0 strategy.American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company is a leader in the development and sale of fixed index and fixed rate annuity products. The execution of the AEL 2.0 strategy remains on track. AEL expects around one-third of the new business flow to convert into the return on asset business through growth in reinsured liabilities. Thus, the insurer believes its mix of fee revenues will support a higher-return business profile.Banking on operational strength, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer engages in effective capital deployment.  Apart from share buyback, AEL has hiked dividends each year since 2003, when it went public. Its dividend increased at a 20-year CAGR (2003-2022) of 19.6%.Shares of AEL have lost 23% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 2.4%. Focus on expansion into new verticals, the increasing popularity of index products in the market, solid balance sheet and effective capital deployment should help AEL bounce back.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven a solid capital level in the insurance industry and an improving operating backdrop favoring strong operational performance, insurers like Horace Mann Educators Corporation HMN, Chubb Limited CB and Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF have resorted to effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value.Horace Mann’s board of directors approved a 3.1% hike in its quarterly dividend, marking marks the 15th consecutive yearly hike. Strategic focus on designing products to capitalize on the potential opportunity in the K-12 educator market, annuity reinsurance agreement, profitable in-force block, high quality and well-diversified investment portfolio, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to help Horace Mann increase dividends. HMN targets a 50% dividend payout ratio.Chubb’s board looks to increase its annual dividend by 3.6%. Chubb’s dividends have witnessed an eight-year CAGR (2022-2023) of 2.4%. Its dividend yield of 1.6% betters the industry average of 0.3%. Chubb maintained a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, including consistent cash flow generation, for the past many years. The insurer’s cash flow has been increasing over the years. This has paved the way for prudent capital deployment measures.Cincinnati Financial’s board of directors approved a dividend of 75 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a 9% increase.  This action sets the stage for the 63rd consecutive year of dividend hike. This reflects Cincinnati Financial’s strong operating performance, the board's positive outlook and confidence in outstanding capital, liquidity and financial flexibility.Shares of CINF gained 8.6% year to date while that of HMN and CB lost 8.9% and 12%, respectively, in the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, GE has made an equity investment in Svante as a part of Svante’s US $318-million Series E fundraising round in December 2022.In 2022, GE announced that GE Vernova would spin off from GE in 2024 as a business purpose-built to lead the energy transition. This builds on GE’s sustainability commitments and position in the energy industry, where GE technology provides approximately 30% of the world’s electricity. GE is developing and commercializing a number of breakthrough technologies to drive the energy transition including carbon capture through industrial and technology research collaborations, including the agreement with and investment in Svante.""The climate crisis and our world require immediate and sustained action and investment into crucial technologies like carbon capture which can deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and play a key role in the energy transition,"" said Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova. ""We are excited to work with a technology innovator like Svante to drive collective progress on developing carbon capture solutions for the energy industry aiming to deliver more sustainable, affordable, and reliable electricity for more people.""""We are pleased to welcome GE both as a strategic commercial collaborator and an investor in Svante, alongside our other strategic value chain partners and investors,"" said Claude Letourneau, Svante’s President and CEO. ""GE’s 130+ years of experience in energy applications will be invaluable to us as we rapidly scale our operations and manufacturing capacity to be able to capture millions of tonnes of CO2 from diverse industrial sites around the world.""Story continuesSvante’s novel carbon capture filters are made by coating solid adsorbents, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), onto thin sheets of laminate that are stacked to become the company’s nano-engineered filters. These filters can be used in multiple applications for capturing CO2 at refineries, cement, steel, aluminum, lime, boilers, pulp &amp; paper, and more. The technology can be used for point-source post-combustion carbon capture in which the filters take CO2 out of industrial flue gas (the source of the emission) and prevent it from reaching the atmosphere.

To skip the industry analysis and the recent market behavior around the stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now.The alternative fuel or renewable energy industry is one of the trending industries in the world at the moment. We previously reported that the renewable energy sector is expected to grow at 4% per annum and the annual supply and production investments will reach around $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion by 2035. Wind, solar, hydropower, and biofuel energy are all examples of alternative or renewable fuels.Wind Energy MarketThe wind energy market is the fastest-growing renewable energy industry with a forecasted CAGR of 9.4% between 2021 and 2030. The global wind energy market was valued at $77.77 billion which is expected to reach $174.75 billion by 2030. The International Energy Agency reported that wind generation increased by 17% in 2021 to 273 TerraWatt per hour (1 TerraWatt = 8,760 TerraWatt/hour), representing a 55% higher growth than the prior year.In 2021, China accounted for 70% of the total wind energy growth, followed by the U.S. at a meager 14%. However, due to low wind conditions, the EU saw a decline of 3% in wind power generation in the year. The U.S. installed 13.4 GigaWatts of wind capacity in 2021 and the industry serves around 40 million homes in the country and employs around 120,000 people.Solar Power MarketThe solar power market size was around $167.84 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% to $373.84 billion in 2029. Solar power is the second fastest-growing renewable energy source after wind and hit 1 Terrawatt of generation capacity in 2022. Between 2018 and 2021, the global solar capacity doubled and saw a huge surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic while representing a growth of 17% in 2020 from the previous year. According to a SolarPower Europe report, the global solar power capacity is expected to reach 2.3 TerraWatt in 2025.Story continuesAccording to the International Energy Agency, in 2021, the solar power generation capacity grew by 22% globally. China was responsible for the most significant growth as it accounted for 38% of the solar photovoltaic technology growth, followed by the U.S. at 17%, and the EU at 10%.Hydro Electric Power MarketHydropower is one of the oldest sources of renewable energy. In the United States, it accounted for 31.5% of renewable energy electricity generation. Globally, it accounted for 17% of the total electricity generation in 2020. The global hydropower market size was $236.4 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.16% to $371.8 billion by 2030. Hydropower is the largest renewable energy source in the world with 4,327 GigaWatts of generation capacity in 2021. However, in the same year, due to its high dependence on water, its generation capacity decreased by 0.4% globally. The droughts in countries such as Brazil, the United States, Turkey, China, India, and Canada were one of the main reasons for the decline in hydropower electricity generation capacity.Renewable Energy MarketBy 2027, the International Energy Agency predicts that the total renewable energy generation is expected to increase by 60%. One of the most significant factors of clean energy growth is its low cost. With uncertainties in the conventional energy market, as seen post-Russia-Ukraine war, new solar or wind power plants sometimes have a lower cost of electricity generation than the existing conventional energy generation facilities. Additionally, the tax incentives to renewable energy companies through the Inflation Reduction Act are another major growth driver for the clean energy industry.Currently, coal is the largest source of electricity generation but the IEA expects that renewable energy electricity generation is expected to double in the next 5 years and will surpass coal.Over the past few days, the renewable energy market, especially solar, was significantly hit by the Silicon Valley Bank crash. Recently, clean energy stocks like Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) fell, while related ETFs like Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) also took a hit.The global clean energy market might have hit a snag due to the recent uncertainties in the equities market but it is bound to grow at a remarkable pace in the long term. Some of the biggest players in the clean energy market are Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE).11 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right NowOur MethodologyAfter analyzing the global clean energy market, we chose the most popular alternative fuel stocks from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now11.

(NYSE:NEE), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are some of the noteworthy clean energy stocks along with JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:JKS)10. Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is a renewable energy company owned by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. It is one of the most sustainable companies in the world as it has strong financial backing from a huge asset management company. According to its 2022 annual report, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) plans to invest $12 billion over the next five years toward renewable energy growth. The company also mentioned that its global renewable power development pipeline includes 110 gigawatts of electricity.Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is quite undervalued compared to its peers as its price-to-sales ratio currently stands at 2.9x at the time of writing, compared to its peer average of 4.2x. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Rising interest rates remain the key risk to renewables utility Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP), an underperformer in the fourth quarter, though we view Brookfield’s stable fundamentals (with &gt;90% of contracted cash flows having an average term of 14 years), inflation protection (~70% of power purchase agreements are indexed to inflation) and long-term growth opportunities as attractive in the current environment. Brookfield’s balance sheet is also relatively well-protected against rising rates given it has 97% fixed-rate debt with an average term to maturity of 12 years.”9. Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA) is one of the largest geothermal companies in the world. The company owns geothermal and energy recovery power plants and provides turbines, generators, and heat exchangers. It is headquartered in Nevada, USA, and operates globally.In the fourth quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds had a stake worth $188.97 million in Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA). In the previous quarter, the number of hedge funds holding the company shares was 16 with a combined value of a little over $195 million.According to Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA)’s Q4 2022 earnings report, the company had a non-GAAP EPS of $0.73, outperforming the estimates by 25 cents.

For 2023, the company guided its revenue estimates to the range of $823 million and $858 million, compared to the $865.68 million consensus.Massif Capital made the following comment about Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We shorted Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ORA) last year as the firm appeared to be an unprofitable geothermal-focused independent energy producer borrowing money to grow an even less-profitable U.S. renewables energy business. Along with eroding the company’s margins, we expected numerous executional challenges in the build-out of Ormat’s new U.S. renewable business. We got impatient as it increased from our short price of roughly $75 to $100, and we closed out the position. At the time, we noted the following:“Reviewed earnings [3rd Qtr 2022] and found that although execution had struggled, the impact was minimal, the future impact of the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] on the firm’s independent power production is uncertain (although almost assuredly positive), as such the business appears likely to maintain, at least for some period, its high earnings margins relative to independent power producing peers. We cannot find a reason to question the high margins’ near-term sustainability, but long-term sustainability should be in question. Nevertheless, we do not see a catalyst in the future to prompt a repricing or reevaluation of the multiple being placed on unsus[1]tainably high earnings or a catalyst that will send the high margins lower in short order, despite the fact the stock is clearly overvalued on fundamental earnings and cash flow basis. Absent a catalyst, it seemed prudent to exit the position.”…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Clearway Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:VST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“I sent the 2019 letter on February 10, 2020. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) closed that day at $22.27. As I write in early January the price is $22.30. Now I did say “We would actually prefer it if both (VST &amp; NRG) securities went nowhere for as long possible”—assuming repurchased shares at depressed valuations was our best-case scenario. But A) I didn’t think I’d be that right with respect to “nowhere”, and B) I certainly didn’t think I’d be right 3-years on. Here we are though, with the stock literally going nowhere for the last 3-years. Just like we drew it up!“Management has indeed repurchased 20.3% of the shares outstanding since year-end 2019 and will probably repurchase another 12-15% of the outstanding shares in 2023. My initial assumption was that management could plausibly repurchase 60% of their shares by 2030, leaving them with 200mn outstanding (that assumed shares were appreciating and they had to pay more as the years went on, not what’s transpired so far), but at the current pace of about 50mn shares repurchased per year, they’ll hit that mark by the end of 2026, which would imply free cash flow of $10 pershare if the underlying business continues to perform as it currently is. That’s a 45% FCF yield on today’s price. Meanwhile, dividends per share have grown 54% since 2019 and the stock now yields 3.5%, growing about 15% a year.Being paid to wait makes waiting much easier. We had sold VST shares in mid-2020, replacing some of the position with call options, to free up capital for other opportunities that became available. But when winter storm Uri hit Texas in February 2021 and VST shares went down 20%+, below $17 a share, we rebuilt our common equity position. Today VST oscillates between the biggest and second biggest position in the fund, depending on weekly performance.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now. Suggested Articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 11 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

749,6bc3a2fa-0782-35ea-b141-8adc1784308a,GE,2023-03-23,15 Best Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-augmented-reality-stocks-181314519.html,1679249594,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'GE', 'MSFT', 'AMD', 'SNAP', 'ANSS', 'BIDU', 'PTC', 'QCOM', 'HPE', 'VUZI', 'SPLK']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best augmented reality stocks to buy now. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now. Augmented reality is set to revolutionize the ways we interact with our surroundings. Most folks often confuse augmented reality with virtual reality, and for the sake of this piece, it's better to first understand what both terms mean. Simply put, augmented reality is an 'enhancement' of reality itself in a virtual manner, while virtual reality 'transports' the user into an altogether different environment. In essence, while all augmented reality is virtual reality, the vice versa is false.With that out of the way, let's take a look at the many ways in which augmented reality is transforming businesses and by extension, the general consumer's interaction with them. One such use case was applied in London's Gatwick International Airport - one of the busiest airports in the country. This saw management place 2,000 beacons inside the airport's two terminals, with the aim to allow passengers to navigate between entering the airport and boarding their flight. The beacons enabled travelers to identify their route and location within the airport and locate gates, desks, and other facilities.Another remarkable use of augmented reality, this time in an industrial context, is the use of Google Glass by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). While Google announced in March 2023 that it will stop selling the Google Glass Enterprise Edition and continue replacing damaged hardware until September, General Electric has already put the augmented reality product to great use. The firm, whose operations involve manufacturing precision components for machines such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, reports that by using Google Glass and augmented reality, it was able to increase its order completion time by a whopping 46%. GE's Healthcare division has also partnered with a medical technology company to develop the OmnifyXR Interventional Suite System. Through this, the firm aims to provide physicians with the remarkable opportunity to view a patient's anatomy holographically by using Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s HoloLens technology - which is also used in accessories for the firm's Xbox gaming console.Story continuesIn addition to manufacturing and navigation, augmented reality can also play a major role in revolutionizing marketing, according to Deloitte. Deloitte believes that augmented reality will allow for a greater connection between the advertisement agencies and their target audience, through better storytelling and a greater immersive experience. For these immersive stores, advertisers need to apply virtual reality thoughtfully, understand the story, do not force the brand into the story, and ensure that the customer is actually receptive to the content being delivered.Finally, shifting back to the consumer end, another key industry that is also using augmented reality is the electronic commerce industry. McKinsey outlines that retail consumers in the UK, Germany, and France strongly resonate with augmented reality features offered by electronic commerce platforms which allow them to 'test' products before making a purchase.All these, and many more use cases paint a bright picture for the augmented reality market. A research report from International Data Corporation (IDC) outlines a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.3% for the industry. IDC estimated in November 2022 that global AR/VR spending totaled $13.8 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR until 2026 when it will sit at $50.9 billion. It adds that industrial uses and training applications will continue to be the strongest segments of the market, and will account for 44% of the total presence. It adds that the gaming segment will account for 25% of the total market. IDC also shares eye popping growth rates for the different industry segments, as it outlines that growth in emergency response applications will be double the rate of the overall market by marking an 82.9% growth rate. The U.S. will account for one third of the market, and China will grow at a 42.2% CAGR.This high growth rate was also corroborated by the management of Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI), an American firm that makes and sells augmented and virtual reality devices. At a recent earnings call conference, management revealed that:It bears repeating that the use of augmented reality by most business organizations and, ultimately, consumers remains the wave of the future. Despite the technical challenges encountered when making AR glasses and their uneven and unpredictable adoption curve seen to date, most entities around the world are realigning their future strategies around AR glasses with AI. The expected ubiquitous use of AI across applications in areas such as education, e-commerce, health care, communications, defense, security and more that hand the glove with AR smart glasses, examples like visual search, language translation, voice control, the list goes on and on.This marriage of technology will accelerate the need and use cases for lightweight wearable displays. Vuzix is an AR smart glasses optics and display engine pioneer. The company was built from the ground up over the last 25 years to deliver on the larger promise of AR and, as such, is well positioned to participate in this emerging market.Today, we'll look at some top augmented reality companies, with the notable picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

751,2ac6e485-0539-3470-8c2c-1acf95bbecb6,VLO,2023-03-23,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Valero Energy (VLO): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133001220.html,1679491801,STORY,['VLO'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Valero Energy (VLO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Valero Energy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is VLO Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.5% over the past month to $24.37.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Valero Energy may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

752,c46745e4-9b6c-34b8-a9c5-b3abe422766b,VLO,2023-03-23,Rio Tinto's and Adidas have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tintos-adidas-highlighted-zacks-113111890.html,1679484671,STORY,"['RIO', 'ADS.DE', 'SI=F', '^GSPC', 'MPC', 'VLO', 'CVI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 22, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Rio Tinto's RIO as the Bull of the Day and Adidas ADDYY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CVR Energy CVI, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Valero Energy VLO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Mining-Miscellaneous Industry is currently in the top 30% of over 248 Zacks Industries and Rio Tinto's stock is standing out with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and overall ""A"" VGM grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Rio Tinto is positioned to benefit from its strong business environment and higher commodity prices as an international miner of aluminum, borax, coal, copper and iron ore, lead, gold and silver, uranium, titanium, and diamonds among others. The Australian-based miner has mining operations in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe, and Canada.Good Value Following another strong year, Rio Tinto's earnings are expected to dip -9% to $7.38 per share in fiscal 2023 compared to EPS of $8.15 in 2022. However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rebound and rise 4% to $7.70 per share.Plus, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher for FY23 as commodity prices have remained higher in correlation with inflation. Rio Tinto's FY23 EPS estimates have jumped 13% throughout the quarter with FY24 estimates up 2%.Even better, the rising earnings estimates support the case that Rio Tinto's stock appears to be undervalued. Shares of RIO trade around $66 and just 9X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500's 18.1X and its industry average of 10X. Rio Tinto stock also trades 72% below its decade-long high of 32.2X and at a slight discount to the median of 10.1X.Total ReturnYear to date, Rio Tinto stock is down -7% but this year's drop may be a buying opportunity, especially when considering RIO's stellar dividend. To that point, RIO's total return including dividends over the last three years is still +139% to easily top the S&amp;P 500's +85% and the Mining-Miscellaneous Markets' +92%.Story continuesAt the moment, Rio Tinto's annual dividend yield is 6.76% at $4.49 per share. This is well above the S&amp;P 500's 1.61% average and the Mining-Miscellaneous Markets' 4.36%. More Impressive, Rio Tinto's annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 14.19%.TakeawayThe rising earnings estimate revisions are a good sign that Rio Tinto will continue to benefit from higher commodity prices. On top of this, shares of RIO look undervalued from a price to earnings perspective, making the stock very attractive considering its stellar dividend and inflation-fighting ability. Furthermore, the Average Zacks Price Target of $90.50 per share suggests 36% upside from current levels.Bear of the Day:Adidas stock may be in store for a bearish downturn landing a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment. To that point, the Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is also in the bottom 11% of over 248 Zacks Industries.On top of high inflation disrupting consumer spending, the footwear and apparel provider is dealing with massive revenue losses from severing its partnership with Kanye West following antisemitic comments the entertainer made last year.Declining Earnings Estimates Adidas has stated it expects to lose $1.3 billion from cutting ties with Kanye West and discontinuing his popular Yeezy brand with the trendy shoes once retailing between $200-585 per pair.Adidas also expects to lose up to $534 million in operating profit from the breakup. Confirming this is the declining earnings estimate revisions. Adidas is now expected to have an adjusted loss of -$.1.54 per share this year compared to estimates of $2.13 a share 90 days ago. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have declined 53%.Poor Performance &amp; CompetitionLosing the popularity of its Yeezy brand, Adidas could lose many fashion consumers back to its main competitor Nike. Adidas stock is up +12% year to date to top Nike's +6% and the S&amp;P 500's +3%.However, the rebound attempt may be overdone considering the decline in earnings estimates as Adidas stock Is still down -54% over the last two years to largely underperform Nike's -10% and the benchmark.Furthermore, over the last decade, Adidas is only up +47% and has continued to lag the S&amp;P 500's +154%, Nike's +319%, and the Shoe &amp; Retail Apparel Markets +273%. This purgatory-like performance could continue with other companies like New Balance and Skechers becoming more fashionable and capitalizing on trends among younger generations.Bottom LineInvestors will want to be cautious of Adidas stock as the earnings picture continues to decline for the company. With inflation headwinds still affecting the broader Consumer Discretionary sector, ending its Yeezy partnership has unfortunately added more financial risk to Adidas and opened the door for increased competition.Additional content:3 Stocks for Oil &amp; Gas Contrarians to BuyNow that oil prices are below $70 a barrel it seems investors have lost faith in their energy investments. But what if the recent drop in oil and sentiment is just a fake out?Bolstered by geopolitical tensions, high inflation, and anemic domestic production, energy stocks posted a banner year in 2022. Energy was the only sector in the market that finished last year in the green, and it did so emphatically, up nearly 60%.With higher interest rates and now a banking crisis many analysts think a recession is just around the corner. That would be bad for oil demand and energy stocks. But last week OPEC publicly committed to significantly cutting production, putting a floor under the price of oil. And now with the Fed potentially easing off the interest rate hikes, it is possible there is another rally in inflation.Additionally, there is this kind of well-known investor names Warren Buffett who knows a thing or two about investing in stocks. Buffett cannot stop buying oil stocks, indicating that he thinks energy is still an appealing investment.The price of oil is down nearly 50% from its 2022 high, yet many of the top oil and gas stocks are still holding up well. Even after the tremendous run up energy stocks had in 2022, many of them still boast reasonable valuations. In this article I will cover three highly ranked energy stocks that have forward earnings multiples below 10x, which help make them very compelling investments right now.CVR EnergyHeadquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel. CVI owns and operates a coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Kansas and a crude oil refinery in Oklahoma. The business serves retailers, railroads, farms and other refineries and marketers.CVR Energy is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. CVI has been a strong performing stock over the last year and offers a very generous dividend yield of 6.5%.Over the next few earnings periods sales are expected to fall, but current quarter earnings are still expected to skyrocket 4,300% YoY to $0.88 per share. Over the last 60 days analysts have unanimously revised earnings higher across all reporting periods. Current year earnings expectations have nearly doubled over the last three months.CVI is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 9x, which is below its 10-year median of 12x, and above the industry average 5x.Marathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Marathon Petroleum's Refining and Marketing unit operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics, transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC stock has been extremely strong over the last year. It has outperformed the industry and market considerably. Even with the weakness in the sector, its share price is still very close to breaking out to new all-time highs again.Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating an upward trend in earnings revisions. While sales are projected to fall across the board, earnings have been revised higher nonetheless. Additionally, it has a very impressive earnings surprise prediction. The stock is expected to beat on all the next earnings reports, with next quarter projected to beat by 28%.MPC is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6x, which is just above the industry average of 5x, and well below its five-year median of 11x. Marathon Petroleum also offers a dividend yield of 2.4%, which it has boosted by an average of 12% annually over the last three years.Valero EnergyValero Energy is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO's refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO stock has been a very strong performer over the last year. The stock has more than tripled the returns of its respective industry and trounced the returns of the broad market.Valero Energy earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 186% YoY to $6.62 per share, while current quarter sale are expected to drop -13% to $33.5 billion.Although there have been some slight revisions lower in the current quarter recently, earnings have still been revised considerably higher over the last three months. Furthermore, all other earnings periods have been revised considerably higher, with current year earnings being upgraded by 36%.VLO is trading at a very reasonable 5x one-year forward earnings, which is in line with the industry and well below its five-year median of 13x. VLO also offers a dividend yield of 3.2%, which has been raised by an average of 4.8% annually over the last five years.ConclusionThere has been a major rotation out of energy stocks, yet based on the valuations and improving earnings expectations, they are still compelling investments. While energy prices have been rolling over for the better part of the last year, many of these stocks have held up very well. As uncomfortable as it is sometimes going against can be a profitable endeavor.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

DRI, The Interpublic Group of Companies IPG, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP and Valero Energy VLO.5 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks to Counter Market VolatilityDividend investing gained popularity in recent weeks as the banking crisis ignited worries about a broader credit crunch and liquidity strains across the market. This is especially true as dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Darden Restaurants Inc., The Interpublic Group of Companies, Microchip Technology Inc. and Valero Energy — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill:India-based Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an integrated global pharmaceutical company engaged in providing affordable and innovative medicines since 1984. The company has an estimated earnings growth of 45.1% for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) and delivered an earnings surprise of 48.61% over the last four quarters.At present, RDY has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of A.

754,b1129114-0652-39e1-a3a7-ab83007a4e6c,VLO,2023-03-23,3 Stocks for Oil and Gas Contrarians to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-oil-gas-contrarians-184806935.html,1679424486,STORY,"['MPC', 'VLO', 'CVI']","[Now that oil prices are below $70 a barrel it seems investors have lost faith in their energy investments. But what if the recent drop in oil and sentiment is just a fake out?Bolstered by geopolitical tensions, high inflation, and anemic domestic production, energy stocks posted a banner year in 2022. Energy was the only sector in the market that finished last year in the green, and it did so emphatically, up nearly 60%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith higher interest rates and now a banking crisis many analysts think a recession is just around the corner. That would be bad for oil demand and energy stocks. But last week OPEC publicly committed to significantly cutting production, putting a floor under the price of oil. And now with the Fed potentially easing off the interest rate hikes, it is possible there is another rally in inflation.Additionally, there is this kind of well-known investor names Warren Buffett who knows a thing or two about investing in stocks. Buffett cannot stop buying oil stocks, indicating that he thinks energy is still an appealing investment.The price of oil is down nearly 50% from its 2022 high, yet many of the top oil and gas stocks are still holding up well. Even after the tremendous run up energy stocks had in 2022, many of them still boast reasonable valuations. In this article I will cover three highly ranked energy stocks that have forward earnings multiples below 10x, which help make them very compelling investments right now.CVR EnergyHeadquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Energy CVI is an independent refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel. CVI owns and operates a coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Kansas and a crude oil refinery in Oklahoma. The business serves retailers, railroads, farms and other refineries and marketers.CVR Energy is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. CVI has been a strong performing stock over the last year and offers a very generous dividend yield of 6.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the next few earnings periods sales are expected to fall, but current quarter earnings are still expected to skyrocket 4,300% YoY to $0.88 per share. Over the last 60 days analysts have unanimously revised earnings higher across all reporting periods. Current year earnings expectations have nearly doubled over the last three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCVI is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 9x, which is below its 10-year median of 12x, and above the industry average 5x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum MPC is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Marathon Petroleum’s Refining and Marketing unit operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics, transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC stock has been extremely strong over the last year. It has outperformed the industry and market considerably. Even with the weakness in the sector, its share price is still very close to breaking out to new all-time highs again.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating an upward trend in earnings revisions. While sales are projected to fall across the board, earnings have been revised higher nonetheless. Additionally, it has a very impressive earnings surprise prediction. The stock is expected to beat on all the next earnings reports, with next quarter projected to beat by 28%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMPC is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6x, which is just above the industry average of 5x, and well below its five-year median of 11x. Marathon Petroleum also offers a dividend yield of 2.4%, which it has boosted by an average of 12% annually over the last three years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero EnergyValero Energy VLO is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO’s refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO stock has been a very strong performer over the last year. The stock has more than tripled the returns of its respective industry and trounced the returns of the broad market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 186% YoY to $6.62 per share, while current quarter sale are expected to drop -13% to $33.5 billion.Although there have been some slight revisions lower in the current quarter recently, earnings have still been revised considerably higher over the last three months. Furthermore, all other earnings periods have been revised considerably higher, with current year earnings being upgraded by 36%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO is trading at a very reasonable 5x one-year forward earnings, which is in line with the industry and well below its five-year median of 13x. VLO also offers a dividend yield of 3.2%, which has been raised by an average of 4.8% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConclusionThere has been a major rotation out of energy stocks, yet based on the valuations and improving earnings expectations, they are still compelling investments. While energy prices have been rolling over for the better part of the last year, many of these stocks have held up very well. As uncomfortable as it is sometimes going against can be a profitable endeavor.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Being one of the largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico producers, Hess is well-positioned to capitalize on the improving crude price.Hess made multiple oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana, where discoveries are lining up one after another. The company recently made an oil discovery at the Fangtooth SE-1 well, which will add to the block’s recoverable resource estimate of more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The discovery has the potential to support future oil development on the Stabroek Block.For 2023, Hess expects net production (excluding Libya) of 355,000-365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), indicating an increase from 344,000 Boe/d reported in 2022. Coupled with higher oil prices, increased production will boost the company’s bottom line.Hess recently announced a regular quarterly dividend of 43.75 cents per share, payable to holders of record at the close of business on Mar 13, 2023. The figure reflects a roughly 17% increase over the fourth-quarter 2022 dividend. This reflects the company’s strong commitment to returning capital to its shareholders.Hess expects operating cash flow to expand, seeing a compound annual growth rate of 25% through 2027. This increases the probability of future dividend hikes, thereby illustrating Hess’ robust and stable business growth.Numerous factors are aiding the stock price surge for HES and are creating more room for upside. Hess is expecting significant free cash flow growth in the coming years, which will get allocated toward reducing debt load and returning capital to shareholders.Story continuesRisksOne factor that can offset the positives to some extent is Hess’ aggressive capital spending budget, which remains a headwind for the company. For 2023, the company expects to incur capital and exploratory expenditure of $3.7 billion. This suggests a 32% hike from last year’s reported figure.Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sunoco LP’s SUN fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of 42 cents per unit missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. Weak quarterly earnings resulted from the higher total cost of sales and operating expenses.Sunoco has witnessed upward estimate revisions for 2023 earnings in the past 30 days. For 2023, Sunoco expects adjusted EBITDA of $850-$900 million.RPC Inc.’s RES adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share in the fourth quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. The strong quarterly results were backed by higher activity levels in all the service lines and rising equipment utilization.As of Dec 31, RPC had cash and cash equivalents of $126.4 million, up sequentially from $73.2 million. Nonetheless, the company managed to maintain a debt-free balance sheet.Valero Energy Corporation’s VLO fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $8.45 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45 per share. The strong quarterly results were driven by increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin.Valero can benefit from the Gulf Coast export volumes as fuel demand recovery gets support from Asia economies. The Gulf Coast contributed 59.4% to the total throughput volume in the fourth quarter of 2022.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

759,d53a1b39-1782-3aa3-b0f5-c0738eb64a02,UNH,2023-03-23,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-attracting-130001280.html,1679490001,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -2.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.23 per share, indicating a change of +13.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.91 points to a change of +12.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.22 indicates a change of +13.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $89.35 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $358.97 billion and $383.77 billion estimates indicate +10.7% and +6.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $82.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $5.34 for the same period compares with $4.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +3.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for UnitedHealth Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$28b ÷ (US$246b - US$89b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.4% it's much better. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering UnitedHealth Group here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 77% in that time. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 136% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.While UnitedHealth Group doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230322005047/en/(Graphic: Business Wire)The survey also found gaps in awareness among college students regarding how to access mental and behavioral health care, uncovered student misconceptions about cost and ease of access for these services, and showed a correlation between students’ self-reported mental health concerns and doubts about on-time graduation.The survey found students are self-reporting that they or a roommate or friend encountered mental or behavioral health concerns in the past year – including anxiety (55%), depression (41%) and eating disorders (11%) – and 15% of those students who have not sought help for behavioral or mental health concerns say it’s because they don’t know how to access on-campus behavioral and mental health services. Of particular concern, suicidal ideation and intent was self-reported by 13% of student respondents.""It may not be surprising that some students and parents have different perceptions of the college experience, but this report demonstrates the need to create environments for ongoing meaningful conversations with these emerging adults,"" said Dr. Donald Tavakoli, national medical director for behavioral health, UnitedHealthcare. ""We need to work with students to educate them on their options for mental and behavioral support. Colleges, parents, health care providers and health plans all can play a role in supporting navigation to appropriate care.""Story continuesCommissioned by UnitedHealthcare and conducted by YouGov, ""The College Student Behavioral Health Report"" surveyed a total sample of 1,034 Americans, of whom 506 were college students, and 528 were parents of college students, enrolled in an institution of higher education across the country.Data reveal college students may be struggling with more than typical exam stress – and parents may underestimate the frequency of serious mental health concerns.Student respondents self-reported that they or a roommate or friend encountered potentially life-threatening mental or behavioral health concerns during the past year, including depression, eating disorders and suicidal ideation and intent, but survey data indicate that parents may not always be aware. For example:41% of students self-reported they encountered or managed depression, while only 22% of parents said their students had this experience.11% of students self-reported they encountered or managed eating disorders compared to only 5% of parents who said their students had this experience.Of particular note, 13% of students self-reported they encountered or managed suicidal ideation and intent, while only 4% of parents said their students had this experience.Students cite barriers to accessing mental or behavioral health care.When asked why students did not seek mental or behavioral care, among those not seeking it, parents were more likely than students (73% versus 49%) to say it was because their children did not need mental or behavioral health support. In contrast, students self-reported they did not seek help for reasons that point to perceptions around cost, difficulty in getting appointments and a lack of knowledge about where to access resources. Survey results showed:Among students who did not seek help for behavioral or mental health concerns, 60% self-reported they or a college friend/roommate did need help but did not seek it because it is too expensive (38%), they did not know where to find behavioral or mental health resources (23%), and/or that it took too long to get an appointment (21%).31% of respondents said they or their student did not know how to access on-campus behavioral or mental health services or believed their school does not offer them.College students who did need support, but did not seek it, were more than twice as likely (38%) as parents (16%) to report that they did not seek help because it is too expensive.Mental or behavioral health concerns may be linked to doubts about graduating on time.For students who encountered mental or behavioral health concerns during the past year, survey results showed increased rates of doubts about on-time graduation – particularly among those whose self-reported concerns may be life-threatening, such as suicidal ideation and intent (88% doubt their ability to graduate on time), eating disorders (82% doubt their ability to graduate on time), or depression (79% doubt their ability to graduate on time). In contrast, only 30% of students who did not self-report encountering mental or behavioral health concerns in the past year doubt their ability to graduate on time.Solutions may include increased communication among students, families, colleges and providers.""Recognizing that college students may be facing more than just stress about schoolwork is an important first step in encouraging dialogue and increasing support. It’s critical that colleges, families, providers and health plans work together to provide resources and support to students where and when they need it,"" added Dr. Tavakoli.Steps toward reducing barriers to care, both real and perceived, may include:Increasing communications with students and families on where and how to access care, even when it may be difficult.Sharing guidance with students and families on how to understand and take advantage of student health insurance plans and/or family insurance benefits while in college, including clear information about what plan students have, what benefits are included and how to utilize services such as virtual care that may make mental and behavioral health support more readily accessible in moments of need.Dispelling misperceptions around cost, wait time and appointment availability, so that students better understand their own options for care, and can also provide guidance to friends or roommates who may encounter mental or behavioral health challenges.In addition to advocacy and resources for mental health programs, UnitedHealthcare offers helpful parent and youth ""conversation starter cards"" that are designed to help parents talk to their kids about mental well-being and that try to spark conversations that move past one-word answers.For more information about behavioral health resources, visit UHC.com.About UnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare is dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone by simplifying the health care experience, meeting consumer health and wellness needs, and sustaining trusted relationships with care providers.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Estée Lauder Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$21b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Personal Products industry average of 16%. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Estée Lauder Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Estée Lauder Companies.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Estée Lauder Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 17% from 24% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Estée Lauder Companies' ROCEIn summary, Estée Lauder Companies is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 67% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Estée Lauder Companies does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies  that you might be interested in.While Estée Lauder Companies isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

EL has a strong presence in emerging markets, insulating it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The beauty company’s strong online business is a major growth engine. Yet, the company is not immune to inflationary pressures and supply chain-related issues.Let’s delve deeper.What’s Favoring The Estee Lauder Companies?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a strong presence in emerging markets. The company derives significant revenues from emerging markets like Thailand, India, Russia and Brazil, encouraging it to make distributional, digital and marketing investments in these countries.

The company posted strong double-digit organic sales growth across several emerging markets like India, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia.The company is on track to expand its consumer reach in productive distribution across high-growth channels while strategically expanding brands into new countries. In this regard, management strengthened its manufacturing, distribution and innovation capabilities.

COVID-19 continued affecting the company’s operating environment throughout the first half of fiscal 2023, which included curbs in China that weighed on travel retail in Hainan and retail traffic in mainland China. Results were affected by increased inflation, concerns surrounding the recession and unfavorable currency rates.The Estee Lauder Companies’ fiscal second-quarter gross profit came in at $3,401 million, down 21% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 73.6% from 77.9% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside can be attributed to inflationary pressures across the supply chain, region and category mix and increased costs associated with promotional items. Also, the adjusted operating income declined 42% at cc, mainly due to reduced net sales.Management anticipates the rest of fiscal 2023 to be dynamic, including uncertain consumer recovery in travel retail, evolving COVID-19 situation, inflation, supply chain-related issues and slowdown risk across some markets worldwide. For fiscal 2023, management projects net sales to decrease in the band of 5-7% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected in the band of $4.87-$5.02, suggesting a 31-33% decline from the year-ago period. The bottom line is expected to decline 27-29% at constant currency.That said, The Estee Lauder Companies’ aforementioned upsides are likely to offer some respite.

On that day, Procter &amp; Gamble is projected to report earnings of $1.32 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 0.75%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $19.32 billion, down 0.32% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.84 per share and revenue of $80.36 billion, which would represent changes of +0.52% and +0.22%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Procter &amp; Gamble.

777,b69d187d-7bcb-39d7-96d9-1fdc0df50fdb,PG,2023-03-23,Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-pg-trending-130001254.html,1679403601,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +3.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has gained 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of -0.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.4% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.36 billion and $83.76 billion estimates indicate +0.2% and +4.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%. The EPS surprise was +0.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In 2022, dividends remained a bright spot for investors, despite a stock market plunge. Global dividends grew to a record level last year due to investors’ inclination toward income-generating stocks. According to a report by Barron’s, global dividends increased by 8.4% to $1.56 trillion in 2022, massively driven by energy companies and larger banks. The report further mentioned that overall 12 countries achieved dividend records in dollars.Last year’s returns also comply with the fact that dividend stocks remained on strong footing relative to the broad market. The S&amp;P 500 ended 2022 down more than 18%, compared with a 6.21% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. Moreover, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44% return of the Russell 2000 Index.As investors face new economic challenges, analysts expect overall dividend growth to slow down this year. According to Janus Henderson, global year-over-year dividend growth is likely to slow to 2.3% in dollar terms. However, slow dividend growth doesn’t signal wider dividend cuts across US companies. Max Wasserman, founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital, spoke to Wall Street Journal about this year’s dividend growth outlook. He said:“The increases may not be sky high. If a company has been raising the dividend by 5%, you might see them do 3% this year. But we expect to see increases if that’s the path they have been on.”Wasserman further asserted that dividend cuts are a result of poor strategies related to capital allocation. Companies with high payout ratios often become victims of dividend cuts. For this reason, analysts recommend investing in companies with strong balance sheets and solid business models. Daniel Sotiroff, a senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services, highlighted the importance of dividend-focused funds to find protection in the current market environment. He spoke to the same media channel about possible dividend investment strategies and said:Story continues“When you are focused on companies that are growing the dividend, that tends to mean that these are highly profitable companies. Investing in them can be a defensive investment in times of uncertainty.”This statement establishes that dividend growers is a good investment option during inflationary periods. Previous analysis of dividend growers also shows that these securities have performed well in comparison to their peers. According to a report by Merrill Edge, Dividend Aristocrats— the companies that have raised their dividend for over 25 years— delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same time.

(DAL) is benefiting from its strong liquidity position and the buoyant air travel demand scenario. However, escalating fuel cost is worrisome.Factors Favoring DALDriven by buoyant demand, Delta Air generated a double-digit operating margin in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2022. In the December quarter, adjusted operating margin was 10.9%The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 8% in 2022 from 2019 (pre-coronavirus) actuals. Given this buoyant air-travel demand, Delta Air expects total revenues (adjusted) for 2023 to increase in the 15-20% range on a year-over-year basis.Delta Air’s liquidity position is encouraging. The airline ended 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $6,534 million, much higher than the current maturities of debt and financial lease of $2,534 million. This implies that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. DAL's efforts to repay its debts are encouraging too.Key RiskEscalating fuel costs pose a threat to Delta Air’s bottom line. Oil price is moving north primarily because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In fourth-quarter 2022, average fuel price per gallon (adjusted) increased 61% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $3.20. Management expects fuel price per gallon in the $3.05-$3.25 range in the March quarter.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksDelta Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Airlines is also being aided by the improved air travel demand situation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AAL reported earnings of $1.17 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.63%. For first-quarter 2023, AAL’s earnings are expected to register 100.4% growth on a year-over-year basis. For 2023, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 332% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s full-year 2023 earnings are expected to surge 332% year over year. United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand, UAL was profitable in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL.Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow 25% year over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow 50% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s full-year 2023 earnings are expected to surge 227% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moody’s attributed the decision to the rapidly deteriorating operating environment. In the United States, two major regional banks, namely, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, collapsed. Another regional bank, First Republic Bank, is on life support.The ongoing turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — implies that there is no end to the uncertainty and volatility that has gripped markets for quite some time. The liquidity issues have moved to Europe as well, with Swiss lender, Credit Suisse, being at the center of the turbulence. UBS has agreed to buy the beleaguered Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion.Despite the current turmoil and economic uncertainty, investors should not shun equities. So what’s the way forward to reap handsome returns from one’s portfolio even during the current uncertainty?One way to proceed in this scenario is by adhering to broker advice. By following this method, broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines AAL, CVR Energy CVI, Delek US Holdings DK, Brighthouse Financial BHF and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF should be present in an investor’s watchlist for healthy returns.Why Broker Advice Holds Value?Brokers scrutinize publicly available financial documents and attend company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is then perfect for investors to be guided by their direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons, including a favorable earnings performance, bullish guidance, product launch or an optimistic macro scenario.  To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Story continuesWinning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks by following broker actions. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is taken into consideration. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 11.9% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit is supporting growth.CVR Energy, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 40.85%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23.2% over the past 60 days.Brentwood, TN-based Delek US Holdings is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. DK’s extensive downstream operations within the Permian Basin grant it a fairly significant competitive edge over its peers in the long term.Delek US Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). DK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is in excess of 100%.Brighthouse Financial is one of the largest providers of annuity and life insurance products in the United States. A compelling suite of life and annuity products, strong market presence, exit from the transition service agreement and growing individual insurance and investment income should drive growth for this Zacks Rank #1 insurer.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BHF’s 2023 and 2024 earnings indicates a year-over-year increase of 33.5% and 11.5%, respectively. The consensus estimate for 2023 and 2024 earnings has moved up 6.1% and 6.3%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch operates as a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women and kids through a network of approximately 850 stores across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.The company stated recently that its brands performed well in the holiday season.

Each are viewed as priorities in the next 5-7 years to help address the widening retirement gap that is approaching $4 trillion in the U.S.1""Understanding the evolving needs of participants and employers is critical to building relevant and meaningful retirement plans, solutions, and advice,"" said Chris Littlefield, president of Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal®.

To support an aging workforce, three out of four plan sponsors and financial professionals agree participants should have the ability to make recurring withdrawals from their employer-sponsored retirement savings as they take a phased approach to retirement.""Choosing to retire is no longer a single-step life decision. Many individuals approaching 60-65 years of age need or prefer a phased retirement, working part-time to get relief from the 40-hour work week without fear of outliving their nest eggs,"" Littlefield said.Story continuesOn the opposite end of the workforce spectrum, 76% of plan sponsors agreed the expectations of millennial and Gen Z investors will be the driving change in retirement markets by 2030. In particular, the preference Gen Z has to conduct most financial business online is viewed by both financial professionals (55%) and plan sponsors (47%) as the top disruptor from this generation.Personalization is paramountAccording to the Principal® Future of Retirement Survey, one growing expectation to better serve participants is an ability to provide individualized advice. More than 70% of both plan sponsors and financial professionals agreed personalized investment portfolios and managed account services will be common offerings within defined contribution plans by 2030.To offer more holistic and personal guidance, 78% of plan sponsors and 77% of financial professionals also agreed there will be a shift from improving the enrollment process for employees to improving the retirement process, which can include services such as advice, retirement planning, and creating retirement income.Financial wellness programs are also expected to emerge as an additional plan resource to further personalize the participant experience by 2030, with 85% of plan sponsors and 90% of financial professionals agreeing plan sponsors will increase the adoption of them.Outside of retirement savings programs, plan sponsors believe the top five financial wellness benefits that should be offered include helping participants establish a budget and financial plan, retirement income planning, credit card and debt counseling, healthcare planning for early retirees, and investment education.For more insights into the Principal® Future of Retirement Survey, please visit www.principal.com.About the Principal® Future of Retirement SurveyThe Future of Retirement survey was an online survey conducted by Principal from October 25, 2022, to November 14, 2022, focused specifically on the views plans sponsors and financial professionals have on the future of the retirement industry.

These stocks are also Dividend Aristocrats, raising their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Aflac (AFL)Starting out is Aflac which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Aflac is in the finance sector but as an insurance provider, it should be able to avoid much of the scrutiny and uncertainty that banks are facing.Plus, Aflac’s Insurance-Accident and Health Industry is currently in the top 4% of over 250 Zacks Industries.

Over the last three years, CINF’s +61% has slightly trailed the benchmark but roughly matched its Zacks Subindustry’s +66%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith that being said, Cincinnati Financial stock trades attractively relative to its past. At $107 per share, CINF trades at 21.6X forward earnings and above the industry average of 12.9X. However, CINF trades 31% below its decade-long high of 31.3X and at an 8% discount to the median of 23.5X with the rising earnings estimates offering further support to its P/E valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe rising earnings estimate revisions are a great sign for these Dividend Aristocrats along with their reliable dividends. This is also reassuring to investors who may have doubts about finding opportunities in the broader financial sector. In this regard, Aflac and Cincinnati Financial look like viable options and there could certainly be more upside in their stocks.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earmarked for family support services, this year's annual donation will help address patient mental and emotional well-being throughout 2023 and brings Aflac's funding support of the pediatric cancer and blood disorders cause to over $166 million since 1995.""Aflac continues to provide funding for treatment and research, but we also understand that children need more than medicine when going through a medical crisis,"" said Kathelen Amos, president of The Aflac Foundation Inc. ""For every child with a cancer or blood disorder diagnosis, there is a family in crisis. The needs and concerns of the parents and siblings include, but are not limited to, those directly concerning the patient. We are pleased to help fund the ever-increasing array of holistic and support services that Children's offers to the patients and families of the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.""Aflac's donation will help fund the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center's 35-person Family Support Team, which includes social workers, child life specialists, non-denominational chaplains and music therapists who work in tandem with medical staff to provide therapeutic activities, positive distractions and social support for both patients and families. Major medical insurance does not typically cover family support services, leaving hospitals dependent on philanthropic support to continue the program that cost the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center $2.5 million in 2021. In the same year, Family Support Team members provided services to a majority of the more than 8,000 children receiving care at the Center, many giving support to their families, as well.Story continues""Because a diagnosis of cancer or a blood disorder impacts all aspects of family life, the common goal of the specialists, therapists and volunteers that make up the Family Support Team is to ensure that the family feels cared for and supported as they adjust and cope, every step of the way,"" said Certified Child Life Specialist Lucy Tyler, the Center's lead Child Life Specialist in Outpatient Oncology. ""We concentrate on the emotional and mental aspects of a childhood illness that, if left unaddressed, can have long-term negative effects on a child and his or her family.""According to Tyler, across different roles, the support team offers distraction and fun through art and music, helps with schoolwork, explains medical procedures in terms a child can understand, provides a safe space to show anger or frustration, helps parents navigate and find financial resources, and more.The latest donation by The Aflac Foundation Inc. further strengthens the company's commitment to help support psychosocial needs of children with cancer and blood disorders such as sickle cell in addition to providing funding for treatment and research.In 2018, after nearly two years of research with health care professionals and families, Aflac introduced My Special Aflac Duck®, the award-winning robotic companion and app designed to help patients communicate their emotions with caregivers, teach them about their treatment through medical play, provide distraction and fun with music and art, reinforce comfort and coping skills, and more.To date, the company has given, free-of-charge, more than 22,000 My Special Aflac Ducks to children with cancer and sickle cell across the United States, Japan and Northern Ireland at a cost of more than $3.5 million to the company.For more information about Aflac's commitment to children with cancer and blood disorders, including how they can receive My Special Aflac Duck free of charge, visit AflacChildhoodCancer.org.

794,d16f5253-04f9-3527-b9ba-b4ba49e0665c,AFL,2023-03-23,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154503875.html,1679327103,STORY,['AFL'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusBased in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -14.8%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.74%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.49%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.8%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10.76%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 4.88%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Additionally, its presence in international markets is likely to encourage sustainable long-term growth compared with its domestically focused peers.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, the company’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations.In 2022, it signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio. Also, it has a significant number of leases lined up. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the retailer sales per square foot touched another record high of $753 for malls and outlets combined.As of Dec 31, 2022, the occupancy for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio came in at 94.9%, up from the 93.4% witnessed as of Dec 31, 2021. The base minimum rent per square foot for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio was $55.13 as of Dec 31, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Dec 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of 2.3%.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited 2022 with $7.8 billion of liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 4.8, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.Recently, SPG closed a new $5-billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the existing $4-billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, the company is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have risen 21.0% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 9.3%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has marginally moved down to $12.04 over the past week.With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for SPG. Online retailing is likely to remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Further, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for Simon Property. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate.The company has a substantial debt burden, and its share of total debt as of Dec 31, 2022 was approximately $31.5 billion. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses stands at $884.5 million, implying a rise of 16.2% year over year. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been revised 0.8% upward over the past month to $6.45.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty’s 2023 FFO per share has been revised a cent upward over the past month to $1.64.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends consecutively for 25 years or more. These stocks are popular among investors because they can generate stable and regular income for them, which tends to grow over time. In addition to this, these securities provide protection during market downturns. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022. The report also mentioned that during the 15 worst-performing months for the S&amp;P 1500 during the same period, the high-yield index fell by 7.29%, compared with a 9.58% decline in the S&amp;P Composite 1500.When investing in dividend growers, investors look beyond yield and focus on other factors, including value, cash flow, and other business fundamentals. Companies that have proven records of dividend growth remain committed to their shareholder obligation and signal that they have the ability to raise their dividends in the long term. Washington Crossing Advisors referred to data by Ned Davis Research and revealed that dividend growers delivered a higher return with lower volatility when compared with ordinary dividend payers, non-dividend companies, and dividend cutters. The report mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014 with a 15.9% annual risk. In comparison, dividend cutters returned 3.4% during this period with an annual risk of 25.1%.Dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance during inflationary periods. The same report highlighted that companies with solid dividend growth returned 6.5% from 1972 to 2014 when inflation was above 4%, compared with a negative 7.9% return of the dividend cutters.Story continuesThe arguments discussed above show that investing in quality companies with strong cash flow can protect investors from market downturns. Mike Morey, the chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, spoke to Business Insider about his winning strategy to invest in companies with solid cash generation. Here are some comments from the fund manager:""We don't have to worry about what the Fed is doing; we don't have to worry about the economic cycle. Just simply by focusing on quality companies with strong free cash flows is going to get you through any economic cycle. And looking at performance over a full cycle, we're confident we can deliver superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis.""He also recommended buying stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) because of their growth and strong balance sheets.Considering these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend aristocrat stocks in this article.14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 14 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational medical device company, headquartered in Ireland, Dublin. In its recent quarterly earnings, the company reported a strong cash position. At the end of January 2023, it had over $4.5 billion available in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $3.7 billion in the prior-year period. In nine months that ended January, the company's operating cash flow came in at $3.8 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $2.5 billion.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share on March 2. In 2022, the company took its dividend growth streak to 45 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.42%, as of March 20. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 with a Hold rating on the shares, following the company's recent quarterly earnings. The firm also expects the company to report strong fiscal 2024 guidance.At the end of Q4 2022, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) was a part of 58 hedge fund portfolios, up from 55 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's data. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced disappointing clinical trial results for a new product in its pipeline and lowered its fiscal 2023 financial guidance due to lingering supply chain issues and slower than expected medical procedure recovery.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock in March and mentioned that the company's tax litigation risk is 'well discounted'. The firm also noted that the company could see resilient consumption this year.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as recorded on March 20.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s cash position remained strong in FY22. The company's operating cash flow came in at $11 billion, whereas its free cash flow for the year stood at $9.5 billion. It remained committed to its shareholder return as it distributed over $7.6 billion to investors in dividends during the year.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q4 2022. Overall, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, worth $28.8 billion collectively.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American medical device and healthcare company that provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. Recently, the company announced the FDA approval for its blood-based laboratory test for traumatic brain injury. This lab test will give results in 18 minutes and is the first commercially available laboratory test in the US.On February 17, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its payouts for 51 years, which places it as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 20 came in at 2.09%In January, Barclays raised its price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's medical device segment.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 2022 database, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), compared with 62 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based renewable energy company that mainly specializes in energy infrastructure. On February 17, the company declared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.4675 per share. This marked the company's 27th consecutive year of dividend growth.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Among these hedge funds, Fundsmith LLP was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.20bUS$2.44bUS$2.85bUS$2.88bUS$3.38bUS$3.63bUS$3.85bUS$4.03bUS$4.19bUS$4.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.51%Est @ 5.88%Est @ 4.73%Est @ 3.93%Est @ 3.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$2.0kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$73bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$73b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$55b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$220, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sherwin-Williams as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.024. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sherwin-WilliamsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The quarterly profitability plunge to $174.8 million, down almost 27% year over year, appears to be largely the result of a one-time event: the hospital chain's decision to close its 282-bed acute care Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas this month. The company's operating expenses appear to have been growing faster than revenue across all of its acute care facilities, reaching $7.2 billion in 2022, or 94.3% of net revenues, compared with $6.4 billion, or 89.6% of net revenues, in 2021.Continue reading]"

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Universal Health Services'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Universal Health Services is:11% = US$657m ÷ US$6.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Universal Health Services' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, Universal Health Services seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Universal Health Services' decent returns aren't reflected in Universal Health Services'mediocre five year net income growth average of 2.7%. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are moderate could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Universal Health Services' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Universal Health Services fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Universal Health Services Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Universal Health Services' low three-year median payout ratio of 6.7% (or a retention ratio of 93%) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth. However, the low earnings growth number doesn't reflect this fact. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, Universal Health Services has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 6.6%. As a result, Universal Health Services' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 12% for future ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Universal Health Services has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Fix a Leak Week will be observed this week, March 20-26. The national campaign held by the EPA raises awareness about leaks and other water issues that contribute to water waste within homes and businesses.""For Illinois American Water, this week is a way to encourage our customers to use water wisely. We focus on conservation and reducing water waste every day but want our customers to see conservation can not only save money, but also help preserve water, a precious resource,"" said Beth Matthews, vice president of operations for Illinois American Water.According to the EPA, the average residence in the U.S. loses 10,000 gallons of water per year thanks to seemingly minor leaks. With more than 110 million households in the U.S., this equates to more than one trillion gallons of water lost every year due to leaks in the home. It is estimated that the average homeowner can reduce their water bills by 10 percent by addressing leaks.""Many people may not realize that even the smallest leaks can waste thousands of gallons per year, every drop adds up,"" said Matthews. ""If every one of our Illinois customers fixed a household leak, they could contribute to millions, or even billions, of gallons of water saved in a year.""Illinois American Water is committed to fixing leaks by replacing or upgrading infrastructure to support water quality, water pressure, system security and service reliability to customers.Illinois American Water also offers these helpful tips for detecting leaks:Check your Illinois American Water bill monthly.

Fixing leaks can reduce water bills by approximately 10 percent, according to the USEPA. In residences, the two most common leaks come from faucets and toilets.""Common household leaks are often easy to fix, and doing so conserves water and saves money,"" said Jeff Kaiser, Vice President of Operations for Missouri American Water. ""The financial impact of ignoring a minor leak can become significant over time and is often underestimated—every drop adds up.""Missouri American Water offers these helpful tips for detecting leaks:Monitor usage on your water bill. If you notice a spike and you haven’t recently increased your usage, like watering your lawn or filling a swimming pool, it might be because of a leak.Test your toilet. Leaks can occur in your toilet and are frequently due to an old or worn out flapper. Test for a leak by putting a drop of food coloring into the toilet tank. After 10 minutes, if any color shows up in the bowl, you have a leak.Check faucet gaskets. Check faucet gaskets and pipe fittings for surface leaks, indicated by water on the exterior of the pipes, at least once a season and especially after extreme temperature changes.Listen. One of the simplest ways to watch out for leaks is to listen for running water from your toilet and dripping from your faucets or showerheads.Check in-ground irrigation systems and hoses. Make sure they weren’t damaged by frost or freezing. An irrigation system that has a leak the size of a dime can waste about 6,300 gallons per month.Download a Leak Detection Kit.

Helping homeowners fix the drips to save money and water is the goal of the annual ""Fix a Leak Week,"" running March 20-26. Fix a Leak Week is a national campaign that helps raise awareness about leaks and other water issues that contribute to water waste within homes, and Pennsylvania American Water is joining the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promote water conservation and help provide savings to customers.""Customers might barely notice a small drip at their faucet, but at the rate of one drip per second, it can waste more than 3,000 gallons a year — enough for more than 180 showers,"" said Pennsylvania American Water Vice President of Operations Jim Runzer. ""Fortunately, most common leaks are easily detectable and correctable, which not only makes you a more environmentally conscious consumer, but also saves money on your monthly water and sewer bill.""According to the EPA, the average residence in the U.S. loses 10,000 gallons of water per year from seemingly minor leaks. With more than 110 million households in the U.S., this equates to more than one trillion gallons of water lost every year due to leaks in the home. Moreover, it is estimated that the average homeowner can reduce his or her water bills by 10 percent simply by addressing leaks.Runzer added, ""As a water utility, we work every day to practice what we preach, which is why we invest millions in our pipes each year to reduce system leaks.""Pennsylvania American Water is committed to fixing leaks in its underground network of pipes by constantly replacing and upgrading its infrastructure. Over the past five years, the company has funded more than $2 billion in system upgrades and plans to invest $450 to $600 million annually over the next several years to continue providing safe, clean, reliable, and affordable water and wastewater services to customers.Story continuesTo assist customers with at-home leak repairs and prevention, Pennsylvania American Water has helpful information including tips on finding and fixing common, and some not-so-common, indoor and outdoor water leaks along with downloadable leak detection kits, available in English and Spanish, through the company’s leak detection webpage.Pennsylvania American Water also offers these starter tips for detecting leaks:Regularly check your toilet, faucets, and pipes for leaks. If you find a leak, have it fixed as soon as possible.Reduce faucet leaks by checking faucet washers and gaskets for wear and replace them.Leaky toilets are most often the result of a worn toilet flapper. Replacing the rubber flapper is a quick fix that could save a home up to 200 gallons of water per day.For a leaky garden hose, replace the nylon or rubber hose washer and ensure a tight connection to the spigot using pipe tape and a wrench.Tighten connections on your showerheads if drips appear when the shower is off.Check your garden and lawn irrigation system for leaks.Consider installing water and energy-efficient appliances. The EPA reports that certified Energy Star washing machines use up to 35 percent less water per load. Water-saving shower heads, toilets and faucet aerators also help cut your water usage.About Pennsylvania American WaterPennsylvania American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to approximately 2.3 million people.About American WaterWith a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse U.S. publicly traded water and wastewater utility company.

No, utility firms don’t represent exciting investment sectors but that’s also the point. In some ways, their boring nature centers on their generally predictable businesses. As well, utilities command natural monopolies due to the extreme barriers to entry.Fundamentally, the best water utility stocks to buy also carry a distinct advantage: the underlying resource is the planet’s most precious. While most of the Earth is covered with water, only a small portion of it is drinkable. Further, as geopolitical tensions almost invariably rise, competition will spark for securing necessary supplies. Therefore, it just makes sense to consider these critical enterprises.CWTCalifornia Water Service$56.81SJWSJW Group$75.70VEOEFVeolia Environment$28.67AWKAmerican Water Works$141.81MSEXMiddlesex Water$76.21XYLXylem$94.73WTRGEssential Utilities$42.56InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCalifornia Water Service (CWT)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in San Jose, California, California Water Service (NYSE:CWT) provides drinking water and wastewater services. Per its public profile, it’s the third-largest investor-owned publicly traded water utility in the U.S. California Water serves two million people through subsidiaries in Hawaii, New Mexico, Washington, and its home state. Currently, CWT trades at a relative discount, shedding nearly 7% since the Jan. opener.As a utility firm, it predictably doesn’t offer standout financials. That said, on an operational level, California Water’s three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate pings at 10.8%, outpacing 61.29% of the industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 14.4%, above 82.52% of the industry. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 1.81%. Notably, CWT commands 56 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg CWT as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target reached $60.50, implying over 5% upside potential. Presenting a well-balanced profile, CWT ranks among the best water utility stocks to buy.SJW Group (SJW)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comAlso based in San Jose, SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) is a water utility processing, distribution, wholesale and retail company. Per its corporate profile, SJW serves 228,000 connections that reach over one million residents in regions of California. It also provides services for 60,000 people in Texas. So far this year, SJW dipped nearly 7%. However, in the trailing year, SJW gained approximately 14% of its equity value.Financially, SJW makes a decent case for the best water utility stocks to buy. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.5%, above 69% of the industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 20.5%, outpacing 82.2% of its rivals. In terms of profitability, the company’s net margin is 11.83%, beating out 64% of sector players. At the present juncture, SJW carries a forward yield of 1.98%. Also, it features 56 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg SJW as a consensus hold. However, their average price target is $84.50, implying over 10% upside potential.Veolia Environment (VEOEF)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockA French transnational company, Veolia Environment (OTCMKTS:VEOEF) is a utility firm covering three main service areas: water management, waste management, and energy services. Interestingly, Veolia also specializes in desalination, or the process of converting ocean water into drinking (potable) water. Since the beginning of the year, VEOEF gained over 8% of its equity value. However, it’s undervalued in the trailing year, down 13% below parity.Despite the red ink, adventurous investors of the best water utility stocks to buy should take a peek at Veolia. Regarding its financials, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 17.9%, above 70% of its peers. As well, in the past 10-year period, it posted profits in nine of them. Perhaps most attractively for prospective buyers, the market prices VEOEF at a forward multiple of 15.49. As a discount to earnings, Veolia ranks better than 60.87% of the competition. Right now, covering analysts peg VEOEF as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $31.99, implying almost 12% upside potential.American Water Works (AWK)Source: ShutterstockA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) through its subsidiaries provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its company profile, American Water serves approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. This equates to about 14 million people via 3.4 million customer connections. Despite its relevancies, since the start of the year, AWK dropped over 7% in equity value.Still, it’s worth taking a look at one of the underrated examples of the best water utility stocks to buy. Operationally, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 7.7%, outpacing 65% of its peers. In terms of earnings, the public utility carries a net margin of 21.62%. This stat boxes out 87.82% of sector peers. As well, it enjoys 10 years of profitability over the past decade. For passive income, American Water offers a forward yield of 1.84%. Notably, it features 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AWK as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $163, implying over 14% upside potential.Middlesex Water (MSEX)Source: ShutterstockBased in New Jersey, Middlesex Water (NASDAQ:MSEX) is a water utility with a long history, being first incorporated in 1897. Presently, it’s one of the middle-of-the-road enterprises among the best water utility stocks to buy, with a market capitalization of $1.34 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MSEX dipped 4%. In the trailing year, shares fell 25%, reflecting a higher-risk profile.Nevertheless, MSEX may offer a higher reward potential in exchange for that risk. In addition, its financials aren’t that bad, at least compared to other utility firms. For example, Middlesex’s three-year EBITDA growth rate pings at 12.4%, above 69.79% of competitors. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period is 18.7%, above nearly 71% of sector players. Plus, the company enjoys strong profitability with a net margin of 26.12%. Unfortunately, its forward yield doesn’t quite reflect that at 1.63%. Still, it features 27 years of consecutive dividend increases. Finally, Robert W. Baird’s Ben Kallo pegs MSEX as a buy. The experts anticipate shares hitting $88, implying almost 15% upside potential.Xylem (XYL)Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comBased in Washington, D.C., Xylem (NYSE:XYL) is a water technology provider. It serves the public utility, residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial sectors. Further, Xylem does business in more than 150 countries. Since the start of the new year, XYL declined by over 12% in market value. However, in the past 365 days, it gained more than 10%. Moving forward, it can possibly rise higher.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), XYL rates as modestly undervalued. Largely, the company’s greatest strengths arguably center on its profitability metrics. For instance, its operating margin is 11.79% in the trailing year, above 73.56% of the competition. Further, its return on equity is 10.88%, outpacing 64.31% of its peers. Presently, Xylem carries a forward yield of 1.36%. While it’s not the most generous rate of passive income, its payout ratio sits at 36.72%.Lastly, covering analysts peg XYL as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $118.43, implying nearly 22% upside potential. Therefore, for sheer capital returns potential, it’s one of the best water utility stocks to buy.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Flooded quarry for limestone mining. Turquoise water. White beaches. Water stocks.Source: Klintsou Ihar / Shutterstock.comA utility firm with stakes in several states predominantly in the Midwest and South, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. Although one of the more popular ideas among the best water utility stocks to buy, Essential also represents a volatile trade. Since the Jan. opener, WTRG slipped almost 11%. And in the trailing year, it’s down nearly 10%.Still, for the adventurous type, WTRG could be intriguing. Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company benefits from strong growth and profitability. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 28.3%, outpacing nearly 94% of the competition. For net margin, its metric of 20.33% beats out nearly 86% of sector peers. Conspicuously, Essential provides relatively solid passive income with a forward yield of 2.66%. Moreover, it commands 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg WTRG as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $54, implying over 25% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends consecutively for 25 years or more. These stocks are popular among investors because they can generate stable and regular income for them, which tends to grow over time. In addition to this, these securities provide protection during market downturns. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022. The report also mentioned that during the 15 worst-performing months for the S&amp;P 1500 during the same period, the high-yield index fell by 7.29%, compared with a 9.58% decline in the S&amp;P Composite 1500.When investing in dividend growers, investors look beyond yield and focus on other factors, including value, cash flow, and other business fundamentals. Companies that have proven records of dividend growth remain committed to their shareholder obligation and signal that they have the ability to raise their dividends in the long term. Washington Crossing Advisors referred to data by Ned Davis Research and revealed that dividend growers delivered a higher return with lower volatility when compared with ordinary dividend payers, non-dividend companies, and dividend cutters. The report mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014 with a 15.9% annual risk. In comparison, dividend cutters returned 3.4% during this period with an annual risk of 25.1%.Dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance during inflationary periods. The same report highlighted that companies with solid dividend growth returned 6.5% from 1972 to 2014 when inflation was above 4%, compared with a negative 7.9% return of the dividend cutters.Story continuesThe arguments discussed above show that investing in quality companies with strong cash flow can protect investors from market downturns. Mike Morey, the chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, spoke to Business Insider about his winning strategy to invest in companies with solid cash generation. Here are some comments from the fund manager:""We don't have to worry about what the Fed is doing; we don't have to worry about the economic cycle. Just simply by focusing on quality companies with strong free cash flows is going to get you through any economic cycle. And looking at performance over a full cycle, we're confident we can deliver superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis.""He also recommended buying stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) because of their growth and strong balance sheets.Considering these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend aristocrat stocks in this article.14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 14 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022.

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational medical device company, headquartered in Ireland, Dublin. In its recent quarterly earnings, the company reported a strong cash position.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced disappointing clinical trial results for a new product in its pipeline and lowered its fiscal 2023 financial guidance due to lingering supply chain issues and slower than expected medical procedure recovery.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock in March and mentioned that the company's tax litigation risk is 'well discounted'. The firm also noted that the company could see resilient consumption this year.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as recorded on March 20.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s cash position remained strong in FY22. The company's operating cash flow came in at $11 billion, whereas its free cash flow for the year stood at $9.5 billion. It remained committed to its shareholder return as it distributed over $7.6 billion to investors in dividends during the year.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q4 2022. Overall, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, worth $28.8 billion collectively.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American medical device and healthcare company that provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. Recently, the company announced the FDA approval for its blood-based laboratory test for traumatic brain injury. This lab test will give results in 18 minutes and is the first commercially available laboratory test in the US.On February 17, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based renewable energy company that mainly specializes in energy infrastructure.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Among these hedge funds, Fundsmith LLP was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure.

That was a currency-adjusted increase of 44% from a year earlier.Sanofi reports combined global Dupixent sales from its alliance with Regeneron.The companies said that full efficacy and safety results would be presented later.Overall rates of adverse events were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo.Sanofi shares have been battered following disappointing trial results in August 2022 of a once-promising breast cancer drug candidate.Legal claims that heartburn drug Zantac caused cancer have also weighed on the stock.The group, led by British CEO Paul Hudson, this monthstrucka deal to acquire Provention Bio Inc for $2.9 billion to bolster its work on a U.S.-approved type 1 diabetes therapy.Analysts have said that this year's expected market debut of two new products, to balance out reliance on Dupixent, would be important tests of the company's marketing and development prowess and a chance to regain investor confidence.These products are haemophilia A treatment Altuviiio, requiring fewer injections than standard therapy, and Beyfortus from a partnership with AstraZeneca, which is a preventive injection against the common RSV airways infection in infants.Sanofi and Regeneron on Tuesday announced the European Commission had approved Dupixent to treat severe atopic dermatitis in young children.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms) over 52 weeks, while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function, quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity, with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “In this landmark Phase 3 trial, patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients, advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”Story continuesCOPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, but can also lead to anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone, approximately 300,000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.“Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD, but unfortunately, many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program, shaving years off standard clinical development timelines,” said Dietmar Berger, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Global R&amp;D ad interim at Sanofi and Chief Medical Officer. “We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results, which may give new hope to patients, caregivers and physicians.”In the BOREAS trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials), 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005), the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p&lt;0.0001), with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003), both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy, including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent, 6.8% placebo), diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent, 3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent, 3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo, 7.9% Dupixent), hypertension (6.0% placebo, 3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo, 4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo, 1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation, as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; the proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at 52 weeks; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom score.The second, replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs, four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 600,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

REGN announced that the FDA has approved a label extension for the cholesterol drug Evkeeza.The drug has now been approved as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies to treat children aged 5 to 11 with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).It was initially approved as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies in those aged 12 years and older with HoFH in February 2021.HoFH, a severe form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is an extremely-rare inherited condition that affects approximately 1,300 people in the United States.48% reduction in LDL-C from baseline at week 24 when Evkeeza was added to other lipid-lowering therapies in a phase III study.The three-part, single-arm, open-label trial evaluated Evkeeza added to other lipid-lowering therapies in pediatric patients with HoFH aged 5 to 11 years. Part A (n=6) was a phase Ib study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of Evkeeza. Part B (n=14) evaluated the efficacy of Evkeeza during a 24-week treatment period and enrolled patients with an average age of 9 years. Among them, 86% were on statins, 93% were on ezetimibe, 50% were on LDL apheresis and 14% were on lomitapide. Patients received Evkeeza 15 mg/kg every four weeks delivered intravenously alongside their lipid-lowering treatment regimen. The primary endpoint was a change in LDL-C at week 24. Secondary endpoints included the effect of Evkeeza on other lipid parameters (i.e., apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein [a] and total cholesterol), efficacy by mutation status, safety and tolerability, immunogenicity and PK.The FDA evaluated the supplemental biologics license for Evkeeza in this indication under Priority Review.Label expansion of the drug will boost sales.Regeneron’s shares have gained 13.7% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 14.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea (aflibercept) sales declined as Dupixent maintained its stellar performance with progress on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Story continuesEylea sales were negatively impacted by a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab), a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of 2022 of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance and an increase in sales-related deductions.While management believes that it has substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter, it continues to expect competitive pressures for Eylea.Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY.

It causes elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and types of premature cardiovascular diseases.Lipid-lowering therapies are the most commonly used drugs for high levels of LDL cholesterol, sometimes called the 'bad' cholesterol.The expanded approval makes Regeneron's Evkeeza the first drug to treat kids under 10 with the condition.The drugmaker estimates there are roughly 200 pediatric patients suffering from HoFH in the United States.The list price of the drug varies by patient weight and is expected to be roughly $450,000 per year on average, Regeneron said in 2021.The company recorded $48 million in sales of Evkeeza in the United States in 2022.Regeneron's patient support program offers financial assistance to eligible patients who need help with out-of-pocket cost for Evkeeza.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.20bUS$6.38bUS$6.75bUS$7.34bUS$7.20bUS$7.16bUS$7.17bUS$7.22bUS$7.31bUS$7.41bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -0.62%Est @ 0.19%Est @ 0.75%Est @ 1.15%Est @ 1.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.3kUS$5.3kUS$4.8kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.5kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$45bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$118bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$118b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$52bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$98b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$186, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.082. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

These resources are made possible through a grant from Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.The pandemic has had wide-ranging and lingering effects on children's health, causing many to miss routine and preventive healthcare check-ups. Preventive health care for children is critical to address physical, mental, and emotional conditions and is essential for providing routine vaccinations, tracking developmental milestones, treating identified health concerns, and providing support to families.These new bilingual resources, available in English and Spanish, are designed to connect and support parents, caregivers, and healthcare providers as partners in children's healthcare by promoting whole child well-being, focusing on forming a healthy team, and building on families' strengths. Each family has their own unique strengths, and many of those strengths are related to their culture. The resources include:""I'm Listening,"" a new video featuring Rosita and her abuela (grandmother) visiting their pediatrician for Rosita's 5-year-old well visit. This fun and engaging video reminds us that well-child visits are a great time to communicate. Good communication among family, healthcare providers, and children leads to trusting relationships and inspires healthy habits. Rosita also talks about dancing with her extended family at parties and falling asleep to her Abuela's lullabies; a helpful reminder that families culture and traditions play an important role in wellness too.Elmo and Abby's Check-up Play Date, an interactive role-playing game where Elmo and Abby pretend they're doctors! Make-believe play builds a variety of helpful skills. Children can ""act out"" familiar scenes and work through their emotions. When they're playing the doctor, children feel more in control and less nervous about the unknown.""Hooray for Healthy Teams!"" is a digital storybook for parents and caregivers to read together with children about their ""healthy team""-parents, extended family, caregivers, teachers, doctors, nurses, and themselves. In this storybook, Wes and his dad Elijah talk about Wes's healthy team-the important people who help keep his body and brain healthy, strong, and safe.A printable activity book for caregivers and children to prepare for doctor visits, with tips for before, during, and after a visit and activities and games to help children feel comfortable and calm. Also available are printable guides to help prepare for, and make the most of, children's well-visits and printable posters for healthcare providers.Story continues""We're proud to work with Quest in creating resources that empower our ‘healthy teams' with a common language that highlights the unique strengths of families and communities,"" said Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop's Senior Vice President of U.S. Social Impact. ""Completing that circle of care, especially for those most marginalized communities, is essential to ensure our young ones are on track to grow and thrive.""Quest has teamed up with Sesame Workshop as part of Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), a multi-year initiative formed with its Quest Diagnostics Foundation, which is focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, educational programs and funding to support initiatives working to close the gap in healthcare disparities in underserved communities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.""Teaming up with Sesame Workshop to support these resources will ensure children everywhere have access to health resources that they can understand,"" said Michael Floyd, Senior Director and leader of Quest for Health Equity. ""Supporting underserved communities is integral to our mission at Q4HE, and Sesame Workshop's work to address the health and wellness needs of children in these communities is something we are both inspired by and humbled to be part of.""The new resources will be available in English at sesame.org/healthyteam and in Spanish at sesame.org/equipodesalud and are being implemented with national partners-the Council on Black Health, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, National Association of Community Health Centers, and The Center for Indigenous Health.Additionally, they are being distributed through the Sesame Street in Communities program, an initiative for community providers who serve families and help children face challenges big and small.

(PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)Quest Advanced® Specialized Transplant Services features a comprehensive menu of over 170 specialized transplant and infectious disease tests, longitudinal trends analysis of test results in the physician's electronic medical record (EMR), and round-the-clock support services that include medical consultation to ensure appropriate test selection and results interpretation affecting care.The specialized services are available to recipients and living donors across the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), broadening access for candidates for transplant and their donors. While living donors and recipients commonly travel long distances for transplant surgery at a specialized center, access to specialized pre- and post-testing and results reporting may be absent in their local community, potentially impeding living donation and a successful long-term outcome for recipients.To address these limitations, the new services expand on Quest's prior offering in transplant testing with new capabilities, including:New patient-customized information packets to help educate patients on the process and help Quest's phlebotomists fast-track testing--for results within 8-24 hours for some tests--for patients visiting one of Quest's 2,100 patient service centers.The option for at-home specimen collection from one of 5,000 mobile phlebotomists through ExamOne, a Quest Diagnostics company, for both transplant recipients and living donors.Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) Renal Risk Variant Genotyping, an advanced genetic test to help evaluate kidney disease risk for donors.Longitudinal tracking of viral loads test results according to specimen type within the EMR.Story continues""Access to fast and convenient transplant testing services is so vital for these vulnerable patient populations,"" said Elizabeth A. Cohen, PharmD, BCPS, Clinical Pharmacist and Manager of Transplant Quality, Compliance &amp; Research at Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Conn., which has piloted the Quest offering. ""Creating a better transplant testing journey means that we can meet the patients where they are and show that we are invested in their care. Given the barriers to testing we know some patients experience, working with Quest has expanded access through its national scale and improved the level of care we have been able to provide, to help us serve that mission.""Organ and tissue transplantation requires a battery of tests to identify infectious diseases in donors and recipients, determine match compatibility, such as through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, monitor transplant therapy response and identify rejection. As certain transplant therapies may suppress the immune system, testing is also crucial to identify pathogens to help prevent transmission from a donor. Transplant recipients can undergo as many as 500 tests over the course of their lifetime, while living donors may also receive several tests before and after a donation.Enabling the Growth of Living DonationIn 2021, over 6,500 transplants were performed in 2021 from living donors – an increase of 14.2 percent over 2020.1 Medical advances and less restrictive medical guidelines have opened opportunities for more individuals, including those diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV, to act as living donors (for transplant recipients already infected).Transplants from living donors versus cadavers are associated with more favorable outcomes, including lower risk of complications and shorter hospital stays post-surgery, and associated cost savings.""Our transplant solutions draw from Quest's differentiated strengths in advanced diagnostics, specialized service and nationwide patient access to address a pressing clinical need for accessible, expert testing in the growing field of transplantation,"" said Karthik Kuppusamy, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Solutions, Quest Diagnostics. ""In collaboration with Quest, transplant centers, hospital health systems and other providers can ensure living donors, recipients and care teams can access the advanced and personalized transplant diagnostics they need, even if the center performing the transplant surgery is many miles away. With greater access, more people can come together to potentially save lives.""A record-breaking 41,000+ transplants were performed nationwide in 2021, more than doubling the rate from 25 years ago.2For more information, please visit Quest Advanced® Specialized Transplant Services.About Quest DiagnosticsQuest Diagnostics empowers people to take action to improve health outcomes.

These panels give consumers a deeper look into their health, helping to prepare them for meaningful discussions with their healthcare providers.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo.

While the U.S. administration declared the COVID-19 public health emergency is soon set to end, according to the Centers for Diseases Control (CDC), nearly 1 in 5 American adults who had COVID-19 still suffer adverse side effects, otherwise known as long COVID-19, leading to a secondary health crisis. As we continue to learn about the long-term impacts of COVID-19, Quest is committed to innovating testing capabilities to provide much needed information to the consumer.""Millions of COVID-19 survivors have been seeking further insight into their persistent symptoms that just won't go away,"" said Richard Adams, Vice President and General Manager of Consumer-Initiated Testing at Quest. ""The best way to assess what's happening inside your body is through a trusted laboratory test that offers actionable insights.""Long COVID-19 side effects, which are still relatively new to researchers, can occur for four or more weeks post-infection. These symptoms include heart palpitations, fatigue, hair loss, chest pain, joint pain, and brain fog. More so, according to the CDC, nearly 80% of people who experience long COVID-19 say they have limitations during their day-to-day activities.The Post-COVID-19 Basic Panel collects Data for:C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test to measure the amount of CRP in your blood, a protein produced by the liver and is a marker of inflammation.Thyroid function Test to indicate abnormal thyroid function, which is a potential parallel to long COVID.Vitamin B12 levels as many symptoms of long COVID are the same as those with a vitamin B12 deficiency.Vitamin D levels since many health conditions that put you at high risk for severe COVID symptoms and complications are also related to vitamin D deficiencies.Urinalysis to identify lower urinary tract symptoms and kidney injury caused by inflammation from a severe COVID-19 infection.Story continuesIn addition to the above analytes, the Post COVID-19 Expanded Test Panel includes:Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) and Hepatic Function Panel are comprehensive screening tools that assess over 15 different substances to evaluate glucose levels, kidney function, liver function, electrolyte, and fluid imbalance, and more.Complete Blood Count (CBC) to measure 15 components of your blood to help identify bleeding disorders or infections and to evaluate abnormal levels of specific blood components. Red blood cells and T cells could be impacted due to a previous COVID-19 infection, and the CBC can detect COVID-19-related blood abnormalities.Ferritin levels correlate to the body's iron status. Low ferritin levels may indicate an iron deficiency, while high ferritin levels could indicate signs of disease.""These two post-COVID-19 panels will empower consumers with the data they need to find the best recovery path and ease long COVID-19 symptoms.  Further, they will help ignite conversations among researchers and healthcare providers to understand COVID-19 side effects better,"" according to Yuri Fesko, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs, Quest.Quest's consumer-initiated test service allows people access to the same quality tests used by doctors and hospitals, providing the information and insights they need about their health.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.99 a share.DGX has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97.DGX is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Centene (CNC) as well.Centene, which is readying to report earnings on April 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

During the last reported quarter, the base business registered growth. The company has also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In advanced diagnostics, it generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services and also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test.In addition, to help offset inflationary pressures, it has continued to pursue its operational excellence strategy and has been closely managing the cost structure through the company’s invigorate initiatives.However, in the fourth quarter, COVID-19 testing revenues plunged 74.6%.

For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter.Share PriceIn the past year, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry.

(NYSE:AMP) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Ameriprise FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, for US$18m worth of shares, at about US$315 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$288. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Ameriprise Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Ameriprise Financial insiders own about US$120m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Ameriprise Financial Tell Us?Insiders sold Ameriprise Financial shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.""Cisco's purpose is to Power an Inclusive Future for All, and we realize that gender equity is crucial in meeting this goal. That's why we asked women leaders from Cisco Social Innovation Investments (SII) partners, ""How are you increasing equity through your work?"" and this is what they had to say.Olasimbo Sojinrin, COO of Solar SisterOlasimbo Sojinrin, the COO of Solar Sister, is passionate about using renewable energy to empower women entrepreneurs in rural Africa. She believes that the work of Solar Sister is not only about promoting equality, but also increasing equity.""Equality means treating everyone the same, while equity means giving everyone what they need to succeed. Solar Sister is increasing equity by providing women with the tools and resources they need to thrive in the clean energy sector.""Every woman's life and needs are different; therefore, we tailor our training and business strategy to accommodate these differences. Solar Sister encourages diversity and leaves no woman behind by giving them the tools to modify the model to their specific needs.In addition to addressing energy poverty, Solar Sister's approach advances gender equity. By meeting women where they are, Solar Sister is challenging conventional gender roles and increasing women's economic independence, promoting them as business owners, and allowing them to generate income.Story continuesThis approach not only helps women entrepreneurs succeed, but also has a ripple effect on their families and communities. ""When women have access to clean energy, they can save money on fuel and invest in their businesses and their families,"" she explains. ""This creates a more sustainable, equitable future for all.""Solar Sister is increasing equity by addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by women in rural Africa and empowering them with the resources they need to succeed in the clean energy sector.Chandra Roxanne, Managing Director, Astia EdgeChandra Roxanne joined Astia's Investment team a year ago as Managing Director of Astia Edge.""Equality levels the playing field by removing the barriers to access. Equity, however, is focused on repair; it is two-fold. First, equity acknowledges the gaps in access created by chronic inequality that remain when the barriers are removed.Second, equity bridges the gap. Since Astia discovered racial bias towards Black women, as well as Latina, founders in its investment decision-making process, we acknowledged the gaps and our role in creating it in our paper, Astia Edge: Our Failure to Invest in Black Founders and What We Have Done About It.Following our acknowledgment, we embarked upon repairing the gap in access to funding, relative to Astia, by launching the Astia Edge Fund. This fund will invest in high-performing seed-stage companies founded and led by Black women and Latinas.Beyond offering bespoke access to our network, we position said companies to achieve great returns by right-sizing the seed-stage check. Through a right-sized check we aim to address perpetual undercapitalization and underfunding which stifles the ability of said companies to compete and scale.To truly move the needle, equality must work in tandem with equity. And In truth, the work of increasing equity is humbling, requiring courage and intentionality.""Nathalie Laidler-Kylander, President and CEO of Trickle Up""Trickle Up's mission is to partner with women in extreme poverty to build economic opportunity and drive inclusion. The amazing women we have the privilege of working with in Asia, Latin America, and Africa are forging resilient pathways out of poverty and increasing their confidence and agency, buoyed by the solidarity they find in women's savings groups.In rural communities experiencing extreme poverty, women are often marginalized, lacking rights, opportunities, and voice. But women are agents of change. We support an enabling environment through training, mentorship, seed capital, and the formation of all-women savings groups so women can create their own economic empowerment.We increase equity by accompanying participants on their journeys to become micro-entrepreneurs and community leaders, and even run for political office.Equity is about having the tools you need to succeed, working in solidarity to change not only cultural and normative barriers holding all women back but celebrating an individual's belief in herself.One day, we'll live in a world where equality in opportunity, regardless of gender, race, and background, exists. Until then, we must invest in equity by providing inclusive opportunities for the economic, social, and political empowerment of women, resulting in the equality we seek.""Anushka Ratnayake, Founder and CEO, myAgro""myAgro helps small-scale farmers generate more wealth from their farms by closing the equity gap: farmers in the west have easy access to data, technology, and technical expertise but farmers in Africa do not. Our layaway model makes it affordable for farmers to access the modern techniques and supports-seeds, insurance, fertilizer-to double their harvests and increase their incomes by 50 percent. We use data and technology to lower the cost of serving farmers, making access to information more equitable for farmers living in rural and remote areas of Africa.We recognize equality is not the same as equity. Women do the majority of farming in Africa, but they get less than a third of the support! In order to close this gap, we take an extra step to design specifically for women like Awa in Mali [pictured in the photo at the top of this blog]. She plants food crops her family eats - like peanuts and okra instead of cash crops like the men in her village who plant maize and cotton. We make it easy for Awa, who earns small amounts of money by selling goods in her village, to make a payment of as little as $1 at a time towards her peanut and vegetable farms. And the results are amazing! Awa has transformed her life over the 5 years she's been with myAgro-she's eating 3 meals a day thanks to her bigger harvest, and with her profits, she reconstructed her house to be safer for her kids. She dreamt of owning a store, and now with her profits, she has built a small store next to her house to earn income year-round.When solutions are designed with women in mind, female farmers like Awa can overcome the extra barriers they face to succeed in a male-dominated space.""Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, CEO, Mercy Corps""Mercy Corps exists to alleviate suffering, poverty, and oppression by helping people build secure, productive, and just communities. We support communities-and the most marginalized within them-to emerge from crisis and build towards a more inclusive, resilient future.Women play an essential role in creating stability, driving progress, and achieving long-term development goals and investing in them is key to accelerating sustainable development.When we think about supporting women and girls globally, the real problem isn't women-their capacity or their confidence-but rather the systems that have been designed to exclude them. Equality is the end goal-a state of balanced power relations that gives equal rights, responsibilities, opportunities, and decision-making authority to all people-and gender equity is the process to get there, recognizing that all people do not have the same starting point. It's the fair treatment of all people according to their respective needs.Through our operations, culture, and programming, we strive to eliminate inequitable power dynamics, address the systems that perpetuate discrimination and abuse of power, and foster a culture of equity, integrity, and accountability.""Erin Davis, COO and Co-Founder, Enduring PlanetEnduring Planet is a Portland, Oregon-based fintech lending platform providing founder-friendly growth financing for climate tech startups.A Cisco Foundation Climate Impact Portfolio investee, Enduring Planet invests broadly across small and midsized businesses (SMBs) and startups in the United States tackling the climate crisis, providing these companies with revenue-based financing and grant advances.This can include teams working to reduce emissions, remove carbon from the atmosphere, or support greater resilience and adaptation to the impacts of climate change.""At Enduring Planet, a woman-led company, we bake equity into every aspect of our company and how we fund climate entrepreneurs. From the core structure of our products to our marketing strategy to our screening, funding, and ongoing monitoring processes, we go beyond reducing bias to actively and consciously rewarding inclusivity among teams, their leadership, and their mission. Roughly 80 percent of our investments have gone to startups with an underrepresented founder, a diverse team, or companies serving marginalized communities.We understand the challenges that entrepreneurs face and aim to be true partners in their growth, fundraising, and development; offering fast, flexible financing is just one way we can help them.""Heejae Lim, Founder and CEO, Talking Points""At TalkingPoints, we believe in the untapped potential of families to support their child's learning.Embedded in our work is a relentless focus on removing systemic barriers such as language or capacity that often prevent educators and families-particularly those from underserved communities-from engaging with one another.Equal access for families to information about their children is the first step.Equity is when the information is understandable, contextualized, and culturally sensitive so that they are able to develop meaningful relationships with their child's teachers.We want every teacher to start off the school year by asking families about their child: what their hopes and dreams are for their child, and how they can partner, together, in achieving the academic and other goals both parties want to see.Families are the biggest wealth of information about their children, and student learning can really accelerate when schools see families as part of the learning team.""Dr. Sandra S.

(CSCO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-trending-130001620.html,1679490001,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share, indicating a change of +11.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.76 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $56.54 billion and $58.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.7% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.18%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yet today, about half of the world's population remains unconnected.Powering an Inclusive Future for All means addressing the barriers that keep people from accessing the Internet, including cost, skills gaps, and lack of networking infrastructure. But access is just the beginning. Once people are connected to the Internet, we want to create an experience that helps meet their needs. We are making improvements across our product portfolio to help ensure more people are not only connected, but also have trust in digital solutions with product features that set them up for success.Our impact: Unlocking the value of digitizationSince 2015, Cisco has collaborated with government leaders, industry, and academia to support the delivery of national digital agendas through the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program. Over the last two years the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies; however, it has also highlighted the stark digital divide that exists across society and within different socioeconomic groups. Through CDA, we are supporting countries to embrace digital and deliver connected and inclusive societies. To date, CDA has over 1100 active or completed projects in 44 countries.For example:In South Africa, we are expanding Cisco Experience, Design, Go-to-Market, Earn (EDGE) Centers. EDGE Centers function as incubators for business knowledge, speed up entry to market, and ultimately create new jobs for the local economy. They provide small- and medium-sized businesses with state-of-the-art Cisco communication and collaboration technology, as well as training and enablement programs to support the growth of local businesses.Despite strong privacy and cybercrime laws, Italy is one of the world's top targets of cyber attacks. Cisco established a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity co-innovation center in Milan. The center will promote research and innovation, train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, and create a local innovation ecosystem.In Switzerland, the region of Jura is making e-government services accessible to citizens, particularly those who have never used e-services before or can't easily access them from home. Cisco has partnered with local leaders to deploy two interactive kiosks in the town of Porrentruy to help ensure all citizens have access to the services they need.Citizens in remote and rural regions in Mexico have limited access to specialist medical consultants. Cisco partnered with Médica Sur, a private healthcare group, to pilot ""Doctor in a Box,"" a mobile medical kit that can be deployed in isolated parts of the country. By making digital patient services mobile, we have expanded the medical coverage of one of Mexico's most advanced hospitals.Story continuesInclusion by design in Cisco productsAs a collaboration platform, Webex offers multiple ways for people to connect. We continue to invest in and develop more inclusive features for this portfolio of products. For example, Webex Control Hub, which provides real-time analytics for all Webex services, uses a color palette that provides accessibility for colorblind users. High-contrast features in the Webex app and meeting platform make work easier for low-vision users. Real-time closed captioning and translation into over 100 languages during meetings helps those with language or auditory barriers, leading to greater participation and retention, especially when Webex is used for remote learning.Bringing connectivity to communitiesToday, broadband infrastructure has been installed across most of the United States. But even in places where broadband exists, there are regions where large portions of the population experience the digital divide. These ""broadband deserts"" are home to 82% of the country's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).Lack of connectivity has implications for people's ability to seek education and employment, access healthcare, and connect with others. To address this disparity-and as part of our Social Justice Action 8: Commit to HCBUs, Cisco is installing broadband service on the campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina. The installation's location makes for an outsize benefit. Not only is South Carolina one of the states with the highest number of households without broadband access, Claflin is located right next to South Carolina State University, another HBCU. The new equipment will provide connectivity to both universities and will extend nearly two miles into the surrounding community.Once complete, this pilot may serve as a model for other HBCUs that do not have access to government funding. Cisco is fully funding the Claflin installation, and the Student Freedom Initiative is providing support to extend this work to other colleges and universities. This work is just one aspect of Cisco's efforts to support HBCUs and the AA/B community as a whole.Scott McGregor, Lead, Cisco Social Justice Action 8, shared, ""Throughout their history, HBCUs have been not only a source of education, but also a pillar of their communities. Providing connectivity is a way that they can continue to play this role.""To learn more about the progress we're making to power a more inclusive future, visit our Cisco ESG Reporting Hub, where you can read our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, March 21, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/744945/Digital-Inclusion-How-Cisco-Is-Bringing-Connectivity-to-Communities]"

The index has been developed against the backdrop of a post-COVID, hybrid world, where users and data must be secured wherever work gets done. The report highlights where businesses are doing well and where cybersecurity readiness gaps will widen if global business and security leaders don’t take action.Organizations have moved from an operating model that was largely static – where people operated from single devices from one location, connecting to a static network – to a hybrid world in which they increasingly operate from multiple devices in multiple locations, connect to multiple networks, access applications in the cloud and on the go, and generate enormous amount of data. This presents new and unique cybersecurity challenges for companies.Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index: Resilience in a Hybrid WorldThe Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index: Resilience in a Hybrid World measures the readiness of companies to maintain cybersecurity resilience against modern threats. These measures cover five core pillars that form the baseline of required defences: identity, devices, network, application workloads, and data, and encompasses 19 different solutions within the pillars.Story continuesConducted by an independent third-party, the double-blind survey asked 6,700 private sector cybersecurity leaders across 27 markets to indicate which of these solutions they had deployed and the stage of deployment. Companies were then classified into four stages of increasing readiness: Beginner, Formative, Progressive and Mature.FindingsAlongside the stark finding that only 9% of Canadian organizations are at the Mature stage, 57% of organizations fall into the Beginner (9%) or Formative (48%) stages – meaning that their cybersecurity readiness is below average. Only 15% of companies globally are at a Mature stage.This readiness gap is telling, not least because 77% of respondents said they expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business in the next 12 to 24 months. The cost of being unprepared can be substantial, as 51% of respondents said they had a cybersecurity incident in the last 12 months and 34% of those affected said it cost them at least US $500,000.“The move to a hybrid world has fundamentally changed the landscape for companies and created even greater cybersecurity complexity. Organizations must stop approaching defence with a mix of point tools and instead, consider integrated platforms to achieve security resilience while reducing complexity,” said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. “Only then will businesses be able to close the cybersecurity readiness gap.”Business leaders must establish a baseline of ‘readiness’ across the five security pillars to build secure and resilient organizations. This need is especially critical given that 78% of the respondents plan to increase their security budgets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. By establishing a base, organizations can build on their strengths and prioritize the areas where they need more maturity and improve their resilience.“Canadian organizations are falling behind their global peers on cybersecurity readiness, leaving them vulnerable to threats that continue to grow and evolve,” said Robert Barton, Chief Technology Officer, Cisco Canada. “The gap is only going to widen if Canadian businesses don’t act quickly. Organizations need to take significant and meaningful steps to increase their cybersecurity readiness and improve their resilience against the emerging threat landscape.”Readiness across the five key pillarsIdentity: Progress is needed here as only 15% of organizations are ranked MatureDevices: This has the highest percentage of companies in the Mature stage at 33%Network Security: Companies are lagging on this front with 64% of organizations in the Beginner or Formative stagesApplication Workloads: This is the pillar where companies are the least prepared, with 73% of organizations in the Beginner or Formative stagesData: This has the second-highest number of companies in the Mature stage (17%)Additional Resources:Report: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/products/security/cybersecurity-reports/cybersecurity-readiness-index/2023/cybersecurity-readiness-index-report.pdfMicrosite: https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/products/security/cybersecurity-reports/cybersecurity-readiness-index.htmlAbout Cisco Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.
