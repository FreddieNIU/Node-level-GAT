Here’s what you need to know about such transitions.When Charles Schwab first announced its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, it generated a flurry of calls from clients concerned about how the change would affect them. Now that the transition is just around the corner, those questions take on more urgency, but the anxiousness has largely dissipated.Being Rich vs. Being Wealthy: What’s the Difference?While the answers we’ve given our clients apply specifically to the Schwab/TD Ameritrade merger, they also apply in general to just about any ownership changes among financial institutions.Anytime brokerages merge, clients become understandably anxious. Some of our clients have had accounts with TD Ameritrade for decades. One of the biggest questions they have is, “What will happen to my hard-earned investments?”To the relief of many, nothing will change from an investment perspective when the transition occurs over Labor Day weekend. If you own a specific asset now, you will still own it on Sept. 5, after the transition is complete. Any accounts you have with TD Ameritrade will automatically move to Schwab that weekend. All assets will transfer “in-kind,” which means nothing will be sold or repurchased, and thus no tax implications will be generated by the acquisition to worry about.However, there are some things you should be aware of as the transition process moves forward.What do I need to do to transfer my assets?The short answer is nothing. Your account will transition to a Schwab account with no further input from you. If you currently have a TD Ameritrade account, you will receive what’s called a “negative consent” letter announcing the change. Negative consent simply means that if you have no objections to your account being brought under the Schwab umbrella, you don’t have to do anything. Your lack of response will be taken as your consent to the change.Story continuesIt is important to note your new account number, particularly if you have automatic bill pay set up through the acquired firm. Auto-payment systems will stop functioning once the transition is complete, so you will need to update them with your new account information.You should also create a portal account with the new firm so you can log in and manage your investments, as you do with your current one.What will transfer to the new brokerage?All of the accounts currently with TD Ameritrade will transfer to Charles Schwab. A specific subset of data will also move over: trade information dating back two years, seven years' worth of tax documentation, 10 years of 1099 data and four years of account history. If you feel you need more than that, contact your financial adviser; they have the ability to make special requests for more thorough records.Why Are You Still Working?Will my tax preparation change?While it won’t impact the taxes you owe, you will technically have two financial custodians for the 2023 tax year. This means you will receive two year-end statements and two 1099s, one each from the acquiring and the acquired custodian. Make sure your tax preparer knows to watch for those tax forms from both custodians.What if I don’t want to patronize the new custodian?Change is always a little nerve-racking. When you’ve been with a single custodian for years, if not decades, you become used to their communication methods, statement formats and procedures. Plus, it’s annoying to have to memorize a new account number!In this instance, we’ve found most people are largely excited about the change. Based on our evaluation of the acquiring company’s resources and practices, we’ve been advising our clients to make the move to Charles Schwab when TD Ameritrade’s platform sunsets.If, however, you find yourself holding accounts in an acquired institution that you don’t want transferred to the acquiring one, your financial adviser can help you. Though it is the largest brokerage in the U.S., Charles Schwab is not the only one, and many advisers have relationships with other institutions. They can help you move your investments to the custodian of your choice.As with any matter of finance that causes concern, your first step should be to contact your financial adviser. Whether it’s a problem your financial planner can help you solve, or simply nerves they can help calm, one of our most important roles is to ease your worries with regard to your finances.How to Pick the Best Robo Adviser for YouAs financial professionals often tell their clients, it’s better to hear from you now, before the transition is finalized, than afterward, when simple nervousness becomes full-blown anxiety.]"

Credit: Adobe Stock/stokketeAs artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, many Americans fear the technology will someday take their jobs. Financial advisors, however, may not need to worry — at least not yet.That's the impression left by a new study from Charles Schwab, the Texas-based financial services giant. The results paint a mixed picture: After surveying 1,000 401(k) participants across the country, Schwab found that almost half — 49% — of workers felt comfortable getting financial advice from an AI bot.On the other hand, very few workers actually did so. However comfortable they felt about it, only 4% of respondents actually adopted the advice of a bot.Instead, clients clearly preferred the human touch. While 74% of workers said they were likely to accept computer-generated advice, almost all of them — 95% — said they would follow advice from a human professional.""Schwab and many of the advisors we serve are exploring the potential benefits that generative AI can deliver and are seeing some of the benefits it can provide,"" a Schwab spokesperson said in an email. ""We firmly believe GAI will not replace the role of humans in wealth management or the deep, personal relationships advisors can offer clients.""This preference has also shown up in other studies. Yahoo Finance and the market research company Ipsos, for example, found that only 20% of investors were likely to use an AI financial advisor, while 63% did not trust them. The top concern of these respondents was the lack of a ""human"" element in the advice.The bots polled a little better on the personal finance website Annuity.org, which found that 29% of Americans trusted AI for investment advice. But when asked in more detail, their confidence plunged — only 9% would prefer a bot's advice over a human's for managing portfolio risk, and just 12% said the same for building their long-term wealth or providing stock tips.So should financial advisors feel threatened?Story continues""Not yet,"" said Mark Wilson, a certified financial planner and the founder of Mile Wealth in Irvine, California. ""None of my clients have mentioned these tools to me.""Many wealth managers feel that the ""human"" element of their work is not just an advantage, but central to what they do.""AI will not replace financial advisors, because I don't think it will ever be able to fully understand human emotions, and that is absolutely mandatory for a great advisor,"" said Paul Monax, founder of Agile Wealth in Littleton, Colorado. ""It is our job to understand where a person is, where they want to go, why it is important for them to get there and then — and only then — help them to build a bridge to get there … It's those middle parts of human connection that I am skeptical will ever be replicated by AI""Read more: ChatGPT: Miracle, meme or menace?Others feel not only that human advice is superior, but that AI still has some significant kinks to work out.""I think most of the people who are worrying about ChatGPT haven't used it very much,"" said Landon Tan, founder of Query Capital in Brooklyn, New York. ""It's like asking questions to a really confident person who is completely making it up half the time. … In terms of accuracy, I would put it several steps down from Googling.""On the other hand, the technology may have other roles to play in advisors' practices, short of outright replacing them. Some wealth managers have used AI to streamline their hiring processes, while others have found it useful for portfolio management. And many have used it to battle writer's block.""In its current form, AI is great at … helping to brainstorm written content, providing a templated starting point for common client questions, and so on,"" said Kevin Brady, a vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York City.Monax said lately he's been ""experimenting"" with using a bot to write work-related content. He still has to review the text and edit it at the end to make sure it ""comes across as me,"" but he still finds it helpful.""It does give me a starting point instead of a blank page,"" Monax said.Read more: Why superhuman financial advisors will survive the AI eraClients, however, may have less experience with the technology than their advisors — at least for now. Schwab's study found that only 18% of U.S. workers had used ChatGPT, while 52% had heard of it but never used it. Another 30% had simply never heard of it.So if AI really is coming for wealth managers' jobs, it's off to a slow start.""We're a long way off from technology being able to replace humans, because humans have more direct experience with human needs,"" Tan said. ""In the real world, common sense goes a long way.""]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Range Resources (NYSE:RRC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Range Resources How Fast Is Range Resources Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that Range Resources' EPS went from US$2.16 to US$7.03 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Range Resources' revenue last year was revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. We note that while EBIT margins have improved from 16% to 56%, the company has actually reported a fall in revenue by 20%. That's not a good look.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Range Resources' future EPS 100% free.Are Range Resources Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Range Resources, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$138m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Range Resources, with market caps between US$4.0b and US$12b, is around US$7.9m.The CEO of Range Resources only received US$3.3m in total compensation for the year ending December 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Range Resources To Your Watchlist?Range Resources' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Range Resources is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Range Resources (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  you should be aware of.Although Range Resources certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Sebree Solar is an innovative two-phase solar project in Henderson County, Kentucky, which will have a capacity of up to 400 megawatts of American-produced energy. The project's first phase – Sebree Solar I – is set to begin construction in Fall 2023.""Nucor's success in Kentucky has grown significantly in recent years, with major new investments and jobs helping to expand the reach of its steel products,"" said Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. ""Whether it's electric vehicles or cutting-edge metals manufacturing, Kentucky is emerging as a national leader in creating the jobs of the future. I look forward to Nucor's continued success here and am happy to welcome NextEra Energy Resources to the commonwealth for what we hope will be another long and prosperous relationship.""The steel for Sebree Solar I will be sourced from Nucor Steel Gallatin in Ghent, Kentucky. Steel from Nucor Steel Gallatin will also be used for another solar project to be built and operated by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, Green River Solar, in Meade and Breckinridge counties. The Green River Solar project will generate up to 200 megawatts of electricity. The Kentucky-produced steel will be used for the racking system which supports the projects' solar panels.""We are delighted to work with NextEra Energy Resources, and to be a key material supplier to this important addition to the power grid in Kentucky where we have grown our presence considerably in recent years,"" said Greg Murphy, Executive Vice President of Business Services and General Counsel at Nucor Corporation.  ""Our country's energy transition will be built with steel and the steel it is built with should be produced sustainably. And while Nucor is already among the world's cleanest and most sustainable steel producers, this agreement will enable us to further reduce our climate footprint and meet our goals for improvement.""Story continuesSebree Solar I is anticipated to begin commercial operation in December 2025. Over its 30-year lifespan, it will contribute approximately $20 million in additional tax revenue to Henderson County, which can be used for roads, schools, and other public services.""I applaud Nucor and NextEra Energy Resources for collaborating on this huge investment in Kentucky. This project will unleash a wave of workforce development in western Kentucky, benefiting countless families by expanding job opportunities. By collaborating with companies like Nucor and NextEra Energy Resources, Kentucky will continue to be a leader in transformative projects that strengthen our economy and establish us as a prominent force in steel manufacturing and energy production throughout North America,"" said Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers. ""As a state committed to prioritizing our residents' energy security, I appreciate the benefits of projects that are designed to generate energy that will be placed on our electric energy grid. This project is an example of two companies that are making substantial financial commitments and contributions to Kentucky by using Kentucky products made by Kentucky workers. I look forward to seeing the benefits for Kentucky residents in the years to come.""This announced PPA advances Nucor's broader sustainability strategy and complements a wind-powered PPA that Nucor entered into in 2021. Nucor has agreed to off-take a total of 350 megawatts of carbon-free electricity through these two PPAs, enough to provide sufficient power to approximately 100,000 U.S. households annually.""We are pleased to work with Nucor to help them achieve their sustainability goals. This solar energy project will generate low-cost, homegrown energy and provide millions of dollars in additional tax revenue to Henderson County over the life of the project,"" said Rebecca Kujawa, president and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources, the world's largest generator of wind and solar energy, and a world leader in battery storage. ""Constructing our project from steel made sustainably and locally will help drive economic development in Kentucky.""""This is great news for our commonwealth. The agreement between NextEra Energy Resources and Nucor brings together two great corporate citizens in what promises to be a connection that will benefit this region and the commonwealth,"" said Kentucky House Speaker David Osborne.  ""The construction of Sebree will lead to substantial orders for Nucor's Ghent facility and millions of megawatt hours of Kentucky-generated solar energy added to our electricity grid. I appreciate the leadership that made this deal possible and look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have for generations.""About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$9.8b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 44% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Unum Group. Check out our latest analysis for Unum Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Unum Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Unum Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Unum Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Unum Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Unum GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Unum Group in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$74m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Unum Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Unum Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.5 billion, which indicates a decline of 0.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.15 per share, which suggests growth of 14.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.The apparel and lifestyle products company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRalph Lauren has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. Its strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to have supported AUR growth in the fiscal first quarter.RL’s premium pricing strategy has been a key contributor to the company’s growth story. The renowned lifestyle apparel company has always managed to maintain higher prices for its clothing. Gains from the improved pricing are likely to get reflected in Ralph Lauren’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s focus on expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities via investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bodes well. Strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally is likely to have been a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter.Some other notable efforts on the online front are virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability, the introduction of additional digital sites in key markets, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition. These factors are likely to have aided the top line in the quarter under review.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is predicted to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to have been driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth, partly offset by increased product costs.We expect the first-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted operating margin to expand 10 basis points to 12.8%, while on a GAAP basis, the operating margin is likely to increase 90 bps to 12.7% for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin is expected to increase 10 bps year over year, while the GAAP gross margin is expected to expand 60 bps year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Ralph Lauren has been witnessing the negative impacts of higher compensation and variable selling expenses, which are anticipated to have partly dented margins in the fiscal first quarter. Also, unfavorable currency fluctuations are likely to have been concerning.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 150 bps in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Additionally, it anticipated the gross and operating margins to witness 50 bps of adverse currency impacts each.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Ralph Lauren this time around.

UAA is likely to report a decline in the top line from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Aug 8 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1,301 million, indicating a dip of 3.6% from the prior-year fiscal period’s reported figure.The bottom line of this developer, marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories is also expected to decrease from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading. The consensus estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter has been stable over the past 30 days. The company reported earnings of 3 cents per share in the year-ago period.This Baltimore, MD-based player has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, Under Armour’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 20%.Key Things to NoteUnder Armour’s results for the fiscal first quarter are likely to have been hurt by a tough operating landscape, including inflationary pressures and adverse currency fluctuations. The company has been witnessing weak margins due to increased promotions and an unfavorable mix, which is associated with increased distributor and footwear revenues. These limitations, coupled with any deleverage in selling, general &amp; administrative expenses and product costs, are expected to have weighed upon the company’s quarterly performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s direct-to-consumer channel is pegged at $479 million, showing a year-over-year decline of 8.1%.On its last earnings call, Under Armour expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to decline in low to mid-single-digit on a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Management had projected a gross margin decline of 75-100 basis points, as higher planned promotions continue to outpace freight tailwinds. It had envisioned a loss per share of 3-5 cents for the quarter under review. UAA anticipated inventory to be up at a high 30s percentage rate for the first quarter. Management further cited that it expects supply-chain disruptions from prior periods to continue in the first half of fiscal 2024.On the flip side, Under Armour’s focus on strengthening its brand through enhanced customer connections, effective innovations, better price points and a new loyalty program appear encouraging. UAA’s strategy to focus on improving sales through product innovation, investments in the stores and acceleration of e-commerce capabilities are likely to have been positive.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Under Armour this time around.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cintas'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cintas is:35% = US$1.3b ÷ US$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Cintas' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Cintas has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Cintas was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Cintas' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 11% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Cintas fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Cintas Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cintas has a three-year median payout ratio of 34%, which implies that it retains the remaining 66% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Cintas has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 30%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Cintas' future ROE will be 35% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Cintas' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

But despite rising interest rates and credit card debt, Americans are still spending.David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, said he saw ""encouraging"" signs in Amazon's results. North American retail operations were responsible for more than two thirds of Amazon's $4.4 billion improvement in operating income, noted Klink, whose firm holds stakes valued at about $166 million in Amazon shares, $80 million in Walmart shares and $19 million in Target shares.Yet a major question is ""whether Amazon's growth was more to do with improvements it has been making"" than a reflection of stronger consumer demand across the board, said GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.Amazon has been making efforts to speed up its same-day and one-day deliveries, introduce adjustments at its Whole Foods business such as lower prices and embedded checkout technology, as well as sharpen in-stock levels and refine the decor of its Amazon Fresh stores, executives and analysts said.The Seattle-based company forecast as much as a 13% rise in sales for the July-September period, driven by strong performance during its ""Prime Day"" event held on July 11 and 12. To be sure, Amazon's second-quarter numbers reflect higher prices and relatively low comparisons. In the same period last year, U.S. inflation was at its peak, prompting shoppers to cut back on purchases.Story continuesTarget, which reports April-June results on Aug. 16, in May forecast a grim second quarter and said it expects full-year comparable sales to either rise or fall by low-single digits. Walmart, which reports on Aug. 17, had a better-than-expected first quarter and forecast sales to be up about 3.5% for the year. But Walmart executives said they were ""uncertain"" about the back half of 2023, as goods become more expensive and people have less money to spend.Other big companies have also signaled possible choppy waters ahead. Apple, shipping group Maersk and advertising giant WPP said last week they expect less demand for iPhone shipments, global container volume and advertising spend respectively over the next few months.Amazon's performance following its Prime Day was a ""good read for discount retailers,"" however, said Joseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group.""I think that value-based retailers like Walmart and Target"" will hold up better than others, he said.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)]"

Meanwhile, its selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 1% to $587 million, helped by lower freight costs.""Under Armour is making progress,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel, adding that for better or worse, promotions would still exist across retail.Like rivals Nike and Adidas, Under Armour has seen demand for its products wane in North America, its largest market, though this has been partly offset by a strong rebound in China.The company's Asia-Pacific sales rose 14.5%, while its North American revenue fell 9.1%.The apparel retailer's inventories were up 38% year-over-year at $1.3 billion.""Under Armour hasn't necessarily tapped into the outdoor trend,"" said Jessica Ramirez, senior analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates. She added the company had gone into its ""own silo"", not engaging as many consumers as it could have.Shares of the Baltimore, Maryland-based firm dropped marginally in early trading.Still, the company reported a profit of 2 cents per share in the quarter, while analysts had expected a loss of 2 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.Quarterly revenue fell 2.4% to $1.32 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' estimate of $1.30 billion.Under Armour also reiterated its revenue and profit outlook for the fiscal year 2024.

In the last reported quarter, Under Armour’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 20%.Key Things to NoteUnder Armour’s results for the fiscal first quarter are likely to have been hurt by a tough operating landscape, including inflationary pressures and adverse currency fluctuations. The company has been witnessing weak margins due to increased promotions and an unfavorable mix, which is associated with increased distributor and footwear revenues. These limitations, coupled with any deleverage in selling, general &amp; administrative expenses and product costs, are expected to have weighed upon the company’s quarterly performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s direct-to-consumer channel is pegged at $479 million, showing a year-over-year decline of 8.1%.On its last earnings call, Under Armour expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to decline in low to mid-single-digit on a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Management had projected a gross margin decline of 75-100 basis points, as higher planned promotions continue to outpace freight tailwinds. It had envisioned a loss per share of 3-5 cents for the quarter under review. UAA anticipated inventory to be up at a high 30s percentage rate for the first quarter. Management further cited that it expects supply-chain disruptions from prior periods to continue in the first half of fiscal 2024.On the flip side, Under Armour’s focus on strengthening its brand through enhanced customer connections, effective innovations, better price points and a new loyalty program appear encouraging. UAA’s strategy to focus on improving sales through product innovation, investments in the stores and acceleration of e-commerce capabilities are likely to have been positive.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Under Armour this time around.

Price and EPS SurprisePlug Power, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePlug Power, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Plug Power, Inc. QuoteFactors to NotePlug Power’s second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from the December 2022 acquisition of the subsidiaries of Cryogenic Industrial Solutions, Alloy Custom Products and WesMor Cryogenics, which has expanded the company’s production capabilities for stainless steel and aluminum cryogenic transport truck-mounted cryogenic pressure vessels, cryogenic transport trailers, and other mobile storage containers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLUG’s second-quarter revenues indicates a 55.7% jump from the year-ago reported number.Higher sales from hydrogen site installations, liquefiers, cryogenic equipment and electrolyzer stacks and systems are expected to have boosted revenues from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other suggests a 67.2% surge from the year-ago reported figure.Expanding customer base is likely to have driven revenues from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the second quarter hints at a 26.1% jump from the year-ago reported figure.An increase in the number of sites with fuel contracts is likely to have boosted revenues from fuel delivered to customers and related equipment. The consensus mark for revenues from fuel delivered to customers and related equipment indicates a 22.7% rise from second-quarter 2022 reported figure.However, high energy prices and inflationary pressure are likely to have dented Plug Power’s second-quarter performance. Amid the tight labor market, labor shortages are expected to have resulted in higher costs for the company, thus hurting its bottom line.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Plug Power this time around.

This and continued rooms pricing power and a robust programming calendar are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased visitation (in the Las Vegas market) and robust recovery in the Macau region (owing to the easing of restrictions) are likely to have supported the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

Some have found better returns in refined products.Gasoline prices usually rise ahead of the U.S. summer driving season.This year's seasonal rally has been super-charged by a ten-week low in supplies caused in part by refinery outages in the US east and Gulf Coasts and strong exports to global markets from the United States, which typically imports from other countries to supplement its own production.Already the strength of gasoline and gasoil has helped to reverse energy funds' losses following the banking crisis stirred by the March collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to figures from Societe Generale and calculations by Reuters.Money managers in the week to Aug. 1 boosted their net long holdings of NYMEX RBOB gasoline futures to the highest since late February 2022. On a seasonal basis, this position is at a three-year high, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows.Now traders are focusing on the weather, as Atlantic waters have climbed to the highest temperatures in 120,000 years, heightening the risk of storms.Meteorologists in July increased the number of storms forecast for this year, although they have also said the combination of rising sea temperatures and the El Nino weather pattern has increased uncertainty.A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. Gulf Coast - where nearly half of US oil refining capacity is located - could damage oil refinery units, or cause refiners to temporarily shut them down until the storm passes.Refinery outages caused by plant shut-ins or damaged equipment in that region would likely increase fuel prices.Story continuesTom Kloza, founder of the Oil Price Information Service, said he multiples the category of the storm by itself and by itself again to find the minimum increase gas price a hurricane would cause.""The Gulf of Mexico may be the biggest choke point (for oil product exports) this year if we get any disturbances and I think we're all going to be on tenterhooks this hurricane season,"" he said.HEDGE FUND-FUELED TURNAROUNDGasoline futures have risen around 14% this year, compared with a roughly 2% rise for U.S. crude futures. Fuel strength pushed gasoline margins to one-year highs around $40 a barrel in July.""The gas crack has been propelled by CTA buying, as well as refinery outages in the US and because extreme heat meant lower refinery runs in Europe,"" said Vincent Elbhar, co-founder of hedge fund GZC Investment.Commodity trading advisers (CTAs) use systematically programmed algorithms to track asset performance.One of these computer-led funds, the roughly $8 billion Aspect Capital, considered gasoline futures were among the best energy asset performers in its Diversified Fund portfolio, a source said on condition of anonymity. The fund was up 4% for the year to end-June, according to Societe Generale. Aspect Capital declined to comment on the performance.Active managers also benefited.""Unleaded gasoline has been the top performing commodity within the petroleum sector year-to-date,"" said Eliot Geller, a partner at CoreCommodity Management, who declined to give detail on the performance.July performance in CoreCommodity Management’s Founders Fund rose over 8%, a Barclays note said.But now, hedge funds must decide whether to stick with these trades. To guarantee a profit, they need the rise in gasoline prices to be sustained until hurricane activity is confirmed.""Look at the rally in gasoline and heating oil cracks over the last two or three weeks and you can see, everyone is positioned for a very interesting hurricane season,"" said Brent Belote, who previously traded at JP Morgan's oil desk and now runs his own $25-million hedge fund, Cayler Capital.Cayler is up 24% this year, said a separate source with knowledge of the matter. Belote declined to comment.Belote believes other refineries could shut down due to the effects of delayed maintenance.Outages at ageing refineries hampered by a lack of capital expenditure and interest in renewable energies has underpinned gasoline prices, said a trader from the oil trading desk at Arion, a $100 million hedge fund.But for gasoline to continue its rise against the price of crude oil, there needs to be a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, they said.The El Nino weather pattern, which disperses the winds that whip up into Atlantic hurricanes, may divert storms away from the Gulf of Mexico.Hurricanes anywhere else matter much less for energy prices, the trader said.(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie, Additional reporting by Laura Sanicola in Washington; editing by Barbara Lewis)]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 98 cents to $82.92.Both contracts had fallen by $2 earlier in the session, but prices reversed course after a monthly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected gross domestic product growth to rise by 1.9% in 2023, up from 1.5% in a previous forecast. [EIA/M]The EIA also expects Brent crude oil prices to average $86 in the second half of 2023, up about $7 from the previous forecast.U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 12.76 million bpd in 2023, the report added, overtaking the last peak of 12.3 million bpd in 2019.Crude prices have been rising since June, primarily because of extended voluntary cuts to Saudi Arabia's production as well as increasing global demand, the EIA said.""We expect these factors will continue to reduce global oil inventories and put upward pressure on oil prices in the coming months,"" the EIA added.Weighing on prices on Tuesday, however, China's July oil imports were down 18.8% from the previous month to the lowest daily rate since January, but still up 17% from a year earlier.Overall, China's imports contracted by 12.4% in July, far steeper than the expected 5% drop. Exports fell by 14.5%, compared with a fall of 12.5% tipped by economists.Despite the gloomy data, some analysts were still positive on China's fuel demand outlook for August to early October.The peak season for construction and manufacturing activity starts in September and gasoline consumption should benefit from summer travel demand, said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li. Demand is expected to decrease gradually after October, he added.Story continuesLast week's decision by Saudi Arabia to extend a voluntary output cut of 1 million bpd into September, despite Brent rising above $80, suggested Riyadh might be targeting a higher price than $80, said Vivek Dhar, mining and energy commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.Still, some analysts were sceptical about how much supply the cuts were actually taking off the market, as other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries such as Libya and Venezuela have increased production, said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.""The production cuts have been far less than the announced quota cuts,"" Lipow said.U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles dropped, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. [API/S]Crude stocks rose by about 4.1 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 4, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Despite the sharp drop, profits still beat the $29.3 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.""The decrease mainly reflected the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining and chemicals margins,"" the company wrote in the release.It's a far cry from 2022, when the state-run firm enjoyed a 90% jump in net income for the second quarter following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Both contracts slid over 1% on Monday, breaking a six-day winning streak.Weak Chinese trade data weighsData released earlier Tuesday showed that China's imports and exports fell much faster than expected in July, with imports down 12.4% year-on-year, missing a forecast fall of 5%, while exports contracted 14.5%, steeper than an expected 12.5% decline.In particular, oil imports in July to China, the top crude importer, were down 18.8% on a monthly basis.Economic weakness in China has weighed on the crude markets this year, as the world’s second-largest economy was expected to rebound swiftly from its COVID restrictions, providing fuel consumption growth while many of the Western economies struggled with aggressive monetary tightening.Strong dollar, inflation uncertainty weighsStrength in the dollar, amid growing uncertainty over the path of U.S. interest rates, also weighed on the price of oilThe greenback saw increased bids this week as investors positioned themselves for a potentially stronger consumer price index inflation reading on Thursday.

Partner Beijing Dacheng Law Offices will gain full independence to serve domestic clients, Dentons said in a memo to clients.The global agency becomes the latest Western firm to resort to drastic measures to comply with sweeping restrictions on the handling and transfer of data within and beyond China that will take effect later this year. Among other things, Beijing’s new data security regime gives President Xi Jinping’s administration the power to shut down or fine companies that leak or mishandle sensitive information. Penalties include fines and suspensions.Xi’s administration has tightened control over the hoard of information produced by the nation’s companies, considered critical for steering the economy as well as future technologies such as AI. But the broad and vague nature of new regulations has spurred concerns about compliance, and the penalties for falling short. Morgan Stanley, for one, is shifting more than 200 technology developers — about a third of the tech cohort — out of mainland China after the country tightened access to troves of data stored onshore.Read more: Morgan Stanley Moves 200 Tech Experts From China on Data LawEvery business has been forced to weigh the costs of complying with cybersecurity and data security laws with the benefits of operating in the world’s No. 2 economy, said Tom Nunlist, a Shanghai-based associate director at Trivium China who focuses on tech policy.Story continues“The fact is that we will see more companies separate out their operations — maybe break partnerships — because of this,” he said. “The data security related regulations, data export security assessment stuff is extremely strict. Or at least it can be extremely strict. It’s been an absolute nightmare for everyone to deal with.”Financial institutions, automakers, electronics firms and consumer retailers are among the more active multinationals in the country. Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co., Starbucks Corp., Intel Corp., Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. are some of the largest household names with extensive Chinese operations.But banking in particular is considered one of the more sensitive sectors because of its integral economic role, and is party to valuable data on Chinese borrowers.Morgan Stanley’s remaining staff on the mainland have started to build a standalone China system to comply with local regulations. The new infrastructure, which may cost hundreds of millions of dollars, will be incompatible with its legacy global platforms as the lender overhauls its Asia strategy of handling client records.The twin moves coincide with Beijing’s growing willingness to go after foreign firms it accuses of violating local regulations. The government has imposed restrictions for instance on Micron Technology Inc., and regulators have this year launched investigations into consultancies such as Bain and Mintz.Read more: Data Rules Risk Making China ‘Digital Island,’ Companies SayDentons’s split was first reported by the Financial Times and specialist site Law.com. The law firm signed a deal in 2015 to link up with Dacheng Law Offices to create what was at the time the world’s largest legal firm. Among Dacheng’s clients were some of the largest state-owned enterprises, including PetroChina Co. and China Telecom Corp.Denton’s move was “in response to an evolving regulatory environment for Chinese law firms in China — including new mandates and requirements relating to data privacy, cybersecurity, capital control and governance,” the firm said in the memo.Dacheng will instead operate as a separate and independent legal entity under a “preferred firm” relationship with Dentons.“It will damage China’s links with the rest of the world in ways that might be difficult to perceive,” Nunlist said. “That really is going to be a cost of implementing the data security vision that China has laid out and frankly, I’m not sure that the Chinese government has fully reckoned with that reality.”--With assistance from Colum Murphy.(Updates with analyst’s commentary from the fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekPrivate Equity Firms Are Slow to Sell Holdings Amid Higher RatesOne Nassau County Has a Housing Crisis, the Other Nassau County Has a SolutionQuality Control Is a Secondhand Fashion Startup’s Key to Growth©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

41,6f918eec-63b5-3145-a132-773d42c0ae9f,CRM,2023-08-08,Tech earnings: What investors have learned so far,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-earnings-investors-learned-far-165327271.html,1691427207,VIDEO,"['AMAT', 'MRVL', 'QCOM', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'TSLA', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'CSCO', 'META', 'CRM', 'SNOW', 'NVDA', 'AVGO']","[So far, six of the ""magnificent seven"" tech companies have reported their quarterly results: Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA). Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon.Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.Video Transcript- Well, as the earnings season approached, many cast a wary eye on tech. The sector's been propping up the market. And given the unstable economic environment, investors have been using it to judge the health of the economy. And the majority of the so-called Magnificent Seven have all been able to beat Wall Street expectations. All have done well this earnings season.So let's bring in Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan to discuss more. Good to have you on the show, Daniel.DANIEL MORGAN: Hi, Rachelle.- So give us this breakdown of-- good to see you-- of how tech has been faring. Because obviously this initial rally started with tech. But where are we now when we factor in the earnings season?DANIEL MORGAN: What's interesting, Rachelle, as you mentioned in the beginning of the conversation, the bar for the tech sector coming into this second quarter was really low. But I will have to say that I was very pleased with the way that a lot of these earnings reports go. I mean, if we just kind of kick off and we look at online ad spend rates with Meta and Google a couple of weeks ago, the expectations were they would be flat to negative. And both those companies reported an increase in revenue. So Meta was up 11%, Google was up about 3.5% in their ad revenues.Story continuesAnd that kind of worked itself through the reports. Amazon kind of capped things off with a very good report with revenues up 11%. And then we had Apple, which was kind of a mixed review. We knew that smartphone unit volumes were going to be very muted going into the second quarter. But overall, their guidance that they gave for the upcoming third quarter was very strong in regards to services and iPhones.So I think overall, we'd have to take-- a takeaway from this, Rachelle, that is that numbers came in better than expected. We had a very low bar. Can we make up for these huge runs that we've had in these stocks, though? Right, Rachelle, coming into these reports. And I think that's where investors are pondering right now.- And of these Magnificent Seven, who was the most underwhelming for you? Especially when you factored in some of the guidance and the softness that we saw.DANIEL MORGAN: Microsoft was somewhat muted. Apple was somewhat muted. Those would be the two that kind of stood out at least at this point, to me, that were good numbers. They weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create like a catalyst or surprise, like we saw with Google, Meta, and let's say Amazon. So those two kind of stick in my mind.- And as we look at, of course, the chip space, NVIDIA riding high and enjoying those gains on that generative AI push that kept popping up in everybody's earnings call. But what about some of the other chipmakers? Who are you following there? And any surprises there?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, there's other stocks in that group, Rachelle, that could turn out to take some sort of not leadership role, but market share in the AI space. If you look at-- just to name a few, Marvel Technologies has their DSP chip called PAM, which is somewhat exciting. You have Broadcom, which has their Jericho3 chip. Now these are all chips that are just being rolled out that are in that same space that can compete directly against NVIDIA.We also know that Intel has their Falcon Shores chip that's going to come out next year. AMD, which reported last week, has their MI300, which is a AI chip that's being promoted as something that's going to compete directly against NVIDIA. So there are other companies in that space. We're going to be rolling into NVIDIA, Rachelle. About two weeks from now, we're going to get numbers from then mid week.But those are some of the reports that have kind of rolled in. Qualcomm has their AI 100 they reported last week also. So but that's still in an infancy stage. Rachelle, as we know, we haven't had a lot of tangible evidence that AI has actually directly impacted the financials of these companies. NVIDIA's really the only company that's actually shown tangible evidence of strength in terms of their AI chips.- And of course, a lot of these markets, these big tech names, also have a lot of exposure to China as well. And we're seeing some softness there in terms of demand. What are some of the stories that you're looking at coming out of China that you think we should be really keeping an eye on when it comes to big tech and where valuations then go from here?DANIEL MORGAN: You're right, Rachelle. I mean, Qualcomm gets about 60% of their revenues coming out of China. And China's head of the double sword, right? You have not only the impacts of them coming off of COVID lockdowns and how overall demand for, let's say, smartphones are coming. We know that when Apple reported numbers last week, their overall demand for smartphones in China was actually much stronger than people considered. It was actually positive where people thought it was negative.And then you also have this issue with regulators in terms of these back and forth of China no longer allowing certain chips that are produced by US companies to come into their country and vice versa. So China has got a lot of moving parts not only from the overall growth of their economy and demand for different electronics, but also in terms of what's going to happen from a regulatory perspective. How is that going to impact various companies?We already know there was news out a couple weeks ago about Micron. We know that NVIDIA-- those are companies that China has isolated as being not allowed to bring chips into their country, various chips that they make. So a lot of things coming out of China, a lot of things to follow.- And in terms of companies that you're going to be keeping an eye on as we continue through the thick of the earnings season, what are some of the bellwether stocks that are going to give us a better idea of how the consumer is feeling and how looking at things like business CapEx and what-- how companies are choosing to invest based on this macroeconomic environment?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, Rachelle, we have Cisco next week. So that's going to give us a good idea of what's going on in terms of CapEx, in terms of networking. The following week, we have Snowflake, we have NVIDIA. So those are some big numbers that are going to be coming out. Snowflake, as you know, is a middleware company and the data center space. They make the tools and software that allow you to pull data off of the big data centers.Obviously, NVIDIA, which we've already talked about in terms of AI. We also have Applied Materials reporting next week. They'll give us a good idea of how CapEx budgets are going in terms of companies spending on semiconductor equipment. And that gives us an idea of what the demand is in that space.So we still have a lot of big numbers coming out here. We also have Salesforce, which is a big play on the software as a service in terms of the enterprise. So we have more to go than just the so-called FAANG stocks or Magnificent Seven that have mostly reported up at this point. So we'll obviously be checking in here over the next couple of weeks on those numbers.- We appreciate you getting us up to speed on all of that and for joining us with your insights.DANIEL MORGAN: Thank you, Rachelle.- Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan. Good to see you.]"

Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $22 million, or 3%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $97 million, or 12%. The Liquibox acquisition had a favorable impact of $75 million, or 9%, and price realization had a favorable impact of $24 million, or 3%. Volumes were essentially flat with growth in our food automation solutions offset by continued food retail market declines and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions. Adjusted EBITDA of $191 million, or 21.7% of net sales, increased 14% from $168 million, or 20.8% of net sales. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the Liquibox acquisition.Second quarter net sales in Protective were $500 million, a decrease of 18% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $3 million, or less than 1%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $109 million, or 18%. Volumes decreased $115 million, or 19%, resulting from continued market pressures and destocking in the industrial and fulfillment sectors. Price realization had a favorable impact of $6 million, or 1%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 24% to $96 million, or 19.2% of net sales, as compared to $126 million, or 20.6% of net sales. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes.Reinvent SEE 2.0Reinvent SEE 2.0 provides continuity to our transformation into a world-class automated and digital packaging solutions company.

The current year results were unfavorably impacted by higher net interest expense, which increased $29 million as a result of debt related to the financing of the Liquibox transaction.Income tax expense was $45 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 32.5% in second quarter 2023. This compares to an income tax expense of $43 million in the prior year, or an effective tax rate of 27.2%. The effective tax rate increase in the second quarter 2023 as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by the impact of accruals for uncertain tax positions on lower pre-tax earnings.Second Quarter 2023 Non-U.S. GAAP SummaryNet sales decreased $12 million, or 1%, on a constant dollar basis. Volumes decreased by $117 million, or 8%, while the Liquibox acquisition had a favorable impact of $75 million, or 5%, and price realization had a favorable impact of $30 million, or 2%. By region, in constant dollars, APAC increased 6% and EMEA was essentially flat, while the Americas decreased 2%.Adjusted EBITDA was $280 million, or 20.3% of net sales, as compared to $293 million, or 20.7%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by earnings generated from Liquibox. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $2 million, or 1%, in second quarter 2023.The Adjusted Tax Rate was 26.9% in second quarter 2023, as compared to 24.7% in the prior year. The increase in the Adjusted Tax Rate in the second quarter 2023 as compared to the prior year is also impacted by the effect of accruals for uncertain tax positions on lower adjusted pre-tax earnings.Adjusted earnings per diluted share decreased to $0.80, from $1.01, primarily due to lower Adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense, partially offset by the operating income generated from Liquibox.Cash Flow and Net DebtCash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2023 was a use of $7 million, as compared to a source of $213 million during the prior year period. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the $175 million tax deposit that was made during the second quarter of 2023 related to a tentative agreement to settle a dispute with the IRS.Capital expenditures in the first six months of 2023 were $124 million, as compared to $119 million during the prior year period. Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was a use of $130 million for the first six months of 2023, as compared to a source of $94 million during the prior year period. Excluding the $175 million tax deposit, Free Cash Flow was a source of $45 million for the first six months of 2023.Dividend payments for the six months of 2023 and 2022 were $60 million.Total debt was $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2023 and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Net Debt, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $4.7 billion as of June 30, 2023, as compared to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, SEE had approximately $1.10 billion of available liquidity comprised of $285 million of cash and $811 million of available and unused under our committed credit facilities.Updated 2023 Full Year OutlookFor the full year 2023, SEE now expects net sales in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 billion, compared to the previous outlook of $5.85 to $6.10 billion. Both outlooks include a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 1%.The Company now expects full year Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.075 to $1.125 billion, compared to the previous outlook of $1.25 to $1.30 billion. Both outlooks include a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 6% and 8%, respectively, and unfavorable currency impact of less than 1% and approximately 1%, respectively.The Company forecasts full year Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95, compared to the previous outlook of $3.50 to $3.80, which is now based on approximately 145 million shares outstanding and an anticipated Adjusted Tax Rate of approximately 27% reflecting our unfavorable discrete adjustments and mix of jurisdictional income.In April, the Company made a $175 million tax deposit related to a tentative agreement to settle a dispute with the IRS. Excluding full year 2023 payments related to the IRS settlement, the Company expects Free Cash Flow in 2023 in the range of $325 to $375 million, compared to the previous outlook of $475 to $525 million, with capital expenditures expected to be in the range of $240 to $260 million. Cash tax payments, excluding those associated with the tax settlement, are expected in the range of $200 to $215 million.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Total constant dollar change is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. It is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks at our financial results to measure the core performance of our business, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to our investors.Sealed Air CorporationSegment InformationReconciliation of Net Earnings to Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA(Unaudited)Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,(In USD millions)2023202220232022Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations:Food$191.0$167.6$385.8$368.1Adjusted EBITDA Margin21.7%20.8%22.3%22.8%Protective95.9126.3176.3253.7Adjusted EBITDA Margin19.2%20.6%17.7%20.8%Corporate(6.6)(0.5)(14.5)(1.4)Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$280.3$293.4$547.6$620.4Adjusted EBITDA Margin20.3%20.7%20.1%21.9%Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,(In USD millions)2023202220232022U.S. GAAP Net earnings from continuing operations$93.9$114.4$156.8$264.0Interest expense, net68.739.5126.578.4Income tax provision45.342.779.1102.1Depreciation and amortization, net of adjustments(1)53.656.4122.5119.6Special Items:Liquibox intangible amortization7.5—12.5—Liquibox inventory step-up expense2.4—10.8—Restructuring charges0.63.5(0.6)4.0Other restructuring associated costs0.13.8(0.1)6.9Foreign currency exchange loss due to highly inflationary economies3.12.75.73.7Loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities—10.54.911.2Impairment loss on equity investments—16.1—31.6Charges related to acquisition and divestiture activity4.8(0.2)21.7(1.1)Other Special Items0.34.07.8—Pre-tax impact of Special items18.840.462.756.3Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$280.3$293.4$547.6$620.4Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA decline to comparable constant currency decline% decline - Adjusted EBITDA(4.5)%(11.7)%% currency impact(0.6)%0.2%% comparable constant currency(5.1)%(11.5)%Depreciation and amortization by segment are as follows:Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,(In USD millions)2023202220232022Food$41.0$32.8$87.7$69.3Protective20.123.647.350.3Consolidated depreciation and amortization(i)$61.1$56.4 $135.0$119.6 Liquibox intangible amortization(7.5)—(12.5)—Depreciation and amortization, net of adjustments$53.6$56.4 $122.5$119.6 Includes share-based incentive compensation of $2.2 million and $20.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $10.7 million and $28.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230808232702/en/ContactsInvestors Brian Sullivanbrian.c.sullivan@sealedair.com 704.503.8841Louise LagacheLouise.lagache@sealedair.com Media Christina Griffinchristina.griffin@sealedair.com 704.430.5742]"

We are working to ensure our global culture embraces diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). At SEE, our people matter. Diversity is a business strength and facilitates creativity and innovation, which is at the core of our strategy. We are creating a workplace where everyone belongs and can reach their full potential. We foster our diversity, equity and inclusion culture in all aspects of our operations. We are committed to valuing the contributions of all employees, providing fair treatment and equal access, and creating work environments that enable the full potential and well-being of all employees.Commitment to Pay EquityAs part of our DEI Pledge, we are committed to championing equal pay for work of equal value, which assesses equal pay for similar work based on comparable, bona-fide job-related factors such as geographic location, career tenure, and education level. In 2021, we conducted our bi-annual global compensation equity analysis to identify potential pay gaps that were not attributable to bona-fide job-related factors. Identified inequities are mitigated to close the gaps and compensation processes are evaluated for unintended bias and continuously improved to prevent future adverse impact.In addition to the compensation equity analysis, as part of our annual performance review and compensation cycle, we perform adverse impact assessments to evaluate any potential biases that may be present which impact performance evaluations and compensation awards.Our assessment showed no significant trends of pay inequity for gender or diversity groups across the organization. Based on our proactive approach and continuous improvements in pay reviews and processes, our goal is to eliminate pay inequities not attributable to bona-fide job-related factors in support of our commitment to equal pay work of equal value across our organization.Story continuesSEE's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion PledgeOur Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Pledge consists of bold but achievable goals supported by a global governance structure that drives adoption and engagement across the organization. Our 2025 Pledge is our compass point and consists of five specific objectives that prioritize certain metrics and process enablement within our strategy:Build a more inclusive culture with our employees across the globeIncrease gender diversity across employees globally to more than 30% by 2025Increase the representation of racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. workforce to above 35% by 2025Lead with a senior leadership team that reflects the cultural diversity of our global footprintChampion equal pay for work of equal value across our organizationAs of December 31, 2021, 25% of SEE's global workforce was female and 34% of SEE's U.S. workforce belonged to racial and ethnic minority groups. U.S. workforce data is reported in the company's EEO-1 report.DEI CouncilWe established a DEI Council in late 2020, which consists of 11 business leaders representing regions where SEE operates around the globe. The DEI Council is chaired by our CEO and President Ted Doheny in partnership with the company's Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.Engagement and Inclusion SurveyIn support of the company's DEI Pledge to build a more inclusive culture across the globe, SEE conducted a survey focused on engagement and inclusion which was completed by more than 14,000 employees. The survey provided feedback on topics such as trust, respect, opportunity, diversity, and inclusion. Together with HR partners, DEI Council members analyzed the survey results and developed action plans to further improve employee engagement and inclusion. The DEI Council developed a framework for DEI Courageous Conversations with employees, including a moderator guide, as well as training and other materials for each region.Courageous ConversationsThe Courageous Conversations initiative invites employees to join a discussion where they can speak honestly and candidly about their own experiences regarding inequality and social justice issues. These conversations are designed to encourage mutual learning and understanding by creating a safe space to share different perspectives and allow employees to check their assumptions and biases. The DEI Council established Courageous Conversations to aid in the development of an open and transparent culture at SEE.Gender Equity NetworkSEE's Gender Equity Network (GEN) has been in existence for more than 10 years. The purpose of GEN is to create a high-performance culture that embraces gender equity and inclusion.

46,f641809e-aa47-3876-a120-fa47d9d29057,RL,2023-08-08,Will Ralph Lauren's (RL) Pricing Actions Aid Q1 Earnings Beat?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-laurens-rl-pricing-actions-154400131.html,1691423040,STORY,"['RL', 'PVH']","[Ralph Lauren Corporation RL is expected to register bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers on Aug 10, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.5 billion, which indicates a decline of 0.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.15 per share, which suggests growth of 14.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.The apparel and lifestyle products company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRalph Lauren has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. Its strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to have supported AUR growth in the fiscal first quarter.RL’s premium pricing strategy has been a key contributor to the company’s growth story. The renowned lifestyle apparel company has always managed to maintain higher prices for its clothing. Gains from the improved pricing are likely to get reflected in Ralph Lauren’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s focus on expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities via investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bodes well. Strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally is likely to have been a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter.Some other notable efforts on the online front are virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability, the introduction of additional digital sites in key markets, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition. These factors are likely to have aided the top line in the quarter under review.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is predicted to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to have been driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth, partly offset by increased product costs.We expect the first-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted operating margin to expand 10 basis points to 12.8%, while on a GAAP basis, the operating margin is likely to increase 90 bps to 12.7% for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin is expected to increase 10 bps year over year, while the GAAP gross margin is expected to expand 60 bps year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Ralph Lauren has been witnessing the negative impacts of higher compensation and variable selling expenses, which are anticipated to have partly dented margins in the fiscal first quarter. Also, unfavorable currency fluctuations are likely to have been concerning.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 150 bps in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Additionally, it anticipated the gross and operating margins to witness 50 bps of adverse currency impacts each.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Ralph Lauren this time around.

55,cedea929-5022-460d-ba23-8063210f67fc,MSFT,2023-08-08,The AI stock bubble may be popping,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-stock-bubble-may-be-popping-184758202.html,1691434078,STORY,"['GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'AMD', 'MSFT', 'SNAP', 'META']","[The artificial intelligence-fueled rally that sent stocks soaring into the summer is hitting speed bumps as companies report second-quarter earnings.Microsoft (MSFT), considered a software leader in the space, told investors late last month that AI contributions to revenue will be gradual. AMD (AMD) said it expects the market for AI accelerators to reach more than $150 billion by 2027. But the long-term projections didn't help the stock, which fell more than 7% in the next trading session as analysts feared expectations may have grown too high.Overall, the Nasdaq Composite (AMD) is now down nearly 2% over the last two weeks, which spanned most of big tech earnings.The signs could point to the AI stock bubble popping. On Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Edward Stanley released an analysis of 70 prior bubbles over the past 100 years, including the dot-com surge and recent excitement in cryptocurrencies. The median return in three years for those bubbles is 154%. If Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 200% so far this year, and large cap tech are the proxy for how far the AI boom has gone, then it's likely ""late innings"" for the AI stock rally, Stanley wrote.""With typical 3-year returns into bubble peaks of 150%, one could argue that this rally surpasses most others,"" Stanley wrote.But Stanley believes the AI bubble of 2023 isn't the same as those other 70 bubbles. For one, measuring the rally is hard given that the AI index Morgan Stanley tracks is up just 50% this year, compared to the 200% surge in large cap tech.""Judging where we are on the run-up in market exuberance is extremely challenging,"" Stanley wrote. ""This is the case with AI today. Many investors would be forgiven for thinking AI investment funds are making new all-time highs on the back of Generative AI excitement. In fact, (they're) not. Several underlying stocks are, but as an investment theme, performance is still 14% below prior market high.""Story continuesA Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, May 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Wall Street buzz quieting downAI has been the buzzword of Wall Street in 2023. It sent strategists boosting their outlook on the S&amp;P 500. Roundhilll created a new buzzy ETF called CHAT, and investors have been searching deep into the world of tech to find the next big AI winner.Entering second-quarter earnings season, the AI promise seemed to still be fueling stock jumps. In July, a Bloomberg report about Apple working on its own form of ChatGPT sent the stock up about 1%. A day before, Microsoft shares rose about 4% as the company announced pricing for its M365 Copilot AI product. Both stocks finished at all-time highs on the day the developments broke.But when prompted to give specifics on AI projects, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook didn't bite. He called AI and machine learning ""core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build,"" without expanding too far into coming products like the ChatGPT-style bot Bloomberg mentioned.""We tend to announce things as they come to market,"" Cook said. ""And that's our aim and I'd like to stick to that.""While a lack of AI excitement likely didn't drive the negative price action on Apple's stock, companies that have played up their AI success aren't benefiting as much this quarter either. With the exception of Meta (META), which attributed AI to boosting revenues in the current quarter, investors have seemed more concerned with the current state of things rather than celebrating potential AI benefits to come down the line.Snap (SNAP) boasted more than 150 million users have engaged with its My AI chatbot.But Wall Street appeared stuck on the cost of the investment. The stock fell more than 14% after the company reported.""The challenge here is Snap's investments to rebuild its (direct response) ad platform and offer newer products and tools to improve engagement are resulting in higher (artificial intelligence and machine learning) costs pressuring gross margins, EBITDA, and free-cash-flow,"" Ron Josey, Citi managing director of internet equity research, wrote after Snap earnings.It's not just that AI callouts aren't boosting stock prices this quarter, either. Momentum has slowed for some of the industry's biggest names leading into their reports, too. Nvidia, which is expected to report earnings on August 23, has seen its stock rise more than 200% this year due to its AI prospects. In the past week though, the stock has fallen 4% in the past week and is up just 6% over the last month, suggesting the stock's meteoric rise may be taking a break.""Post-earnings reaction could see some near-term stock consolidation following the 200%+ move up YTD,"" Bank of America research analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Monday.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Highest Rates Of Smoking.Smoking remains a pervasive global health concern and certain countries like Lebanon. Serbia and Bulgaria have faced the enduring challenge of high smoking rates within their populations and stand among the top ten countries with the highest percentage of smokers. Despite extensive awareness campaigns and anti-smoking initiatives, these nations grapple with the intricate web of cultural, economic, and regulatory factors perpetuating smoking habits. The consequences of these high smoking rates are far-reaching, from a surge in preventable diseases to an immense burden on healthcare systems. This introductory exploration delves into the highest smoking countries in the world, shedding light on the complexities of this issue and the urgent need for effective strategies to combat the tobacco epidemic. Prevalence of Smoking: A Comparative Analysis Smoking is a prevalent habit that has been around for centuries. It has been estimated that approximately one billion people worldwide smoke, with most smokers residing in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of smoking varies across different regions, with some countries having a higher smoking rate than others. Financial statistics show that individuals with a lower income are more likely to smoke than those with a higher income. Studies have shown that individuals below the poverty line are twice as likely to smoke as those above it for various reasons, including the fact that tobacco products are often cheaper than healthier alternatives. For example, a pack of cigarettes can cost anywhere from $5-$10. The prices are way cheaper in the emerging economies.Additionally, individuals with a lower income may be under more stress, making them more likely to turn to smoking as a coping mechanism. Cultural norms also play a significant role in smoking rates. In some cultures, smoking is seen as a sign of masculinity or sophistication, making it more socially acceptable. For instance, in some countries, smoking is associated with the image of a successful businessman. Story continuesAdditionally, advertising and marketing by tobacco companies like Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) have played a significant role in promoting smoking as a fashionable and desirable habit. In 2019, tobacco companies spent $8.2 billion on advertising and promotions in the United States alone. Despite the many factors contributing to the prevalence of smoking, many efforts are also being made to reduce smoking rates. Governments and organizations worldwide are implementing policies and programs to reduce smoking rates. For example, increasing taxes on tobacco products is an effective way to reduce smoking rates. According to American Lung Association, every 10% increase in cigarette prices in the United States has been linked to a 4% decrease in smoking rates. Implementing smoke-free laws and offering smoking cessation programs have also effectively reduced smoking rates. Smokeless Tobacco Products: A Hidden Challenge in Some Countries As businesses like Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco expand globally, it's crucial to be aware of cultural differences and customs in other countries, which is particularly important in the sale and marketing of tobacco products, especially as the global tobacco market is expected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2030. In some countries, smokeless tobacco products from Swedish Match AB, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) are a popular alternative to traditional cigarettes. However, these products can pose a hidden challenge for businesses that must become more familiar with the local market. Understanding the regulations surrounding these products and ensuring that marketing materials are culturally appropriate is essential. By taking these steps, businesses can navigate the complexities of the global tobacco market and ensure that they are operating safely, reasonably, and socially responsibly. Emerging Trends in Harm Reduction Strategies Harm reduction strategies have been gaining popularity in recent years as more and more people realize the importance of minimizing the negative consequences of drug use. Emerging trends in harm reduction strategies include a focus on community involvement and education, as well as the use of technology to improve access to resources and support. One promising trend is the integration of harm-reduction strategies into healthcare systems. This approach recognizes that drug use is a health issue, not just a criminal one, and seeks to provide individuals with the tools and resources they need to stay safe and healthy, which can include things like needle exchange programs, overdose prevention training, and access to medications like naloxone that can reverse opioid overdoses. According to a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2021, over 106,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States alone. The US's economic cost of drug abuse is estimated to be over $151.4 billion annually. By implementing harm reduction strategies, healthcare systems can reduce the negative impact of drug abuse on individuals and society. Another trend is using technology to improve harm reduction efforts, including smartphone apps that provide information on safe injection practices, overdose prevention, and telemedicine services that allow individuals to access care remotely. These tools can benefit people living in rural areas with limited access to healthcare services.  20 Countries With The Highest Rates Of SmokingJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the countries with the highest age standardized smoking rates (for both sexes) in ascending order as of  2023. For the accuracy of the data, we relied on the Global Health Observatory of World Health Organization. Here is our list of the 20 countries with the highest rates of smoking.20. Bangladesh  Total Smoking Rate: 17.1% Smoking affects about 17.1% of the population in bengladesh, putting it on the list of countries with the highest rates of smoking. The economic cost of tobacco in 2018 was around $3.6 billion, making up 1.4% GDP of the country. Each year, more than 100,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses, and the financial burden on families is significant due to high tobacco costs and healthcare expenses. Urgent action is needed to address this alarming situation. 19. Myanmar Total Smoking Rate: 18.7% Myanmar is one of the countries with the highest rates of smoking. Annually, approximately 64,000 lives are claimed by tobacco use in Myanmar, and a significant 56% of these deaths occur among individuals under 70. In 2016, the economic toll of tobacco use amounted to MMK 2.6 trillion ($1.7 billion), which accounts for approximately 3.3% of the country's GDP. Furthermore, healthcare expenses related to tobacco use amounted to MMK 307 billion ($1.9 billion).18. Laos  Total Smoking Rate: 24.5% In Laos, smoking is widespread, with about 24.5% of the age standardized population being smokers. A packet of cigarettes costs less than $1 in the country, which leads to more people buying cigarettes resulting in smoke pollution. Moreover, secondhand smoke exposure is a significant concern, putting non-smokers at risk of developing smoking-related illnesses and impacting their quality of life. Tobacco use in Lao PDR leads to nearly 6,800 deaths annually and incurs a cost of 3.6 trillion Lao Kip ($393,300) annually. 17. ChileTotal Smoking Rate: 27.2%Prevalence of smoking is higher among men than women in Chile. In 2017, smoking caused 16,472 deaths in Chile, making up about 16% of all deaths. The impact included 416,445 DALYs annually, and the healthcare system spent approximately 1.15 trillion pesos (around U$D 1.8 billion) on treating smoking-related illnesses. Raising tobacco prices by 50% could prevent 13,665 deaths and 360,476 DALYs over a decade, leading to cost savings in healthcare and increased tax revenue. However, the tobacco tax collection still falls short of covering the full healthcare costs associated with smoking in Chile.16. Timor Leste Total Smoking Rate: 30.5% Every year, tobacco-related diseases claim over 700 lives in Timor-Leste, and smoking costs the country approximately USD 64 million annually, equivalent to about 1.5% of its GDP. Cigarettes are less expensive in East Timor than in the United States. Local cigarettes cost $1.40 per pack, while famous brands like Camel, Marlboro, and L&amp;M cost around $1.80. 15. Greece  Total Smoking Rate: 31.3% Smoking is prevalent in Greece, with the rate standing at 31.3%, one of the highest in Europe. Based on data from the World Bank, the expenses for smoking-related healthcare in Greece range from 0.1% to 1.1% of the country's GDP. In 2016, Greece's GDP was approximately 288,418 million USD, which indicates that about 288 to 3,172 million USD is allocated annually to cover healthcare costs associated with smoking-related diseases in the country. Despite efforts to reduce smoking rates through taxation and smoking bans, more action is needed to address this issue. 14. Andorra Total Smoking Rate: 31.3% Smoking is a notable issue in Andorra, with 31.3% age standardized rate of smoking as of 2023. The health consequences are well-documented, with respiratory diseases, heart issues, and cancer prevalent. Smoking-related healthcare costs strain the country's economy. Deaths caused by smoking continue to rise, making it the leading preventable cause of death in Andorra. The government has increased tobacco taxes and launched anti-smoking campaigns to combat this. Additionally, the financial impact on smokers is substantial, with the packet of Marlboro by Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) cigarettes costing around 4 euros ($4).13. Indonesia  Total Smoking Rate: 32.6% Indonesia is one of the most tobacco smoking countries in the world with over 50 million smokers, making it one of the largest smoking populations globally. Tragically, as WHO notes, around 225,700 people die annually in Indonesia due to smoking-related illnesses, out of which many die due to secondhand smoke, making it a significant public health concern. Moreover, smoking is a substantial financial burden for many individuals, affecting their ability to afford the habit and impacting their overall economic well-being. In Indonesia, a pack of cigarettes costs around $1.65, lower than the global average of $3.38 and the average in the Asia-Pacific region of $4.67. 12. France Total Smoking Rate: 33.3% France has a 33.3% age standardized smoking rate, making it one of the most tobacco smoking countries in the world. This addiction leads to severe health issues, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems, impacting individuals and the healthcare system. Annual cigarette consumption has declined by 40% per adult and 35% per smoker between 2004 and 2020. Smoking-related illnesses claim around 78,000 lives in France annually, emphasizing the urgent need for continued efforts to address this public health and economic concern. 11. Bosnia And Herzegovina  Total Smoking Rate: 33.5% Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries with the highest percentage of smokers, with around 33.5% of the age-controlled population being smokers. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the most recent data reveals that tobacco-smoking-related diseases led to approximately 8,595 annual deaths. Among these deaths, about 2,500 were women, while 6,100 were men. The economic cost in 2019 ranged from €367.5 to €635.1 million (2.0%-3.5% of GDP), with direct costs being the largest share (1.0%-1.7% of GDP). 10. Lebanon Total Smoking Rate: 33.7% Tragically, about 3,500 people die annually due to smoking-related diseases in Lebanon. Smoking is also a financial burden for individuals, with cigarettes being expensive in Lebanon, with a pack of 20 costing around $11.50, nearly twice the price in New York City.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Synthica EnergyThe new capital will help grow Synthica's infrastructure projects and accelerate the development of its facilities in key target markets across the country, including Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana in the near term. Over the coming years, Synthica also plans to develop clean energy facilities in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania.""Synthica's mission is to provide a critical service for hard-to-process organic waste streams, divert these materials away from landfills and other non-sustainable disposal outlets, and ultimately reduce carbon and methane emissions,"" said Sam Schutte, CEO of Synthica. ""We are excited about partnering with Goldman Sachs since it will enable us to accelerate our project development pipeline, enhance our circular solutions for our customers, and supply RNG to meet the growing market demand.""Founded in 2017, Synthica aims to produce RNG from pre-consumer food and beverage waste and other organic manufacturing byproducts. Distinct from many existing RNG developers, who largely focus on dairy products from farms or mixed solid waste from landfills, Synthica's infrastructure business model focuses on processing pre-consumer organic waste.Synthica supports a green energy transition by aiming to provide a circular waste management solution at convenient facilities located a short drive away from city centers and repurpose pre-consumer organic waste, which might otherwise be disposed of in a landfill and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Through anaerobic digestion, Synthica plans to convert this organic waste into valuable RNG that can be used for a variety of drop-in fuel purposes in place of fossil fuels and help customers or offtakers achieve their decarbonization targets and sustainability goals, including with respect to recycling and landfill diversion.Story continuesThe company's focus on pre-consumer organic waste gives Synthica access to a large and stable supply of input material from major food, beverage, and industrial manufacturers. The company enters into contracts to accept customers' waste as feedstock, providing a low-cost, proximate, sustainable alternative to landfill disposal. Unlike post-consumer waste, which can vary in supply and contamination levels, pre-consumer waste streams enable greater efficiency and consistency in the production of RNG.Synthica will continue to be led by its co-founders, Sam Schutte and Grant Gibson. Mark Weidman, a recognized leader in the waste-to-energy sector, and former CEO of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., will serve as executive chairman.""With this investment, we are aiming to take waste out of a one-way system and recycle it to generate renewable energy,"" said Cedric Lucas, a Managing Director in the Infrastructure Business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""Similar to our Verdalia investment in Europe focused on biomethane, we believe this sustainable process can provide dual benefits, helping businesses and municipalities beneficially reuse their organic waste and supplying the country's utilities with RNG, critical for reducing their carbon footprints.

(WBD), joins Universal's ""Super Mario Bros. Movie"" (CMCSA) as the only two films to hit the $1 billion milestone so far this year. ""Super Mario Bros. Movie"" has surpassed $1.3 billion since its April debut.Another milestone? Gerwig is the first woman to solely direct a $1 billion-dollar movie.Industry watchers have championed ""Barbie's"" record-breaking wins, along with the success of Universal's ""Oppenheimer,"" which opened the same weekend as ""Barbie.""""It feels like the pinnacle of the year so far — especially after a summer where we've seen a lot of franchise sequels miss expectations by varying degrees,"" Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins previously told Yahoo Finance, stressing the pop culture ""zeitgeist"" both films have managed to create — particularly with ""Barbie,"" which has relied on a heavy marketing push to drum up anticipation.Writer/director/executive producer Greta Gerwig poses for photographers upon arrival at the premiere of the film 'Barbie' on Wednesday, July 12, 2023, in London. (Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP)Films like Disney's ""Elemental"" and Warner Bros.' ""The Flash"" struggled to secure ticket sales earlier this summer, while the hyped-up live-action ""Little Mermaid"" fell short of expectations.Robbins said many of the laggards this year, such as ""Indiana Jones,"" had been out of the public consciousness for years while there has also been oversaturation in the market when it comes to franchises.""We're in a time now where people are a little bit more selective with what they're choosing to spend their money on,"" he said.Wall Street analysts have also turned bullish amid the ""Barbenheimer"" hype.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Overweight rating on Cinemark's (CNK) stock and upped his price target to $24 a share, an increase from the prior $22.Story continues""Conviction in studios and consumers embracing theatrical has been further reinforced by the Barbenheimer summer,"" the analyst wrote in a new note, despite the overhang of the double strike in Hollywood.Strike uncertainties loom for theater chainsPicketers carry signs on the picket line outside Universal Studios on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023, in Universal City, Calif. The actors strike comes more than two months after screenwriters began striking in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)Last month, actors joined writers on the picket line for the first time since 1960.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — announced the strike after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Warner Bros., Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA).The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents about 11,500 television and movie writers, called for a strike in early May. WGA leaders met with studio representatives on Friday to discuss restarting negotiations; however, no new negotiations have been set at this point as the standstill drags on.In a report released last month, Moody's predicted ""a relatively long strike,"" which would hit movie theater companies such as AMC and Cineworld (CINE.L) first, followed by diversified media companies with both streaming and linear television businesses.""If there is a protracted strike, cinema operators are most at risk with their nearly complete dependency on new product,"" Moody's said. ""Theatrical exhibitors are already strained from damage caused by the COVID pandemic such as lighter release schedules that followed and shortened distribution windowing. They also have mostly weaker balance sheets and credit ratings.""Still, Morgan Stanley's Swinburne said the uncertainty created by the strikes won't last forever.""Labor strikes create uncertainty, but ultimately it is temporary,"" he wrote. ""While visibility remains limited here, in our view, unless production remains shut down beyond late-fall, we see limited impact on the '24 slate. Strikes-aside, studios continue to build back production and we expect increased film supply from both traditional and streaming studios over the next few years.""Not everyone agrees, however.Richard Greenfield, media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners, told Yahoo Finance he foresees the strikes lasting until at least November, adding the prolonged work stoppage will be ""very disruptive"" to the business of Hollywood in the fourth quarter.""This is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize,"" the analyst warned.Late last month, Sony reshuffled its 2023-2024 film schedule, citing the strikes.""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" — the sequel to the widely successful ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" — was quietly removed from the 2024 release calendar. It was expected to hit theaters on March 29, 2024.Recent reports have said studios like Warner Bros. and Disney are also weighing changes to their respective slates as a direct result of the strikes.Variety reported Warner Bros. is ""strongly considering"" pushing the highly anticipated ""Dune"" sequel to next year from its current Nov. 3 debut.

It makes the film's director, Greta Gerwig, the first female director to reach that milestone. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal explains how the success of Barbie may ""fundamentally change the types of movies that are produced at the box office,"" noting how studios habitually invest in action-filled films targeted towards males.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRAD SMITH: ""Barbie"" has hit the billion dollar mark at the box office. Warner Brothers calls its watershed moment. It's also a big moment for director Greta Gerwig. She becomes the first woman to hit the milestone in just 17 days after the film was released. Joining us now to discuss Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Hey, Ale.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Barbie. Hey, guys. If you saw the movie, you get the reference there. But yes, there are quite a few milestones that were reached here. We only have 28 male directors to have the sole credit for those $1 billion films. And now just one female director for that sole credit, which is Greta Gerwig. There have been a few women that have had co-directing titles to have movies reach the $1 billion club, but it's pretty rare. There's only about 50 films out there, and we had two so far this year. ""Barbie"" being the second. The first being ""The Super Mario Brothers Movie, which was produced by NBC Universal.So I think this is a really big moment for Warner Brothers Discovery because it's the first film that they've seen reach 1 billion since their merger of last year. Clearly, they're all in on ""Barbie"". I mean, even their earnings was pink when they released it last week. So this is, I think, going to fundamentally change the types of movies that are produced at the box office because for a long time really the story was these action films, these male-driven films, they are the ones that are safe bets at the box office. And even for ""Barbie"", it didn't come with a squeal. There was still hesitation in the leadership ranks if this was going to perform and do well.Story continuesClearly, this is bucking that trend. So I think we're going to see a lot more female-driven stories and obviously a lot more confidence in the female director as well.JULIE HYMAN: At the same time, what's on the docket? In other words, like, there's so much hype around this movie. It feels like in terms of repeatable--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right.JULIE HYMAN: --other hits, whether it's by women or anyone that's on tap for Warner Brothers-- in other words, like, if you look at what's coming up, are there other non-franchise, non-action movies that people are as excited-- I mean, nothing even comes close, right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Not really.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, with the strike, yes, but even so.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Even so, I think after the summer, the fall is pretty chill for the most part. There's nothing crazy coming out that I think is capturing attention. And you also have to remember the promotion around this movie, the marketing spend was astronomical, it was insane. And I think that added to the hype as well. And then obviously, you mentioned the strike. I think that points to 2024. There's going to be a bit of risk there, especially for a lot of these theatrical giants. So you have to wonder once the strike ends, whenever that will be, hopefully soon, what those types of conversations are going to be like when it comes to really pinning down the future theatrical slate in 2024, and even beyond in 2025 and 2026. So I think that's going to be the top story to watch.But again, the box office is in a state of disarray right now with these strikes.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I'm looking at what's coming up. We got another sore. Nobody asked for that one.ALEXANDRA CANAL: The squeal, right?JULIE HYMAN: We got another ""Aquaman"". We got ""The Marvels"". Is there another ""Hunger Games""? Oh, that's right. The prequel.ALEXANDRA CANAL: The prequel.JULIE HYMAN: It's like, oh, come on.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Because those are the safe bets for theaters. But I think clearly audiences are showing they want fresh original content. They want new ideas. And so I think studios are going to have to be forced to listen to that at some point.BRAD SMITH: It's just nothing to be excited about.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know.JULIE HYMAN: I want to see ""The Marvels"", but I'm not like--BRAD SMITH: ""The Marvels"", yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --wow.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know. After this, like, the past couple of weeks, it's such a letdown after Barbenheimer.BRAD SMITH: It just goes to show how well executed of a holistic, omnichannel, omni approach type of plan this was for Mattel, for Warner Brothers to be able to bring this to life that you had people dressing up to go see the movie. You have all of us buying-- I bought a mug.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I dressed up too. I was in--BRAD SMITH: I bought Kenough mug.JULIE HYMAN: All right. We got to leave it there, guys.]"

In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 7.14%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second quarter, the performance of Perrigo’s Consumer Self Care Americas (“CSCA”) and Consumer Self Care International (“CSCI”) segments is expected to have been aided by products added through its HRA Pharma acquisition. Significant sales growth of new products is likely to have boosted sales in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, currency movements and loss of sales following the divestiture of Latin American businesses are likely to have affected the company’s ex-U.S. sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for CSCA sales stand at $770 million and $775 million, respectively. For sales in the CSCI segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate are pegged at $415 million and $411 million, respectively.Higher demand for infant formula in the United States is also likely to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Perrigo reported higher net price realization for its products through strategic price increases in the last two quarters. The improving price trend will likely be reflected in second-quarter sales, benefiting the top line.We expect macroeconomic factors like cost headwinds (including the higher cost of goods sold), the rising cost of capital and supply chain disruptionsin certain parts of the world amid the Russia-Ukraine war to have hurt the company’s operating margins.Investors are likely to ask questions about potential product launches this year.

Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive.Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds. Amazon’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives.However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are also concerns. Intensifying cloud competition poses a serious risk.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Netflix shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+84.8% vs. +28.9%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind.

The company’s several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. The Zacks analyst expects the top line at around $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments. However, with higher utilization of the firm’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the margins.Marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise.

The company also announced private equity firm KKR (KKR) will be buying its Simon &amp; Schuster business for $1.62 billion in an all-cash deal. Parrot Analytics PR &amp; Communications Manager Wade Payson-Denney says the Simon &amp; Schuster deal is ""a sign of things to come"" as companies look to offload linear or ""old-school media arms."" On the company's streaming business, Payson-Denney says ""it's hard for us to see, really, how Paramount+ makes the jump to that top three streaming category that clearly Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery currently have a hold on.""Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Shares of Paramount trading higher, up about 7% after its earnings. The company beating on both the top and bottom line. Paramount also announcing investment management company, KKR, will purchase Simon and Schuster from Paramount for $1.6 billion.For more on this, we want to turn to Wade Payson-Denney. Wade is PR and communications manager for Parrot Analytics. So Wade, thank you so much for joining us. At first blush in terms of this or these latest results, what's your take on Paramount?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Oh, well, first, congrats to you on getting out of the 100 well done. But, yeah, this is, I would say kind of to be expected. We have seen Paramount Plus growing its market share with originals with platform had a really good quarter in terms of both of those metrics. So, you know, we often see that demand for original content is a leading indicator of subscriber growth.I think, you know, all of the media companies are going to report slightly better earnings this quarter, if anything, because they're not making new shows, you know, because of the strikes. And then as far as the KK-- as far as the Simon Schuster sale to KKR, I do think that's a sign of things to come. I do think more of these companies are going to be selling off, selling off, you know, linear, kind of like old school media arms to private equity as we move forward.Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: So do you think this is part of the great consolidation in streaming that people have been talking-- I've been talking about this for years, something that's probably coming down the pike? Or is this just part of a larger media reorganization cycle that just seems to happen every 10 to 20 years?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Maybe a bit of both. Look, I think I think Paramount Global, you know, what they've done with Paramount Plus, as far as effectively, you know, closing off Showtime, bringing all of that content onto Paramount Plus that that has helped with scale, I find it-- it's hard for us to see really how Paramount Plus makes the jump to that top three streaming category that clearly Netflix, Disney, and Warner Brothers Discovery currently have a hold on. You know, I think there's certainly an important player. They have really beloved franchises for, I mean, specifically, you know, ""Star Trek"" and Taylor Sheridan fans, like, they're not going to go anywhere else. And there's a lot of those.So that's a big plus for Paramount Plus. And yeah, you know, I think it does seem like-- yeah, as far as Paramount Global is concerned, you know, we saw reports of them trying to sell off BET earlier. I think if KKR is willing to, you know, actually make that acquisition, then I think some of the-- either them or one of their competitors might be willing to look at BET maybe, even CBS.Yeah. I think just based on the Simon and Schuster sale, I do think that that's not the last time we're going to see this kind of thing happen.DIANE KING HALL: So there has been talk before about them potentially selling off CBS. But could you see that really happening, given the sports piece of the business when you think about how lucrative sports is and especially given the NFL access that CBS has?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Yeah, no. I think I don't see it happening in the short term. I mean, you know, that CBS has the Super Bowl early next year at the conclusion of this season. And that's what like 7 million for 30-second ads. Yeah, they're not going to get rid of that anytime soon. So, yeah. And look, the NFL, that's really the-- I mean, the NFL owns linear TV, you know? If you look at last year of the 100 most viewed broadcasts, 82 were NFL games. That's up from 75 in 2021. And I do think that that's only going to grow, especially with the lack of, you know, scripted series that will be seeing at the beginning of the broadcast season next month.JARED BLIKRE: We got a little bit of time here for one more. I'll give you the floor. Anything you haven't talked about here that you think is important to talk about in the Paramount discussion.WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: I think that if you-- I think soccer's a big deal. I think if you look at not just, you know, obviously kids playing it, those numbers are always growing. But if you look at soccer and television and streaming, you know, Ted Lasso was a massive hit for Apple TV Plus. It really put Apple TV Plus on the map as far as like a home for Emmy-winning content.If you look at FX and Hulu with ""Welcome to Wrexham,"" the docuseries about Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's soccer club in Wales, that was a huge hit. Messi is just like taking over Apple TV Plus. Paramount Plus has the UEFA Champions League. That's, you know, probably the top. That's like the pinnacle of club soccer of-- club soccer competition worldwide. So I think having that in the US is going to be a big asset. And I think they have the Serie, which is Italian soccer. It's not quite as big as the Premier League, but AC Milan is now owned by American ownership. So, you know, I think they'll probably be taking advantage more of that as we move forward.DIANE KING HALL: A different direction than I was expecting, Wade. I thought you were going to talk more about the impact of the writers and actors strike, which we'll certainly be watching if that, you know, how much longer that takes and when it becomes damaging or more damaging to these companies. But we will have to leave it there for now Wade Payson-Denney, thank you so much for the deep dive into Paramount.]"

QuoteFactors to NoteArhaus’ performance in the second quarter is likely to have benefited from healthy demand for products, a solid backlog and strength in the showroom and eCommerce channels. The company’s investments in product development, marketing and omnichannel &amp; technology capabilities are expected to have boosted its performance and supported growth.The company’s efficient brand-building strategies, effective product assortment management and robust e-commerce sales channel, driven by increased online shopping, are likely to have driven its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Its focus on expansion into new markets with investments in showrooms, partnerships and digital competencies are likely to have been tailwinds during the quarter. Also, the normalization of the supply chain is likely to have improved order deliveries, enhancing its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Arhaus exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $145 million and no long-term debt. Its strong debt-free balance sheet is expected to have enabled it to navigate the prevalent macroeconomic backdrop while executing its growth strategy in the quarter.However, Arhaus has been subject to cost-related hurdles for a while now. In the first quarter, the company’s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 18.7% and 10.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings per share has declined 1.4% over the past 30 days to 69 cents. The figure suggests a fall of 54% from the year-ago period’s reported number.Capri Holdings has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this London-based company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 3.2%.Capri Holdings Limited Price and EPS SurpriseCapri Holdings Limited Price and EPS SurpriseCapri Holdings Limited price-eps-surprise | Capri Holdings Limited QuoteFactors to NoteCapri Holdings has been witnessing sluggish demand for its products, particularly in the Americas, for a while now. Softness across both retail and wholesale businesses, owing to tepid consumer spending across all brands, is expected to have adversely impacted the company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter. Management anticipates revenues from the Americas region to fall year-over-year and foresees a decline of approximately 30% in the wholesale channel.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues of $245 million from Versace and $775 million from Michael Kors, indicating year-over-year declines of 11% and 15%, respectively, on a reported basis. However, Jimmy Choo’s revenues are anticipated to be $180 million, indicating an increase of 5% year-over-year.Rising costs and operating expenses have been a concern for the company over the past few quarters. For instance, in fiscal 2023, its total operating expenses increased 7.2% year over year. Our model indicates a 7.9% increase in operating expenses year over year in the fiscal first quarter.For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects an adjusted operating margin of 8.5%, in line with our estimate. The figure reflects a decline from 18.5% reported in the year-ago period. The decline primarily reflects the significant deleverage on lower wholesale revenues, apart from higher investments in marketing.The company projected an operating margin at a break-even level for Versace and in the mid-teens range for Michael Kors and for Jimmy Choo, it expected an operating margin in the high-single-digit range. This might get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom line. As a result, management guided first-quarter earnings of approximately 70 cents per share, down from $1.50 reported in the prior-year quarter.Given its extensive presence across international markets, a stronger U.S. dollar might have hurt its overseas business in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Capri Holdings is likely to have benefited from improvements in demand in Asia and the EMEA regions. The company’s focus on operational execution and effective pricing actions are expected to have a positive impact on its performance.CPRI’s retail and e-commerce businesses have been witnessing a sturdy performance, thanks to its outlet stores and the increasing popularity of online shopping. It has been investing in digital analytics and upgrading its e-commerce platform. E-commerce sales witnessed significant growth over the past few quarters, a trend likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Capri Holdings this time around.

106,59d4e26d-8901-31ec-82c5-21836ed835cc,NEM,2023-08-08,3 Gold Stocks You Shouldn’t Touch With a 10-Foot Pole,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-gold-stocks-shouldn-t-130009688.html,1690894809,STORY,"['GC=F', 'HG=F', 'KGC', 'GOLD', 'NEM']","[A lot of traders and analysts are bullish on gold. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just issued a new forecast that predicts the price of gold will hit record levels in 2024. Analysts at JPM are urging investors to take a position in gold ahead of a likely U.S. recession, predicting that the price of the precious metal will rise above $2,000 an ounce by year end and hit record highs in 2024 as interest rates begin to fall. JPMorgan has placed a price target on gold of $2,175 an ounce by the fourth and final quarter of 2024 amid calls for a mild recession. In May of this year, the price of gold approached a record high of $2,075.47 an ounce before pulling back to its current level of $1,960 an ounce. JPMorgan sees a coming drop in interest rates as a potential catalyst for gold, which should play out in the second quarter of next year.While the bullish outlook is encouraging, it doesn’t mean that investors should rush out and put capital in any gold stock they find. Many gold producers are poorly run and have shoddy track records, and their stocks have proven to be bad long-term investments. Here are three high-risk gold stocks you shouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole.Barrick Gold (GOLD)a cart filed with gold in a gold mineSource: ShutterstockIt’s been a bad year so far for Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). The Canadian miner began 2023 by announcing in February that it was cutting its quarterly dividend by 33% to 10 cents a share. Then in April, the company announced that its first-quarter gold production fell 15% as winter weather and annual maintenance hurt operations at its various mine sites. In May, Barrick reported abysmal Q1 earnings, announcing that its profit was 73% lower than a year earlier at $120 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAll the bad news has led GOLD stock to decrease 5% year-to-date as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index has advanced 20%. The company has said that it expects production of both gold and copper, which it also mines, to increase throughout this year. However, shareholders clearly aren’t waiting for a turnaround, with many hitting the “sell” button on the stock. Worth noting is that Warren Buffett had taken a $565 million position in GOLD stock in 2020 but quickly sold his entire stake in the company. Clearly, it’s one of the high-risk gold stocks to avoid.Story continuesKinross Gold Corp. (KGC)Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAnother Canadian gold miner that is not worth investors’ capital is Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC). While KGC stock looks to be on an upswing having gained 13% this year, the long-term trend is ugly. Currently, KGC trades as a penny stock, i.e. below $5 per share. While the share price has risen this year, it is currently trading at half the level it was at in 2020 when the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic sent many investors running to the relative safety of gold.Look any further, and you’ll find KGC stock has performed even worse. Kinross Gold’s share price hit an all-time high of just under $30 back in 1996. Since then, the stock has steadily eroded, sliding into penny stock territory. The problems afflicting the stock have included poor financial results and declining profitability relative to other gold miners. The company announced in 2022 that it was selling its Russian gold mining assets to privately held Highland Gold Mining Ltd. for $680 million in cash. But that sale was eventually completed at half the agreed-upon price. Add KGC to your list of high-risk gold stocks that won’t be worth your while.Newmont Corp. (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockColorado-based Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) might be the largest gold miner in the world, but that fact hasn’t helped its share price lately. Since January, NEM stock has declined 14% — this in the middle of a bull market. Over the last five years, the stock has gained a middling 16%, making it one of the least favorable gold stocks. Disappointing output at the company’s gold mines, coupled with poor earnings, have pressured the stock.Newmont just announced Q2 results for this year that showed its gold production fell 17% to 1.24 million ounces due to a labor strike in Mexico and the shutdown of mine sites in Canada due to ongoing wildfires. As a result, revenue in the quarter declined 12% from a year earlier while earnings per share dropped 28% to 33 cents. Newmont is now finalizing its $17.8 billion acquisition of Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining (TSE:NCM), which is still subject to shareholder approval. This casts a cloud of uncertainty over the company, resulting in an unstable gold stock at best.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

107,942a3080-0b99-36af-8357-d4a475b357b8,M,2023-08-08,Goldman Sachs Says Now Could Be the Best Time to Buy These 2 Stocks — Here’s Why They’re on the Conviction List,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-now-could-230150690.html,1691362910,STORY,"['GS', 'CVX', 'M']","[This year started with a red-hot stock market, there is no question of that. Since the start of 2023, even accounting for losses last week, the S&amp;P 500 shows a year-to-date gain of 17%, and the NASDAQ is up 33%.Currently, the gains are narrow, mainly relying on a handful of deep-pocketed, big-name tech firms, but there’s a likelihood that investor money will start spreading more widely. If the bull market does widen out, it will raise the question of which stocks to buy.This is where Goldman Sachs comes in. The banking giant has a special rating for stocks which it holds in particularly high regard. This is called a ‘Conviction Buy’ rating. The firm’s prized list of Conviction Buy stocks reveals the stock picks that the firm’s analysts expect to beat the market.Now, let’s zoom in on two such names that have earned a spot on Goldman Sachs’ list of top stock ideas.Chevron Corporation (CVX)The first Goldman pick we’ll look at is Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil companies, with a market cap of $298 billion and annual revenues in the neighborhood of $240 billion. The company’s operations are varied and include hydrocarbon exploration and production, a transportation division that includes a maritime shipping company, an active refining segment producing fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, and additives, a retail division to market the refined products (including a chain of gasoline filling stations), and a 50/50 joint venture with Phillips 66 in the industrial fuel and chemical sector.Post-COVID, the price of oil peaked in May of last year, and the price since then has been downward. Chevron’s financials have tracked with the price of oil, declining from a 2Q22 peak – but the company remains profitable, benefiting from continued high demand for oil and fuels. Consumer demand for oil has been rising this year and is expected to increase by 2.2 million barrels per day to reach a year-end average of 102.1 million barrels per day.Story continuesOn the financial side, Chevron reported its 2Q23 results last month, and despite the continuing fall-off from peak values it beat the expectations on both revenues and earnings. The top line, a revenue total of $48.9 billion, was down 29% year-over-year, but was over $900 million better than the forecast. At the bottom line, the company’s EPS of $3.20 beat the estimates by 22 cents per share. In addition to beating the earnings forecasts, Chevron also generated $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. The company returned a record amount of capital to shareholders, a total of $7.2 billion.That return to shareholders included the regular share dividend. Chevron last declared its dividend on July 28, for $1.51 per share. This annualizes to $6.04 per common share, and yields 3.8%. Chevron has a dividend history going back to 1990, and has been gradually raising the payment since 2005.Goldman’s 5-star analyst Neil Mehta is impressed by Chevron’s cash and capital returns, and writes of the stock: “Look for an inflection in the US oil major’s shares as (a) key upstream projects come online and other execution risks abate, driving robust cash generation, (b) shares are supported by a leading capital returns profile among large cap Energy and the S&amp;P100, and (c) relatively attractive valuation.”Looking forward, Mehta rates Chevron as a Conviction Buy, and his price target of $187 indicates room for a 17% upside potential in the year ahead. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)Overall, Chevron gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Wall Street consensus, based on 16 recent analyst reviews that break down 10 to 6 favoring Buys over Holds. The shares are priced at $159.31, and the average price target of $186.50 is practically the same as Mehta’s. (See Chevron stock forecast)Macy’s, Inc. (M)Next up is Macy’s, a well-known name in American retail. Tracing its origins back to 1858, this department store has evolved into an omni-channel retailer, boasting a significant e-commerce footprint and a network of brick-and-mortar stores. Macy’s offers quality brands across all price ranges, from upscale luxury to off-price discount, providing customers with a seamless and convenient shopping experience.The company owns several brands, including its eponymous department stores, as well as Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. As of the end of the calendar year 2022, Macy’s operated 783 stores across all of its brands, with 566 Macy’s locations and 160 Bluemercury stores.In an interesting move, Macy’s announced in March plans to conduct a transition in its corporate leadership. The current CEO, Jeff Gennette, will be retiring in February of next year after 40 years with the company. His position will be taken over by Tony Spring, who is currently an executive VP with Macy’s and the CEO of the Bloomingdale’s brand.The company will release its 2Q23 financial results on August 22, but we can look back at Q1 to see where Macy’s stands now. The top line, of $5 billion, was slightly down from $5.3 billion in the prior-year quarter and $84 million below analyst expectations. However, Macy’s demonstrated stronger bottom-line results, with a 56-cent GAAP EPS, which was 10 cents better than the forecast. Looking ahead, Macy’s has revised its expectations for FY2023 sales, now projecting a range of $22.8B to $23.2B. This adjustment comes in contrast to the previous projection of $23.7B to $24.2B and falls below the consensus estimate of $24.01B.Macy’s has a history of paying out cash dividends since 2003, with a brief interruption from early 2020 to the summer of 2021 due to the pandemic. Dividend payments resumed in August 2021 and have been gradually rising since then. The latest declaration on May 31 was for a 16.54 cent payment, distributed on June 15. The common share dividend currently annualizes to just over 66 cents, offering a yield of 4.06%.This stock is covered for Goldman Sachs by analyst Brooke Roach, who sees the company poised for success on the back of a new growth strategy. She is also impressed by strength of the company’s brand and cash positions, and writes: “Look for the US department store to execute on its five pillar growth strategy after successfully completing ‘trial and learn phases’ this year. Focus on M’s new idiosyncratic initiatives, and look for strengthening execution and improving inventory management to drive market share capture, growth, and profitability, supported by Macy’s strong brand positioning and FCF generation.”Roach goes on to give Macy’s a Conviction Buy rating, with a $23 price target implying a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Roach’s track record, click here)The rest of the Street is less confident, however; based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds, plus 2 additional Sells, the stock has a Hold consensus rating. Meanwhile, the stock’s average price target of $18.33 suggests an upside of ~12% from the current selling price of $16.31.

The metric suggests an improvement of 64.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors to NoteWynn Resorts’ top-line growth in the second quarter is expected to have been backed by strong demand for sports betting, non-gaming revenue-boosting strategies and expansion efforts. This and continued rooms pricing power and a robust programming calendar are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased visitation (in the Las Vegas market) and robust recovery in the Macau region (owing to the easing of restrictions) are likely to have supported the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Per our model, revenues from Las Vegas operations are expected to rise 27% year over year (to $712.6 million) in the second quarter. We expect revenues from Macau operations to rise 239.9% year over year to $398.5 million.Strong contributions from Encore Boston Harbor might have aided the company’s first-quarter top line. We expect revenues from Encore Boston Harbor to rise 6.4% year over year (to $223.5 million) in the second quarter.The emphasis on development projects (including incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities) and increased sign-ups (to Wynn Rewards loyalty program) have been a catalyst for Wynn Resorts.

CPI and jobless claims will be released Thursday and the PPI and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index will be released on Friday, giving investors a better sense of the state of the economy. On the earnings front, several companies are set to report results. Paramount (PARA) and Disney (DIS) will be reporting amid the ongoing Hollywood strikes. Lucid (LCID), Rivian (RIVN), and Honda's (HMC) results will give investors a look into the automotive industry. Investors will also hear from UPS (UPS), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Lyft (LYFT), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), and Krispy Kreme (DNUT) this week. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down what to watch for the week ahead.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: So the start of the economic calendar this week is a little bit slower. That small biz optimism print tomorrow will be interesting to take a look at as well as mortgage applications. We've been following housing obviously very closely. But CPI and inflation on Thursday is the print that I think we are all most excited for.Right now, economists surveyed by Bloomberg are actually projecting that CPI in July grew at 3.3%. Those prices grew at 3.3%. That would be an increase from 3% in June. So I think it could be a big week for the last mile conversation, if you will, and get into that running analogy. But essentially saying that the last mile of inflation down to 2% is going to take longer than we've seen it from 9% to 3% in a year. So I think that's going to be an interesting thing to watch on Thursday.And then on Friday, we're going to hear how consumers are feeling about that inflation story. You remember, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment report that we covered pretty extensively last time because it was such a big pop. Americans are feeling more confident about the economy. Actually came before we saw that 3% inflation report. So I'm interested to see what we hear from consumers on Friday, at least on the economic side this week, guys.Story continues- All right, glad we've got a new analogy at least to use for the meantime. No more-- so well, we're still talking about soft landing, I guess we just did a second ago. Now we're running analogy too.JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, yes, I like the last mile, right?- Yeah, what about earnings?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, we've got some earnings this week too. Only 34 companies in the S&amp;P 500 reporting, so a little bit softer this week. But a couple of key ones specifically tonight that I'm excited for, when you take a look at Palantir and Paramount, two stories we've been following closely is, of course, that AI bubble and how companies are reacting, the stock is reacting to what they say about AI.Palantir sort of fits into that bill of a company that's promising AI to be coming to the company in the future, not necessarily right now. So I'm curious to see if they move off that. Paramount, you remember, moved roughly 30% last quarter on earnings.

And of course, Disney, on Wednesday, will be a big, big story to watch what's going on with Disney. People are always interested in what Bob Iger says. I'm sure Alexandra Canal is going to write four or five different stories on it. We're going to break down all the different angles. ESPN is going to talk, we're going to hear what they have to say about ESPN specifically for the first time. I'm excited.- I am excited too. And UPS which you mentioned usually is a bellwether.

The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.29 billion, up 10.6% year over year.Factors to NoteThe company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to benefit from strength in Admissions, and Food and Beverage revenues.

(NYSE:ZTS) today reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2023 and updated its guidance for full year 2023.The company reported revenue of $2.2 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6% compared with the second quarter of 2022. On an operational1 basis, revenue for the second quarter of 2023 increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $671 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, an increase of 27% and 29%, respectively, on a reported basis.Adjusted net income2 for the second quarter of 2023 was $652 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, an increase of 15% and 18%, respectively, on a reported basis. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2023 excludes the net favorable impact of $19 million for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items.EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY""Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income, based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species,"" said Kristin Peck, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. ""As expected, we returned to more balanced segment growth, with 11% operational revenue growth internationally and 7% revenue growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. Our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products.""Story continues""With the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income. We expect continued strong growth in the second half, led by our companion animal portfolio. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable, underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human-animal bond, people’s willingness to spend on pet health, and the essential need for a safe and secure food supply. I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance thanks to our purpose-driven colleagues, innovation-driven culture and diverse portfolio that continue to drive our success.""QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTSZoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two segments: United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for companion animals and livestock, tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the second quarter of 2023:Revenue in the U.S. segment was $1.165 billion, an increase of 7% compared with the second quarter of 2022. Sales of companion animal products increased 7%, driven by the company’s key dermatology portfolio including Apoquel® and Cytopoint®. Also contributing to growth in the quarter were the company’s vaccine portfolio and Solensia®, a monoclonal antibody product for osteoarthritis pain in cats. Sales of livestock products increased 5% in the quarter. Sales of cattle products increased primarily due to increased sales of Draxxin®, resulting from a favorable comparable quarter versus the prior year, and sales of the implant product Synovex®. Growth in the company’s poultry portfolio was due to increased sales of vaccines and medicated feed additives (MFAs). Sales of swine products declined modestly in the quarter, primarily due to decreased disease prevalence.Revenue in the International segment was $995 million, an increase of 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally compared with the second quarter of 2022. Sales of companion animal products grew 13% on a reported basis and 17% operationally. Growth in the quarter was driven by the company’s parasiticide portfolio, including Revolution®/Stronghold® and Simparica Trio®, its monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain — Librela® for dogs and Solensia® for cats, as well as its key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of livestock products declined 1% on a reported basis and grew 4% operationally. Growth in the company’s poultry portfolio was driven by key account penetration and rotation of medicated feed additives in core poultry markets, including Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Growth in the company’s fish portfolio was the result of increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, primarily Norway and Chile. Sales of cattle products grew primarily due to pricing in hyperinflationary markets and supply recovery, partially offset by unfavorable market conditions in some key and emerging markets. Sales of swine products declined as a result of supply constraints in Western Europe.INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITYZoetis continues to advance pain management and dermatology innovation for dogs. Since its last quarterly earnings announcement, the company received U.S. approval for Librela (bedinvetmab), the first and only injectable monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment for the control of canine osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Librela is also approved in the European Union (EU), Canada, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Australia and other international markets. Additionally, Zoetis received U.S. approval for Apoquel Chewable (oclacitinib chewable tablet) for the control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and control of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Previously approved in the EU, Mexico, Australia, Canada, Japan and other international markets, Apoquel Chewable is the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs in the U.S.In Diagnostics, the company enhanced its Vetscan® product line with the announcement of Vetscan Mastigram+, which will be launching in markets around the world in the second half of 2023. This rapid, on-farm mastitis diagnostic enables farmers and veterinarians to deliver more targeted therapies for dairy cows, enabling more judicious use of antimicrobials.In June, Zoetis published its 2022 Sustainability Report, describing the company’s progress toward achieving its Driven to Care long-term sustainability aspirations and continued disclosure on environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. The report highlights achievements toward the company’s journey to advance sustainability in animal health through specific actions that support Communities, Animals and the Planet.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEZoetis is updating its full year reported 2023 guidance due to foreign exchange rates and a one-time gain from a business development deal.Updates revenue to between $8.500 billion to $8.650 billion (maintains operational growth of 6% to 8%)Updates reported net income to between $2.400 billion to $2.460 billionUpdates adjusted net income to between $2.500 billion to $2.550 billion (maintains operational growth of 7% to 9%)Updates reported diluted EPS of $5.15 to $5.27 due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a one-time gain from a business development dealUpdates adjusted diluted EPS between $5.37 to $5.47 due to the impact of foreign exchange ratesThis guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July.

Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, adjusted R&amp;D expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions-net are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.(c) We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period.(d) Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to acquisitions and other charges.ZOETIS INC.CONSOLIDATED REVENUE BY SEGMENT(a) AND SPECIES(UNAUDITED)(millions of dollars)Three Months EndedJune 30,% Change20232022TotalForeignExchangeOperational(b)Revenue:Companion Animal$1,489$1,3669%(2)%11%Livestock671668—%(4)%4%Contract Manufacturing &amp;

(NYSE: NRG) today reported second quarter 2023 results.""NRG had a solid second quarter with strong financial results and excellent progress on our strategic priorities. Our plants performed well during this period of record peak demand, and we continued to grow our customers and margins,"" said Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We are advancing our consumer strategy and delivering on our commitments. NRG is well-positioned to create significant shareholder value capitalizing on the convergence of energy and smart technologies in the home.""Quarterly Financial ResultsNRG reported second quarter 2023 Net Income of $308 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $819 million, Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $570 million, and Free Cash Flow Before Growth Investments (FCFbG) was $425 million.NRG Strategic DevelopmentsEnhanced Operating Efficiency and Growth Initiatives - $300 Million Growth and $250 Million Cost Savings Plan Through 2025During its June 2023 Investor Day, NRG provided a strategic update on its consumer services strategy. NRG is positioned to fully capitalize on its market leadership and approximately 7.5 million residential customer base. NRG's enhanced consumer services platform is creating new, high-margin recurring revenue streams while extending customer tenure and reach. Through a combination of cross-selling, bundling, and organic growth, NRG expects to achieve $300 million of incremental FCFbG by 2025. Given the positive results of various initiatives to date, the Company is increasing the growth plan’s 2023 contribution to FCFbG to $60 million, from $30 million.Story continuesReflecting the Company's focus on cost discipline and operational excellence, NRG in June announced an additional $150 million cost reduction program that is expected to be completed by 2025, derived from operations and maintenance efficiencies, sourcing optimization, automation, service levels, and spans of control. This $150 million cost reduction program is incremental to the $100 million in cost synergies related to the Vivint Smart Home acquisition and totals $250 million in cost savings by 2025. Additionally, NRG expects to complete its $300 million in Direct Energy cost synergies program by the end of 2023.Revised Capital Allocation FrameworkIn June 2023, having line-of-sight to its investment needs following the Vivint Smart Home acquisition, NRG revised its long-term capital allocation policy to target allocating approximately 80% of cash available for allocation after debt reduction to be returned to shareholders. As part of the revised capital allocation framework, the Board of Directors approved an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion to be executed through 2025. NRG has executed $50 million in share repurchases in July 2023.Also in June 2023, NRG provided visibility in achieving its target investment grade credit metrics of 2.50-2.75x net debt / adjusted corporate EBITDA by 2025, allocating up to $2.55 billion of capital available for allocation to debt reduction. As part of this plan, the Company expects to reduce its debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 with $900 million funded with cash from operations and $500 million with proceeds from the sale of STP. As of July 31, 2023, the Company executed $200 million in debt reduction.On July 17, 2023, NRG announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.3775 per share. The dividend is payable on August 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of August 1, 2023.NRG's share repurchase program and common stock dividend are subject to maintaining satisfactory credit metrics, available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations. The timing and amount of any shares of NRG’s common stock that are repurchased under the share repurchase authorization will be determined by NRG’s management based on market conditions and other factors. NRG will only repurchase shares when management believes it would not jeopardize the company’s ability to maintain satisfactory credit ratings.W.A. Parish OutageIn May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to the steam turbine/generator. Based on work completed to date, the Company expects to return the unit to service in late August 2023. NRG expects lost revenues and expenditures incurred in 2023 to be offset by insurance recoveries.Sale of 44% Equity Interest in the South Texas Project (STP)On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 44% equity interest in STP for $1.75 billion, unlocking significant shareholder value. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and is expected to close by the end of 2023.Year in Review, Including 13th Annual Sustainability UpdateNRG released its 2022 Year in Review, including its 13th year of sustainability reporting, providing an update on the Company’s dedication to people, commitment to environmental stewardship, and governance. The report highlights a record year of safety performance and customer retention, as well as many initiatives that reflect NRG's commitment to employee well-being and community. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, NRG recorded an approximately 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2014 base year and a 60% decrease in revenue carbon intensity since 2020.1 Adjusted to reflect the sale of Vivint Smart Home's Canada business, which was completed in June 2022Consolidated Financial ResultsThree Months EndedSix Months Ended($ in millions)6/30/20236/30/20226/30/20236/30/2022Net Income/(Loss)$308$513$(1,027)$2,249Cash Provided/(Used) by Operating Activities$570$1,513$(1,028)$3,189Adjusted EBITDA$819$386$1,465$922Free Cash Flow Before Growth Investments (FCFbG)$425$97$628$336Segments ResultsTable 1: Net Income/(Loss)($ in millions)Three Months EndedSix Months EndedSegment6/30/20236/30/20226/30/20236/30/2022Texas$785$762$1,069$1,533East(101)(12)(1,503)1,526West/Services/Othera(353)(237)(531)(810)Vivint Smart Homeb$(23)N/A$(62)N/ANet Income/(Loss)$308$513$(1,027)$2,249Includes Corporate segmentVivint Smart Home acquired in March 2023Net Income for the second quarter was $205 million lower than the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by lower mark-to-market non-cash gains on economic hedge positions in Texas and the East. Net Loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.0 billion, $3.3 billion lower than the prior year. This was driven by unrealized mark-to-market non-cash losses on economic natural gas and power hedges in the first quarter of 2023. Certain hedge positions are required to be marked-to-market every period, while the customer contracts related to these items are not, resulting in temporary unrealized non-cash losses or gains on the economic hedges that are not reflective of the expected economics at future settlement.Table 2: Adjusted EBITDA($ in millions)Three Months EndedSix Months EndedSegment6/30/20236/30/20226/30/20236/30/2022Texas$504$263$758$474East7768391400West/Services/Othera21552648Vivint Smart Homeb$217N/A$290N/AAdjusted EBITDA$819$386$1,465$922Includes Corporate segmentVivint Smart Home acquired in March 2023Texas: Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $504 million, $241 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by lower retail supply costs, including the impact of lower power pricing, the diversified supply strategy, and improved plant performance coupled with the 2022 impact of the W.A. Parish Unit 8 extended outage. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in retail load and higher operating costs due to an increase in planned outages in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022.East: Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million, $9 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased retail power margins, partially offset by asset retirements and lower retail natural gas margins.West/Services/Other: Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $21 million, $34 million lower than the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by lower contributions from the services businesses and Cottonwood.Vivint Smart Home: Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million in the second quarter of 2023.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesTable 3: Corporate Liquidity($ in millions)6/30/2312/31/22Cash and Cash Equivalents$422$430Restricted Cash2640Total448470Total Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities4,0672,324Total Liquidity, excluding collateral deposited by counterparties$4,515$2,794As of June 30, 2023, NRG's cash was $422 million, and $4.1 billion was available under the Company’s credit facilities.

This increase was due to specific initiatives to optimize the amount of collateral supporting NRG's market operations activity and increases in credit facilities.2023 GuidanceNRG is reaffirming its Adjusted EBITDA, Cash provided by operating activities, and FCFbG guidance for 2023 as set forth below.Table 4: Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Provided by Operating Activities, and FCFbG Guidancea2023(In millions)GuidanceAdjusted EBITDA$3,010 - $3,250Cash Provided by Operating Activities$1,610 - $1,850FCFbG$1,620 - $1,860Non-GAAP financial measure; see Appendix Table A-8 for GAAP Reconciliation from Net Income to FCFbG.

Parish Unit 8 and Limestone Unit 1 expected insurance recoveries related to property, plant and equipment.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.EBITDA represents net income before interest expense (including loss on debt extinguishment), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset retirement obligation expenses, contract amortization consisting of amortization of power and fuel contracts and amortization of emission allowances. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; andOther companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of customer acquisition costs (primarily amortized commissions), impairment losses, deactivation costs, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from forward position of economic hedges, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items, plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance.Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show cash Cash provided/(used) by operating activities with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration, related restructuring costs, changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability, and the impact of extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of Cash provided/(used) by operating activities because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing Cash Flows from Operating Activities and they are fully disclosed to investors. The company excludes changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability as these amounts are offset by changes in the decommissioning fund shown in Cash Flows from Investing Activities.Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding and insurance recoveries related to property, plant and equipment, dividends from preferred instruments treated as debt by ratings agencies, and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is a performance measure and is not intended to represent Net Income/(Loss), Cash provided/(used) by operating activities (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230807792982/en/ContactsMedia: Laura Avant713.537.5437Investors: Brendan Mulhern609.524.4767]"

Now, there could be a counterintuitive shift: Surging new-vehicle supply could further boost expansion of the used-vehicle fleet, bringing more high-mileage vehicles into service bays.How is this possible? The aging car parc has already expanded the repair business sweet spot, which we consider as vehicles from six to 11 years old. Now 12- and 13-year-old vehicles are becoming a bigger part of the business - even though they were originally sold during the slow-sales years of the Great Recession.Annual VIO by vehicle age groupGrowth in vehicle age won't be uniform. While the share of 7-year-old vehicles in operation is expected to decline through 2028, vehicles more than eight years old will swell in number, said Todd Campau, associate director for aftermarket solutions for S&amp;P Global Mobility. That age group is expected to grow by more than 25 million units by 2028, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility projections.""As vehicles with more electronic sophistication continue to age and increase in overall share, the aftermarket's role in maintaining the aging vehicle fleet will become increasingly critical,"" Campau said. ""That's where the real opportunity is in the aftermarket space.""In addition, drivers of older, lower-priced, out-of-warranty vehicles are likely to drive more miles, because they may have jobs without a work-from-home option. During the pandemic years, vehicles from six to 13 years old - the new aftermarket sweet spot - will increase their share of annual miles traveled, outstripping both vehicles zero to 5-years-old and 14-years-plus, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility projections.Story continuesWeighted mileage share by age groupSupply chain, inventory, and macroeconomics fuel disparityFor several years, pandemic-related supply-chain headaches have kept automotive production below demand. Light vehicle sales of 13.8 million in the US in 2022 - the lowest in a decade - were a key factor boosting the average vehicle age to 12.5 years.The situation wasn't entirely unwelcome for automakers and dealers. Automakers shifted their production mix to high-ticket, high-margin vehicles. At the same time, tight inventories meant that dealers could sell new vehicles quickly to desperate shoppers willing to pay sticker prices - or higher.Now that's changing, Campau said. It was expected that as the availability of components like semiconductor chips improved, new vehicle sales would increase, slowing the rate of used vehicle growth. S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts 15.4 million light vehicle sales in the U.S. this year, followed by 15.8 million in 2024 and 16.5 million in 2025, based on its July forecast.US Light Vehicle Sales OutlookBut the consumer side of the equation remains a little shaky, despite some positive macroeconomic signs. Lingering inflation and high interest rates are expected to weaken the recovery of new vehicle demand just as inventory increases. The market is transitioning from being supply-constrained to being demand-constrained, Campau said.One key indicator: Demand for auto loans has slipped below third-quarter 2020 levels, according to analysis by S&amp;P Global Mobility and TransUnion.The question now, Campau noted, is whether OEMs will start building more economy or mid-priced vehicles and trims to provide affordable options to middle- and lower-income families currently trapped in a used-vehicle spiral, or if automakers will stick with a mix that favors higher-margin vehicles.""Will the consumers continue to support that premium model?"" Campau said. ""The question is who's going to blink first?""Of course, automakers can always stimulate demand by the age-old method of piling on incentives. The market is already starting to see increased incentives as new vehicle inventories have risen this year, he says. But spiffs are still at less than half of pre-pandemic levels. That said, price cuts by Tesla and Ford on their respective EV lines show that inventory concerns are growing.Older cars becoming trickier to fixAll of this suggests that a growing used-vehicle fleet will continue to benefit the aftermarket business. But while aftermarket repair shops should see more business coming in the door, they face new challenges.The vehicles in their service bays will be increasingly loaded with sensors for infotainment, communications, and advanced driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and collision avoidance. Adaptive cruise, in particular, has been on a steady upward penetration trend since 2015; it is projected to be in nearly 70 percent of model-year 2023 vehicles, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates.""I think sensors are where the next big opportunity is for the aftermarket,"" Campau said. Likewise, as 5G connectivity becomes dominant in new vehicles, a growing share of vehicles in operation will be capable of receiving over-the-air (OTA) software updates. By 2028, S&amp;P Global Mobility projects, more than one-third of vehicles in operation will be connected, with more than 95 percent of those OTA-ready.As the used vehicle parc grows in technological sophistication, right-to-repair issues will come to the fore, as automakers wrestle with wanting to maintain control over intellectual property while their service bays become more crowded.""For consumers, the option to have the choice to maintain their vehicle in a timely fashion where convenient will be increasingly important,"" Campau said. ""The volume of the vehicle fleet will make cooperation between OE aftersales service and aftermarket service shops a requirement to keep the nearly 300 million-vehicle population working as safely and efficiently as possible.""About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

KingThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we review the results, I'd like to start out by discussing my vision for Tyson and the decisive actions that we are taking to successfully navigate the current market environment.We remain fully committed to our vision of delivering sustainable top line growth and margin improvement over the long run. With our leadership team, we are executing a multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization, including taking a much closer look at our cost structure across the business to drive operational excellence. We are already seeing tangible benefits of our efforts. We've been through market cycles before, and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to emerge stronger from this one.We are making good progress and saw sequential improvements in our results in Q3. We're not yet where we need to be so we continue to focus on what we can control. Earlier today, we announced our intention to close 4 more of our chicken facilities, demonstrating our commitment to taking bold actions to improve performance.Beyond these important actions, I remain optimistic about our future. We are a leader in our industry, and we continue to innovate and take market share in most of our categories. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy, and we are leaving no stone unturned to maximize value for shareholders.Diving into our results. We continue to compare against strong performance across our segments last year. However, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements we've made in Q3.Let me start with chicken. Market conditions in chicken are still challenged with commodity prices across most cuts remaining significantly lower compared to last year. However, adjusted operating income improved by more than $100 million sequentially without any material benefits of market tailwinds.The sequential increase was primarily due to internal actions we took. For example, in our fiscal Q2, we decided to close 2 of our plants, convert 2 others to boneless and rationalize our SKUs, inventory and other assets. In Q3, the team made significant improvements in yield, spend and efficiency, leading to strong improvement in profitability in just 1 quarter.As we become more productive with automation and team member engagement, we can further optimize our footprint and reallocate resources to more efficient plants while still having ample capacity to service and grow with our customers. This enabled us to announce today that we plan to close 4 additional chicken facilities, bringing the total announced closures to 6 this year.We also recently made the decision to transition away from the no-antibiotics-ever labeling for Tyson-branded chicken to a ""no antibiotics important for human medicine"" approach. Data suggests the use of ionophores can lead to more uniform birds with consistent weight. In turn, we can more accurately forecast supply and demand, helping to meet the needs of our customers and consumers.And I want to emphasize that we will continue to evaluate all options, including more actions like these across all of our businesses. In beef, we performed better than expected. Our results were driven by our disciplined approach to balancing supply with customer demand while taking advantage of seasonal increases in cutout values.However, the beef industry will likely continue facing headwinds. As you may have seen in the latest USDA cattle inventory report, herd liquidation continues to tighten supply, leading to higher cattle cost, narrowing spreads and difficult export market conditions. Pork remains under pressure across the industry, and we continue to see headwinds there with both our internal live production and our external sourced hog supply, increased feed cost and low cutouts drove spread compression through our results. We also had incremental negative impacts in Q3 from a fire at one of our processing facilities.Finally, to Prepared Foods, which is a key growth pillar for the future. The business performed well in Q3. In retail, our core business lines saw strong volume growth in the quarter and continued to gain pound and dollar share.In broadline foodservice, Tyson Focus 6 continues to outpace the industry in volume growth. This led to better-than-anticipated margins in Prepared Foods. In short, our results this quarter demonstrate that Chicken is gaining momentum, and our branded foods business remains an area of strength.Let me add some further color on the performance of our branded business versus our top peers. As I mentioned earlier, our Tyson core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth up 5% versus a year ago. We believe this points to the strength of our core brands and sets us up well for the future.We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate and across dayparts. Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. Our share performance and brand strength demonstrate the momentum we've gained with consumers, and they will continue to spend on brands they know and trust. Likewise, we will continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands.While we are pleased with our brand strength and share performance, we are constantly building new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. Over the past few years, our innovations have generated roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Let me highlight a few products we've launched this fiscal year that I'm most excited about.Earlier this year, we announced the Tyson Original Chicken Breast Sandwich for retail channel, which won the People Magazine Food Award for Best frozen sandwich. Furthermore, we were excited to see that more than 70% of the buyers were new to the Tyson brand and more than 20% were new to the category.We also launched Tyson chicken sandwiches in food service space, where our sandwiches won awards from Food and Beverage Industry, National Agri-Marketing Association and National Association of Convenience Stores. As you can see, our innovation in chicken is able to be deployed across channels and occasions, highlighting the power of our scale.Moving to Jimmy Dean, which is already a clear leader in the breakfast meal occasion. We're expanding with differentiated capability-based innovation by launching handheld breakfast items. For instance, this year, we launched the Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-ups in foodservice channel and Maple Griddle Cakes and Toaster Pop-ups in retail. We are seeing strong customer adoption of these products and promising early consumer demand.In Hillshire Farm, one area of focus in retail has been the trend towards healthy snacking. For instance, we launched Hillshire Farm Snack Kits with 100% real premium meats, cheeses and crackers, all ready to eat on the go. If you haven't already, I encourage you to try our Snack Kits like oven-roasted turkey breast, cheddar cheese and wheat crackers. We launched these products at attractive price points and have already seen strong acceptance with major retail customers.In the foodservice channel, we are now participating in the fast-growing Cupping Pepperoni category with our very own Hillshire-branded Cupping Pepperoni product. We are always on the lookout for how to keep our brands on trend across channels.Now I'll turn things over to John to review our financial results for the quarter in more detail.John R. TysonThank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down 2.6% year-over-year driven by pork and chicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in our Beef and Chicken segments.Higher input cost per pound was primarily due to the increase in cattle costs along with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor costs, but these were partially offset by lower hog costs, reduced outside purchases of meat in our Chicken segment and lower raw material costs in Prepared Foods. While profit was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it improved meaningfully versus last quarter, and adjusted EPS increased $0.19 on a sequential basis. Challenges remain, but we continue to improve efficiencies by controlling what we can and believe we're heading in the right direction.Now on to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. In Beef, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down, primarily reflecting higher cattle costs, which increased $610 million on a like per pound basis. Operating margin of 1.6% was down from the historically strong margins of more than 10% in Q3 last year.On a sequential basis, disciplined yield and procurement benefits, along with seasonal cutout improvement, helped drive better-than-expected operating profits. Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, and we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is well underway.Now moving to Pork. Revenue was down 18% driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer demand. The operating loss in the quarter was $70 million as spread compression continued to pressure our margins. This was exacerbated by market pressures in our live operations, lower exports and the operational impact of the fire at our Madison facility.Moving on to Chicken now. Sales declined 3.5% year-on-year driven by lower pricing, partially offset by volume growth. The decrease in pricing reflects the challenging commodity market. While volume grew modestly versus last year, it decreased more than 4% on a sequential basis. This sequential decline is more than historical seasonality, reflecting steps we took to align internal production to consumer demand while also reducing finished good inventory by $70 million.Year-over-year profitability was negatively impacted by market conditions and higher feed costs and a $65 million net derivative loss in the current quarter compared to a $23 million loss in the prior year period. On a sequential basis, it's worth noting that AOI improved by more than $100 million.In Prepared Foods, sales declined 2.6% driven by both volume and price. The volume decline was driven by foodservice as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains a little uneven. As Donnie mentioned, our Focus 6 categories are outpacing broadline industry and maintaining their share. Our lower foodservice volumes were partially offset by continued growth in retail, highlighting the strength of our brands.Lower pricing was primarily driven by lower bacon prices, reflecting the underlying cutout values for bellies. Compared to the prior year period, operating profit was up $34 million due to lower raw material costs and productivity gains, which was partially offset by lower sales, higher packaging costs and increased MAP investments.Despite increased spending in brand-building efforts, we were pleased with our operating margin of 9.2%, particularly so given the challenging retail food environment. Our Prepared Foods segment remains key to our strategy, providing a high-margin, stable business with many growth opportunities ahead, helping to offset the pressures and volatility in commodity prices.Before moving on to balance sheet items, I want to provide some context on the goodwill impairment charge that impacted our reported numbers on a GAAP basis. The details of which will be provided in our 10-Q when we file it later this week.The interim impairment testing we did this quarter resulted in noncash charges in the reporting units that we have been disclosing as at risk in our filings going back to last fiscal year. The impacts of the charges are not shown in our presentation this morning as they are not reflected in our adjusted results, but all reconciliations to reported results can be found in the appendix.Now to our financial position and capital priorities. We're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. Q3 operating cash flow was $660 million, in line with expectations with prudent working capital management partially offsetting lower profitability. Inventory reduction was the primary driver of improved core working capital. We still see some opportunity to improve inventory days and drive better cash flow.Year-to-date, CapEx is roughly $1.6 billion as we continue to moderate our pace of spending. Based on this pace, we don't expect CapEx to exceed $2.1 billion, below our prior guidance of $2.3 billion.We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 3.2x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term.During Q3, we returned $167 million to shareholders via dividends and $11 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.Now let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. We're maintaining our total company sales guidance range of $53 billion to $54 billion, and we expect to be at the lower end with roughly flat sales growth for the year.Turning to AOI. In Beef, based on our year-to-date results, offset by anticipated live cattle cutout spread compression, we expect full year margins to be at the higher end of our range of between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.For Pork, due to ongoing market dynamics impacting our Pork segment, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 4% and a loss of 2%, but at the higher end of that range.In Chicken, we're gaining momentum. But with our results year-to-date, including net derivative losses, we expect full year margins to be at the lower end of our range of between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.Prepared Foods has generated strong margins throughout the year. With continued investment to support our brands, we expect margins to be at the higher end of the 8% to 10% range for fiscal 2023. And as I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.1 billion.Our expectations for net interest expense and tax rate remain unchanged at around $340 million and 22%, respectively.So in summary, while the current operating environment is difficult in several of our businesses, we are making improvements across our operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term growth opportunities. We have great teams across our segments. We've got growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.So now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&amp;A instructions.Sean T. CornettThanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&amp;A. Operator, please provide the Q&amp;A instructions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from Alexia Howard from AllianceBernstein.Alexia Jane Burland HowardSo there's obviously a lot of moving pieces here on the quarter. Could we maybe take a step back and get your overall take on the quarter and where we're at in the recovery of your commodity meat segments? Just trying to put things into context here. And then I have a follow-up.Donnie D. KingOkay. Well, Alexia, this is Donnie King. Let me start out with thanking you for the question. And as is no surprise, markets continue to be challenging, and they're challenging for everyone. I will tell you that we continue to execute our strategy. And I would tell you, we've had the best execution in our Q3 that we've had since prepandemic times.In Q3, we saw a sequential improvement across all businesses so led by Chicken as well as -- led by chicken as we focused on our cost structure. We have aligned our supply to our demand as we pursue profitable growth. We are controlling the controllables across all businesses.I would tell you that we're not surprised by Beef and Pork results. We expected it. We are happy to report that we're winning with customers and consumers and gaining volume and dollar share. We are taking decisive actions, as we talked about this morning, rightsizing and modernizing our footprint. We continue to invest in automation and digitalization. We continue to invest in our team members and their work experience.We are pursuing growth in value-added and branded categories. In Chicken, behind the #1 brand in chicken, Tyson; in Prepared Foods behind Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, we are #1 in 8 of 9 categories we compete in at retail. We hold #1 or #2 positions in most foodservice categories.And as I said this morning, we will continue to evaluate everything we do.Tyson has been around since 1935, and I've been around since the early '80s, and we've seen many cycles before. We always come out better, stronger and faster, and we will this time as well. That said, we have more to do, and we're excited about our future. Our leadership team and our 140,000 team members are aligned to maximizing shareholder value. That's a little bit of color.Let me flip it over to Brady, and he can speak to a little bit around the Pork and Beef business.Brady StewartSure. Thanks, Donnie. First of all, on the Pork -- in our Pork business, I think it's important to break the Pork business into 2 different segments. First, as John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, we faced some challenges relative to the economics in the Pork business, specific with live operations. It's well documented that the pork industry is in the midst of a liquidation cycle right now. We believe that the markets will, in fact, take care of themselves. But over half of our losses in the quarter were attributable to live ops and price discovery relative to live ops with some of our suppliers.Fresh pork, on the other hand, the other half of that segment, was impacted by the fire we had in Madison. And outside of that, we saw strong improvement in terms of operational execution in our Pork business. We're excited about the team that we've assembled here in Springdale and believe we have a bright future in front of us as we continue to execute on those operations.On the Beef side, we'll continue to focus on what we can control relative to moving through this beef cycle. We're going to continue to align our supply with demand and drive value-added, including case-ready, to make sure that we continue to be closer to our customer and try to decommoditize that business. Thanks for the question.Alexia Jane Burland HowardGreat. And then if I go back to year, I mean, this time last year, you were looking for strong and speedy recovery in the Chicken margins based on improved hatch rates and capacity utilization. Obviously, there was the hiccup over the holidays with the forecasting error, but it seems as though the environment has changed materially. What has changed in the environment? And how quickly do you think you can get back on track on the Chicken side of the business?Donnie D. KingThank you, Alexia. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in 3Q and especially in June. As -- we have much work left to do, but we're on the right path. And I think that's important to call out. We're controlling the controllables better than before, and I mentioned earlier that the best I've seen in terms of execution since prepandemic.But let me flip that over to Wes and let him add a little bit more color on chicken.Wes MorrisYes, sure. I too am encouraged by the sequential improvement. The team is focused on what they do day in and day out. And we've seen a big step change in improving yields, labor efficiency, line efficiency and spend. And at the same time, we've seen great improvement in order fill and on-time delivery.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuSo I want to start on the Chicken business. Donnie, you noted the sequential improvement in the business. You also called out the actions you took to close 4 facilities. I recognize not all of those are large-scale harvest facilities, but I do think there's some sizable facilities in that footprint. So could you talk a little bit about what the net impact to production might look like as you layer some of that production into the rest of your facilities and then think about what the go-forward looks like?Donnie D. KingSure, Ben. I'll add a few comments, and I'll flip it to Wes to add a little more color. In terms of the plant closings, closing plants is never easy for anyone involved. In fact, it can be gut-wrenching. But I would tell you with a great deal of gratitude and thanks to our team members, our family farmers and the communities impacted, we made those decisions.And earlier today, we announced the closure of the 4 plants, bringing the total to 6 this year. The facilities that we are closing, just to give a little color about them, they're typically smaller in scale and in need of major capital to make them viable. And so that's an important detail. And I'll flip it over to Wes to give you a little color on the capacity.Wes MorrisYes, Ben, I would answer it simply this way: we're moving our existing sales to more efficient assets. And so no material change in volume in any way, shape or form in excess of 90% once implemented.John R. TysonBen, this is John, if I can just add in a little bit because I think you're trying to ask what's the impact on these moves. So you heard Donnie talk about adjusting the need for capital investment in some of the older facilities. We see that as a benefit with these moves.I think, number two, we're talking about taking out around 10% of harvest capacity, which puts our asset utilization when all things are said and done, up closer to that 90% out of the low 80s. And not just talking about the asset closures, but when you think about the asset closures, the NAE to NAIHM move and some other operational changes that we're making we've talked a lot about last year around mix, et cetera, we would expect somewhere around a $200 million run rate uplift from those moves. And so exactly when all that comes to fruition in the end of '23 and '24, we can't pay it all to 1 day. But that's kind of order of magnitude what we're talking about here.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. That's very helpful. Maybe thinking about the Pork business. You noted the facility fire impact in the quarter. We have been seeing the cutout rally pretty materially. So kind of a 2-part question. One, I know despite the guide down for the balance of the year in Pork, how would you expect Port packer margins to migrate as we move through the rest of this year? And then two, as you've seen some of the cutout costs prices that rally pretty materially, what impact does that have to cost of goods sold on the Prepared Foods business as well?Donnie D. KingSo Ben, if I could make a couple of comments and I'll let Brady add color too, Q3 was challenging, and we expected it to be. But as Brady mentioned earlier, we are absolutely laser-focused on those things in which we can control.I'll let Brady, if you would, speak to from the hog side as well as from a Pork perspective.Brady StewartSure. Thanks, Donnie. I think there's a number of things at play here that we'll continue to evaluate as we learn more about these markets. And obviously, one of the biggest impacts relative to the supply-demand equation that we've seen in the last several months is the Supreme Court's ruling on Proposition 12. I think as an industry, we're still learning what total impact that has from a supply-demand perspective. I think it's somewhat difficult right now to totally forecast with great accuracy how that all plays out, coupled with the fact that, as I referenced earlier, we're in the midst of a -- liquidation cycle as well in the industry.We're going to continue to monitor these macroeconomic factors that impact our business. But let me be clear, we have the opportunity to continue to control the controllables, continue to use our footprint with our case-ready and value-added assets to get closer to the consumer. And I feel good with the team that we have here in Springdale, who stood up to manage the Pork business and are seeing significant operational improvements in that business.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.Peter Thomas GalboDonnie, maybe we can actually start on Beef. I think you said it came in better than you expected in the quarter, but again, your outlook here in 4Q, maybe a bit weaker. And I just wanted to give you a chance to talk about kind of how you see that business playing out over the next 18 months. Not asking for formal guidance, but I think the last time we were in this part of the beef cycle in '14 and '15, you went through an extended period where packer margins were actually negative. And is that -- within your consideration set, is that in your outlook? Just would be helpful to hear from you.Donnie D. KingSo Peter, let me start off with -- and we did, in fact, have a better quarter than expected. We were not surprised necessarily by the Beef results. As Brady has mentioned and John did in the opening remarks, we continue to see herd liquidation, but we are focused on what we can control.Let me flip it over to John and let him add some commentary around this.John R. TysonPeter, yes, just regarding your question on the outlook, I think a couple of things. So you did note, right, just on what the implications are with our guidance ranges on the balance of our '23, and we base that on dynamic market conditions. We're obviously being as intentional and aggressive as possible in trying to balance that supply and demand to manage the spread. But knowing what we know today, that's where things sit.As we think about '24, we expect to give you guidance in November, as has been customary for us in the past kind of annual cycles. But as it relates to making any projections or estimations about what the future looks like. As we move into the fall, we'll start to see some data around where pasture conditions were, what are the herd numbers looking like, what is the cow harvest. And I think from there, at that point in time, we might be able to make better projections about what '24 and '25 look like. And so I think that's probably as much as we can tell you on that today.Peter Thomas GalboNo, that's helpful, John, just kind of as we think about patch outs. And then maybe just back on Chicken, guys, just 2 questions -- or a 2-part question. First, with the 4 facilities you have today, are there any further anticipated impairments that you may have to take? Or kind of was that all contemplated today?And then secondly, maybe more broadly, Donnie, this mark-to-market hedging program in Chicken seems to kind of be an unexpected headwind a lot of quarters. Just curious, as you're reevaluating all parts of the business, I mean, is there a thought process on just unwinding the hedging program and kind of going to a more hand-and-out approach?Donnie D. KingSure. Thanks. Let me -- in terms of the plant closures, as I said earlier, we're continuing to evaluate everything as we automate and modernize these assets. And so we'll continue to look. I will tell you from an execution standpoint, again, performance was much better in Q3 and a lot of momentum moving into Q4 in our Chicken business.We're still growing with customers, and we still have capacity to be able to do that going forward. So -- but in terms of mark-to-market, I see it as well. We've talked about it a great deal and what the other options are for that in the business.Let me send it over to John and let him add a little color about that.John R. TysonYes. I think there are 2 questions in there: one around the impairments and one around the mark-to-market program. I think on the hedging program, look, we manage that -- try to manage for margin with -- for ourselves and as part of our relationship with our customers. We're always evaluating how we can do things different and better and recognize that it can create a little bit of noise in the numbers. But at this point in time, don't have any plans to change our approach on how we do that. That's number one.And then on the impairment, I think it's just worth pointing out, there was a goodwill impairment in our Chicken business in our Q3. But as it relates to these asset closures, the details of those charges would come through in our Q4. And we'll give a little more clarity on that as it relates to the asset impairments and the onetime cash costs, which all continue to get worked through as we just work through the details of the closure.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonSo maybe just continuing in Chicken. And John, you gave some helpful color on quantifying kind of the benefits from some of the plant closures and production shift. On the business, you quoted a $200 million kind of profit run rate. That would equate to, give or take, 110 or 120 basis points of margin at your current revenue levels.So as we think about where you're exiting fiscal '23 with the business in a loss position, the cumulative effect of those actions would get you to functionally marginal levels of profitability. So help us think about beyond that. So these are things you can control, and they get you slightly profitable. Is it really a market-dependent question on chicken demand has to improve chicken commodity, chicken pricing has to improve is what would actually get you to those historical 5%-plus margins that the company had been previously still aiming for longer term?John R. TysonYes, Adam, I think I would point out to a couple of things there. So first off, we're talking about the sequential improvements in operational execution. And more or less, you haven't seen market conditions materially change quarter-to-quarter. So I guess we just do emphasize that as a proof point that we're talking about execution, but holding the external data mostly static, we're starting to see that come through.And you did pick up correctly on the $200 million as kind of a run rate number. And again, when we talk about making the same amount of food in a smaller footprint, we do have some -- we have confidence in just what that cost elimination means from an overall profitability.We obviously are subject to where commodity markets move on both the input and the market side. So recovery there helps us as it does everyone in the industry. So we kind of focus on what's in our control. And I think beyond what I've just said, it's probably too early to issue any numbers for '24. We'll give a look at that when we get to the November call. So hopefully, that's somewhat more helpful than what you're looking for.Adam L. SamuelsonNo, it is. And I guess, though, if I think philosophically, historically, the company would always talk about profitability in Chicken and less volatility than the industry as a whole and not seeing the lows that others in the industry see not seeing the same highs. And I guess, not saying that others in the industry haven't seen real lows in the last 6 to 12 months. It's been a real challenge for the whole industry.I guess the historical model would have made us think that Tyson's Chicken business would be more resilient. So how do you -- how does the experience of the last year kind of inform how you would think about the Tyson's relative performance versus the industry and the margin potential of the business is currently constructed?John R. TysonI'll let Donnie comment on that one.Donnie D. KingAs I said earlier, Adam, we believe in Chicken, we're on the right path. I would tell you, it's the right path. We've been on that path for about 2 years now. And we've had a number of fits and starts from the breeder side to demand -- the demand picture. We're on our way to healing from a genetics perspective on the live side.In terms of our operations, they're performing better than they have. But then the third one, and it really impacted us in Q1 last year, is the demand picture that we struggled with getting a really accurate view of that. I would tell you the good news is in Q2, we were able to get that done. We actually started seeing benefit of that in Q3. And so we feel like we have a better picture of what the demand truly and consumption truly looks like. And that informs us again in terms of supply.And so we feel more balanced today than we have over the past 2 quarters. And the executional elements that we've talked about, we're obviously doing those a lot better than before. And then if you look at the bridge that you're trying to create basis your question, yes, there are some asset impairments. Yes, there are some plant closures. There's the typical labor yield and all those type things that we're managing. But we are doing every one of those things. And so I feel really good about where we are in Chicken and the path that we're on. And the future looks really good to me. John?John R. TysonYes. And Adam, I just want to add and emphasize something we already talked about, but I don't remember exactly how you asked your question, but something to the effect of, hey, what's different right now or looking backwards. And it's worth pointing out, I think we've taken pretty meaningful steps to get the cost structure back in balance. That includes the 2 closures back in the March time frame, the NAE move that we've talked about as well as these additional ones.So I think just pointing to that evidence and then when you look at quarter-over-quarter, market condition is the same. We're delivering on the operational execution. There are multiple proof points in the last, call it, 9 to 12 months that I think we are -- we believe, are indicative of the trajectory on this business.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.Andrew StrelzikMy first one is related to the chicken facility closures that you just announced. But I'm wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast the Chicken dynamics to what's going on in the Beef and Pork operating environment. You talked about controlling the controllables and utilization rates. And certainly, you talked about how difficult decisions are to close plants. But why does it make sense to do that in Chicken and not across your Beef and Pork businesses given the supply contraction that you're talking about?Donnie D. KingSure. Let me start out and remind you that I said we were looking at everything, and we are. And so I get your question around why not look at Beef and Pork. And again, I would tell you we are looking at everything in terms of how it works across the board.Fundamentally, we are focused on executional excellence across all businesses and functions at Tyson, including the overhead and cost structure at our corporate facilities. And so we're doing that well. I'm not saying -- I'm not telling you that we're not looking at Beef and Pork in the same manner that we have looked at Chicken. We're evaluating everything. And I think that's probably the biggest takeaway from that, but there was a -- the first part of that, there was a Chicken component.John R. TysonYes. I think the specific question was comparing Chicken to Beef here and how do you think about that. And I think -- look, there are multiple factors that go into making decisions like this. Asset efficiency and projected capital requirements are a big driver here. And when we talk about poultry today and we just think about the older kind of slower, less efficient assets compared to where we're moving the birds, we see that as a big uplift. And we make those same kind of evaluations across the whole network. In fact if I would make the comparison there.I think the other thing to point out, we've talked about this on previous calls, we are in this kind of special moment of facing headwinds in Chicken, Pork and Beef segment. The recovery time line in each of those is different. We would expect to see Chicken recover most quickly. Pork is a little different. And then the beef cycle and those dynamics, I think, are well documented. So it's just worth recalling attention to that, that we've discussed before.Donnie D. KingI would say this, John, as one final thought. As we think about Chicken and you mentioned, John, that Chicken would recover faster. And I think that's all true. But I think if you look at the Chicken business today versus where we were just a quarter ago, there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the Chicken business in the near to long term here.Andrew StrelzikGreat. That's really helpful color. And then I guess for my second question, I just wanted to go back to the change to the CapEx guidance for the year. Can you talk about more specifically the change there? And does it have any implication for '24 CapEx? And I guess, just generally, as you think about the flexibility of your CapEx budget, is there a way, given projects that are already underway, et cetera, to think about kind of a minimum CapEx budget for next year? I don't know if there's a way to frame that.John R. TysonThis is John. I'll take that question. Let me talk a little bit about CapEx and just kind of maybe some other related matters on the balance sheet and leverage. So I think, first off, we have pared back the CapEx kind of quarter-over-quarter. We've been managing the spend throughout the year, and we feel good about that.Based on our guidance today, you would expect to see about $500 million in Q4, which just worth pointing out that's still above what has been a historical annual run rate for us of about $1.5 billion. We are targeting to get to that $1.5 billion spend annually. And I think it would be premature to say where the '24 number lands, but safe to say that we're trending in that direction.I think it's also worth just taking a second to talk about where we are with leverage and -- because capital, obviously, the capital has been obviously influences that. I think the headline for us is we're sitting on a sound balance sheet, and that's really a product of the capital allocation choices we've made through the last few years, where we're really focused on kind of preserving a good financial position, targeting at or around that 2x leverage number for the long term.So leverage has increased with where profitability has been on an LTM basis. But I think overall, we feel good about where we are from being able to manage the capital spend standpoint and everything else that we've got going on.We've made a couple of moves, just tried to be tighter on working capital. We've pulled that down about $100 million in inventory this quarter just despite what's going on in the market. So I think overall, capital spend, working capital efficiency, all in line with that long-term leverage number have been. We're comfortable with where we sit today.OperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays.Benjamin M. TheurerNow consider that Pork margins after this [dilution], and you already commented on market conditions. Can you provide more light on company-specific initiatives, maybe some plant closures in Chicken, maybe that could be an auction? Anything else that you can provide towards improving operations there?John R. TysonBen, it's kind of hard to understand you. You're a little muffled. Do you mind repeating that question, sorry, because that was -- there was a lot in there?Benjamin M. TheurerSure on Pork margin, you already revised this and you mentioned the market conditions operational results. But can you provide more light on company-specific initiatives, maybe some plant closures? Could that be an option same as in chicken? Anything else on Pork profitability to improve that?Brady StewartThanks, Benjamin. This is Brady Stewart. Appreciate the question. As Donnie just indicated, we are evaluating our business in totality. And first and foremost, really, I think we need to unpack those Pork results back into the live and the actual fresh Pork segments that roll up to the specific BU. I'm going to speak specifically to our plants and operations from the fresh pork perspective.Very comfortable with our strategy moving forward. Obviously, from an impact perspective, we're focused on everything from our expenses and expense structure that we have within our assets. The efficiency of our assets, we have plans in place to make sure that we focus on better efficiency within those assets. And then obviously, traditional price yield and mix matrices that really provide us the opportunity to maximize the margins and our opportunity to go to market.So that's the approach we take. We feel very comfortable with the team we have in place. We'll feel very comfortable with the strategy that we have in place. I feel very comfortable from an operational execution perspective that we're making strides and improvements in that particular segment.Benjamin M. TheurerOkay. So no plant closures except Chicken, I guess?Brady StewartAs Donnie indicated earlier, we literally are evaluating everything. And that's both asset utilization, along with how we frame our strategy and our business moving forward, and we're comfortable with our approach as we move forward.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.Michael Scott LaveryI just wanted to come back to Chicken and how you think about, I guess, capacity. It's impressive to be able to cut some facilities and maintain the volume output. This is obviously from an efficiency standpoint. But I guess just given the industry supply and where pricing is so pressured, is there any rationalization or kind of reduction beyond that, that would make sense just given the market dynamics?John R. TysonSure. I think there's a couple of things to say on that. I mean we've been pretty consistent going back to the -- to last year talking about capacity utilization as a driver for profitability in this business. And we were in the low 80s in '22. And so with the balance of growing our business and rationalizing some of the footprint, we feel as though we've now optimized the network and continue to push toward those utilization levels that would be in line with the historical drivers for profitability for us. So I think that's the first thing.And then you talk about -- you asked about just where demand is or what the customer is doing or the industry dynamics. We don't mean to make any projections about what's going on in the industry and focus on what we can control. And I think that with these moves, we're going to get closer to our customers, which is a benefit with how we're moving things around. And I think we feel good about the choices on that front.I don't know if you got anything to add, Wes or Donnie?Donnie D. KingYes, Michael, I think just as a reminder, we talk about it often that we're a demand-backwards slaughter production organization. And so when you look at our customers' forward demand curve, plus some of the business we've picked up. We're literally gaining momentum on both sides, rightsizing capacity and growing at the same time.Wes MorrisYes. And maybe I could add one additional thing too that -- there's been a lot of conversation this morning about capital and what is that going to be going forward. We obviously talked about the assets that we're closing. I think that what you may not understand is how all those fit together. And so maybe I can help with that.A couple of years ago, we heavied up intentionally in capital to get ourselves in a position to have capacity, specifically more value-added branded-type capacity. And so that's where a lot of the extra spending above and beyond $1.5 billion.I think it's also important to link the plant closures that we talked about with the reduction in the capital that we're going to spend for the balance of '23 and probably what that looks like in '24. That work is done today, and these assets that we're shuttering would have required significant capital in order to make them competitive. And if you look at the returns on those, it really didn't make sense to do that.But I would tell you in terms of Chicken specifically and the capacity with -- even with the 10% reduction, we're just over 90% capacity, and we still have room to grow with the customers and as the market grows.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, in showing no additional questions, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.Donnie D. KingAll right. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for being with us today. As you've heard today, we're executing in the face of macro headwinds, and we're seeing early success demonstrated by the sequential improvement in Q3. I remain optimistic about our long-term outlook. Our customers and consumers are behind us. We're winning with both, while we remain focused on operational excellence. And we will continue to combat the current environment by focusing on what we can control, all in an effort to maximize value for shareholders.I'm very thankful for the hard work that our team members do every day to support these efforts. As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking soon.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

Amid spiraling feed and labor costs, meat companies have struggled to predict demand for their products.The notice to the state's Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development, dated Aug. 2, identified 35 hog farm operation sites. They included 13 sites in Newtown, Missouri; 12 in Lucerne, Missouri; and 10 in Princeton, Missouri.The layoffs are ""specific to our Missouri hog production (farm) operations,"" a Smithfield spokesperson said on Monday.The layoffs are slated for Oct. 8, according to the notice, which said all affected employees have been offered the opportunity to relocate to another company facility if a position is available that does not displace other employees.Smithfield is owned by Hong Kong's WH Group.Neither Smithfield nor the WARN data identified which specific facilities are impacted in Lucerne, Princeton and Newtown, Missouri. Smithfield has sow farms located in northern and northwest Missouri.News of the Smithfield layoffs came as Tyson Foods said on Monday it was shutting four more chicken plants in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri to cut costs, a blow to small communities in the U.S. heartland that depend on the meatpacker for nearly 3,000 jobs.Tyson also said that average prices for its pork fell by 16.4% in the quarter that ended on July 1, while pork sales volumes dropped 1.8%.

""The macro environment is challenging, and it'll continue to be challenging for a bit,"" King added.Tyson plans to shutter three chicken-processing locations in October of this year, including facilities located in North Little Rock, Ark.; Noel, Mo; and Dexter, Mo. The fourth location — in Corydon, Ind. — will close on or around March 1, 2024.The closures are part of an ""efficiency play short term,"" King said. He added the company is focused on ""profitable growth, particularly in the value-added space,"" such as chicken as well as its prepared foods division, which is a $10 billion business today.The company expects a total charge of $300 million to $400 million from these closures, which were announced after ""a lot of work and planning and preparation,"" according to King.""[The team members] will all be offered the opportunity to go to another place,"" he said.

Overall sales were down 3% for the quarter.But King is focused on the long-term outlook.""We are seeing a few more tailwinds in parts of our businesses,"" King said. ""In terms of what we're doing about all of this, our vision is delivering sustainable top-line growth and margin improvement over the long run. That's our plan. That's been our plan.""A bright spot this past quarter was prepared foods, as Americans flock to frozen Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-ups. King said it's the ""value-added convenience"" that entices consumers by ""providing affordable, accessible, and sustainable foods.""The company also updated its fiscal 2023 outlook. It now expects total sales between $53 billion and $54 billion for the full year, with sales growth flat year over year.""Overall, we expect shares to underperform peers today, with core results in Chicken continuing to underwhelm and updated FY23 guidance implying a further downwards bias to [fiscal fourth quarter estimates],"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note.Packages of Tyson-brand chicken products are displayed in the refrigerator section of an Associated Supermarket.

140,6f918eec-63b5-3145-a132-773d42c0ae9f,QCOM,2023-08-08,Tech earnings: What investors have learned so far,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-earnings-investors-learned-far-165327271.html,1691427207,VIDEO,"['AMAT', 'MRVL', 'QCOM', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'TSLA', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'CSCO', 'META', 'CRM', 'SNOW', 'NVDA', 'AVGO']","[So far, six of the ""magnificent seven"" tech companies have reported their quarterly results: Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA). Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon.Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.Video Transcript- Well, as the earnings season approached, many cast a wary eye on tech. The sector's been propping up the market. And given the unstable economic environment, investors have been using it to judge the health of the economy. And the majority of the so-called Magnificent Seven have all been able to beat Wall Street expectations. All have done well this earnings season.So let's bring in Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan to discuss more. Good to have you on the show, Daniel.DANIEL MORGAN: Hi, Rachelle.- So give us this breakdown of-- good to see you-- of how tech has been faring. Because obviously this initial rally started with tech. But where are we now when we factor in the earnings season?DANIEL MORGAN: What's interesting, Rachelle, as you mentioned in the beginning of the conversation, the bar for the tech sector coming into this second quarter was really low. But I will have to say that I was very pleased with the way that a lot of these earnings reports go. I mean, if we just kind of kick off and we look at online ad spend rates with Meta and Google a couple of weeks ago, the expectations were they would be flat to negative. And both those companies reported an increase in revenue. So Meta was up 11%, Google was up about 3.5% in their ad revenues.Story continuesAnd that kind of worked itself through the reports. Amazon kind of capped things off with a very good report with revenues up 11%. And then we had Apple, which was kind of a mixed review. We knew that smartphone unit volumes were going to be very muted going into the second quarter. But overall, their guidance that they gave for the upcoming third quarter was very strong in regards to services and iPhones.So I think overall, we'd have to take-- a takeaway from this, Rachelle, that is that numbers came in better than expected. We had a very low bar. Can we make up for these huge runs that we've had in these stocks, though? Right, Rachelle, coming into these reports. And I think that's where investors are pondering right now.- And of these Magnificent Seven, who was the most underwhelming for you? Especially when you factored in some of the guidance and the softness that we saw.DANIEL MORGAN: Microsoft was somewhat muted. Apple was somewhat muted. Those would be the two that kind of stood out at least at this point, to me, that were good numbers. They weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create like a catalyst or surprise, like we saw with Google, Meta, and let's say Amazon. So those two kind of stick in my mind.- And as we look at, of course, the chip space, NVIDIA riding high and enjoying those gains on that generative AI push that kept popping up in everybody's earnings call. But what about some of the other chipmakers? Who are you following there? And any surprises there?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, there's other stocks in that group, Rachelle, that could turn out to take some sort of not leadership role, but market share in the AI space. If you look at-- just to name a few, Marvel Technologies has their DSP chip called PAM, which is somewhat exciting. You have Broadcom, which has their Jericho3 chip. Now these are all chips that are just being rolled out that are in that same space that can compete directly against NVIDIA.We also know that Intel has their Falcon Shores chip that's going to come out next year. AMD, which reported last week, has their MI300, which is a AI chip that's being promoted as something that's going to compete directly against NVIDIA. So there are other companies in that space. We're going to be rolling into NVIDIA, Rachelle. About two weeks from now, we're going to get numbers from then mid week.But those are some of the reports that have kind of rolled in. Qualcomm has their AI 100 they reported last week also. So but that's still in an infancy stage. Rachelle, as we know, we haven't had a lot of tangible evidence that AI has actually directly impacted the financials of these companies. NVIDIA's really the only company that's actually shown tangible evidence of strength in terms of their AI chips.- And of course, a lot of these markets, these big tech names, also have a lot of exposure to China as well. And we're seeing some softness there in terms of demand. What are some of the stories that you're looking at coming out of China that you think we should be really keeping an eye on when it comes to big tech and where valuations then go from here?DANIEL MORGAN: You're right, Rachelle. I mean, Qualcomm gets about 60% of their revenues coming out of China. And China's head of the double sword, right? You have not only the impacts of them coming off of COVID lockdowns and how overall demand for, let's say, smartphones are coming. We know that when Apple reported numbers last week, their overall demand for smartphones in China was actually much stronger than people considered. It was actually positive where people thought it was negative.And then you also have this issue with regulators in terms of these back and forth of China no longer allowing certain chips that are produced by US companies to come into their country and vice versa. So China has got a lot of moving parts not only from the overall growth of their economy and demand for different electronics, but also in terms of what's going to happen from a regulatory perspective. How is that going to impact various companies?We already know there was news out a couple weeks ago about Micron. We know that NVIDIA-- those are companies that China has isolated as being not allowed to bring chips into their country, various chips that they make. So a lot of things coming out of China, a lot of things to follow.- And in terms of companies that you're going to be keeping an eye on as we continue through the thick of the earnings season, what are some of the bellwether stocks that are going to give us a better idea of how the consumer is feeling and how looking at things like business CapEx and what-- how companies are choosing to invest based on this macroeconomic environment?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, Rachelle, we have Cisco next week. So that's going to give us a good idea of what's going on in terms of CapEx, in terms of networking. The following week, we have Snowflake, we have NVIDIA. So those are some big numbers that are going to be coming out. Snowflake, as you know, is a middleware company and the data center space. They make the tools and software that allow you to pull data off of the big data centers.Obviously, NVIDIA, which we've already talked about in terms of AI. We also have Applied Materials reporting next week. They'll give us a good idea of how CapEx budgets are going in terms of companies spending on semiconductor equipment. And that gives us an idea of what the demand is in that space.So we still have a lot of big numbers coming out here. We also have Salesforce, which is a big play on the software as a service in terms of the enterprise. So we have more to go than just the so-called FAANG stocks or Magnificent Seven that have mostly reported up at this point. So we'll obviously be checking in here over the next couple of weeks on those numbers.- We appreciate you getting us up to speed on all of that and for joining us with your insights.DANIEL MORGAN: Thank you, Rachelle.- Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan. Good to see you.]"

(NYSE:KVUE) shares through an exchange offer. This move marks the next step in the separation from the parent company.The announcement comes just two months after the consumer health company was spun off of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The exchange offer allows Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders to exchange some or all of their shares for Kenvue stock at a 7% discount, subject to certain conditions.Benefits of the exchange offerWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with EXPE. Click here to check it out. JNJ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of JNJThe exchange offer provides shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth and potential of Kenvue as a standalone company. By exchanging their Johnson &amp; Johnson shares for Kenvue stock, shareholders can align their investment portfolios with their investment preferences and potentially benefit from the company's future success.J&amp;J's commitment to separationThis announcement follows Johnson &amp; Johnson's previous efforts to reduce its stake in Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE). The company had already received a waiver that dismissed the share lockup period associated with Kenvue's initial public offering in May. Now, with the exchange offer, the health care giant aims to further reduce its stake by at least 80%.Implications for investorsThe exchange offer signifies Johnson &amp; Johnson's commitment to the separation of Kenvue and its focus on its core business areas. By allowing shareholders to exchange their shares, the company is providing an avenue for investors to make a decision based on their individual investment strategies and preferences.Future prospectsOverall, the exchange offer presents an opportunity for Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders to participate in the future growth and success of Kenvue as an independent company. It will be interesting to see how many shareholders choose to take advantage of the exchange offer and what impact this will have on its ownership structure going forward.Story continuesAbout KenvueAlthough investors likely know Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kenvue probably needs an introduction. It is a consumer health company that operates globally. The company is divided into three segments: Self Care, Skin Health and Beauty and Essential Health.Under the Self Care segment, Kenvue offers a range of products, such as cough, cold and allergy remedies, pain relief, digestive health aids and smoking cessation products. The Skin Health and Beauty segment provides face and body care, hair care and sun protection products. The Essential Health segment offers oral and baby care, women's health and wound care products.Kenvue was a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson and has been in operation since 2022. The company is headquartered in Skillman, New Jersey and has a workforce of approximately 22,000 employees.Financial performance and outlookIn a recent earnings call, Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon and Chief Financial Officer Paul Ruh provided insights into the company's financial performance and discussed their outlook for the future. The call included forward-looking statements, emphasizing the company's operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth potential.During the call, Peter Grom, a UBS analyst, sought clarification on the company's gross margin performance. Grom noted that while the company faced headwinds from foreign exchange, standup costs and inflation, there were positive factors such as strong value realization and productivity gains. Grom requested further details on the decline in gross margin for the quarter and insights into the expected progression for the remainder of the year.Another analyst, Steve Powers, inquired about the growth performance of the company's Skin Health &amp; Beauty and Essential Health segments. Powers noted that the growth in both segments fell slightly below external forecasts and requested clarification on how they compared to the company's internal forecasts. Additionally, Powers sought information on when the company expected to fully cycle the portfolio rationalization headwinds impacting both segments. He also asked for insights into how the three segments would contribute to the company's organic growth target for the year.My takeJoe Wolk, the CFO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company has a voracious appetite for acquisitions and that the size of the deals do not matter as long as they are a good strategic fit and provide financial value. It is actively looking for opportunities in both medtech and pharmaceuticals.While Kenvue may not perfectly fit into these areas, there may be some question of its ability to provide financial value. It would seem that Johnson &amp; Johnson sees more potential for financial value elsewhere.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson What Is Johnson &amp; Johnson's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of July 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson had US$45.6b of debt, up from US$32.6b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$28.5b in cash, and so its net debt is US$17.1b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Johnson &amp; Johnson's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Johnson &amp; Johnson had liabilities of US$54.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$61.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$28.5b as well as receivables valued at US$16.8b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$70.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesGiven Johnson &amp; Johnson has a humongous market capitalization of US$439.3b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Johnson &amp; Johnson has net debt of just 0.50 times EBITDA, suggesting it could ramp leverage without breaking a sweat. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. Fortunately, Johnson &amp; Johnson grew its EBIT by 6.6% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Johnson &amp; Johnson's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Johnson &amp; Johnson produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 75% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewJohnson &amp; Johnson's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Johnson &amp; Johnson's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson   you should know about.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The industry is benefiting from heightened industrialization and urbanization, growing apprehensions about the environment, and the implementation of improved waste management methods. Per Statista, the global waste management sector was valued at $1.6 trillion in 2020 and is projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2030. Factors driving this growth include enhanced waste collection and rising volumes in emerging markets.Republic Services, Inc. RSG, Clean Harbors, Inc. CLH and Core &amp; Main, Inc. CNM are some stocks likely to gain from the abovementioned factors.Industry DescriptionZacks Waste Removal Services industry players have a crucial role in gathering, treating, and responsibly handling various types of waste to mitigate their impact on the environment and public health. In terms of the type of waste, the market is divided into Industrial, Commercial, Domestic and Agricultural waste segments. Industrialization has driven the prominence of the industrial waste category as it generates substantial demand for effective waste management solutions. In terms of service type, the market comprises Collection and Disposable services. Disposal services, driven by the increasing need for waste recycling to reduce environmental effects, is the leading revenue-generating segment.Factors Influencing the Future of the Waste Removal Services IndustryReviving Demand: The industry is mature, with demand for services remaining stable over time. Revenues, income and cash flows are anticipated to gradually reach the pre-pandemic healthy levels, aiding most industry players in paying out stable dividends.Sustained Business Opportunities: An increase in population, industrialization and urbanization should remain the key drivers of the industry as these result in a significant rise in garbage and recycling. Also, the use of advanced collection and recycling solutions is expected to pick up pace. Further, increasing global consciousness about environmental preservation has prompted governments and industries to adopt stringent waste management regulations. These promote responsible waste handling, disposal and recycling practices, thus enhancing business opportunities for waste management companies.Story continuesRising Costs a Headwind: Fluctuating commodity prices and changes in the global recycling landscape present a risk to the waste management sector. When recycling costs surpass market returns, waste management firms could encounter financial difficulties. Moreover, market disruptions like import restrictions by other nations on specific materials could affect recycling operations' profitability and sustainability.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, which is housed within the Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101.

For people living in its 240 remote villages and communities, obtaining lifesaving medicines can be a challenge. And extreme challenges call for innovative solutions.To help, we teamed up with the University of Alaska, a drone provider, local governments and others to demonstrate the use of drones to increase access to medicines in a proof-of-concept project. The drone was outfitted with thermal protection system packaging for the safe delivery of temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals.Drone technology expands access to medicines where it's needed mostFor our colleague and drone project adviser Leslie Brunette, this is the culmination of work that began more than a decade ago in her hometown of Fargo, North Dakota.""I was introduced to a young man from a tribal community, and his grandmother had invited me to go and visit him,"" said Brunette, who also serves as the global lead for Merck's Native American and Global Indigenous People employee business resource group. She explained that the young man suffered from a chronic illness, and the remote location of his community meant a trek of two to three hours to be able to access health care. A few years later, he became sick and had to be moved off of the reservation to receive care.""When he passed away, because of how much we learned about his family and his culture, I knew that more needed to be said and needed to be done. So I made that commitment to continue to try and be a voice that raised and elevated the awareness of indigenous communities across the United States and the world.""From dog sleds to drone deliveryIt's not the first time we've found an innovative way to deliver health care to families in Alaska.

157,bb694aef-44d5-3e4e-8966-2894005826ba,MRK,2023-08-08,Anixa Biosciences Announces Opening of Enrollment for Keytruda® Arm in Ongoing Breast Cancer Vaccine Clinical Trial,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anixa-biosciences-announces-opening-enrollment-123000425.html,1691411400,STORY,"['ANIX', 'MRK']","[SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (""Anixa"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ANIX), a biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer, today announced that its partner, Cleveland Clinic, has begun enrolling subjects in a treatment arm evaluating the combination of the Company's breast cancer vaccine with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab). An expansion of the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation trial of Anixa's breast cancer vaccine, this treatment arm aims to determine if the vaccine/Keytruda combination increases immune response.Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)Anixa's breast cancer vaccine is designed to generate T cells that target triple negative breast cancer (""TNBC""). Keytruda, a therapy marketed by Merck (NYSE: MRK), is approved for use with chemotherapy before surgery and then alone after surgery to treat both high-risk early-stage and advanced TNBC.Keytruda is a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor. T cells, a type of white blood cell involved in the body's immune system, have receptor proteins on their surface called checkpoints. These checkpoints are utilized by other immune cells to modulate the activity of T cells. Cancer cells, such as TNBC cells, have developed mechanisms to target checkpoints to inhibit the activity of T cells, as well as other immune cells. This inhibition enables the cancer cells to escape destruction by cytotoxic T cells. One of these key checkpoint receptors is known as PD-1 (Programmed Cell Death Protein-1). TNBC, like many other cancers, expresses a protein that binds to the PD-1 protein on T cells and essentially turns them ""off."" Keytruda is a monoclonal antibody, which blocks the ability of the cancer cells to inactivate T cells by shielding the PD-1 receptor.Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa stated, ""Cleveland Clinic has demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies that our breast cancer vaccine induces an immune response–including, we believe, production of T cells that can target TNBC–so we believe that the addition of Keytruda could have a synergistic effect. If a vaccine induces the creation of T cells targeting TNBC, and Keytruda generally maintains T cell activity, the combination could be very potent. We are grateful to the U.S. Department of Defense for providing the funding for this new arm of the trial and look forward to Cleveland Clinic's presentation of the updated data from this trial at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December.""Story continuesAbout Anixa's Breast Cancer Vaccine Clinical TrialThe Phase 1a study is designed to evaluate the safety of the vaccine, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), and monitor the immune response in vaccinated women. All participants in the Phase 1a study are women who have had triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) within the last three years and have been curatively treated having undergone standard of care. At the time of vaccination, these participants are tumor-free, as determined by standard diagnostic techniques, but are at high risk of recurrence.About Triple-Negative Breast CancerOne in eight women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer at some point in their lives. Approximately 10-15% of those diagnoses are TNBC, however TNBC accounts for a disproportionately higher percentage of breast cancer deaths and has a higher rate of recurrence. This form of breast cancer is twice as likely to occur in African-American women, and approximately 70% to 80% of the breast tumors that occur in women with mutations in the BRCA1 genes are triple-negative breast cancer.About Anixa Bioscience's Breast Cancer VaccineAnixa's breast cancer vaccine takes advantage of endogenously produced proteins that have a function at certain times in life, but then become ""retired"" and disappear from the body. One such protein is a breast-specific lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found post-lactation in normal, aging tissues, but is present in the majority of triple-negative breast cancers. Activating the immune system against this ""retired"" protein provides preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant that activates an innate immune response, which allows the immune system to mount a response against emerging tumors to prevent them from growing. This vaccine technology was invented by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy, who was the Mort and Iris November Distinguished Chair in Innovative Breast Cancer Research in the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute, and Cleveland Clinic exclusively licensed the technology to Anixa Biosciences. Dr. Tuohy was entitled to a portion of the commercialization revenues received by Cleveland Clinic and also held equity in Anixa. The technology is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial, conducted at Cleveland Clinic and funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to Cleveland Clinic.About Anixa Biosciences, Inc.Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer. Anixa's therapeutic portfolio consists of an ovarian cancer immunotherapy program that uses a novel type of CAR-T known as chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T) technology, and is being developed in collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center. The Company's vaccine portfolio includes a novel vaccine being developed in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic to prevent breast cancer – specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most lethal form of the disease – as well as a vaccine to prevent ovarian cancer. These vaccine technologies focus on immunizing against ""retired"" proteins that have been found to be expressed in certain forms of cancer. Anixa's unique business model of partnering with world-renowned research institutions on clinical development allows the Company to continually examine emerging technologies in complementary fields for further development and commercialization.

Here’s the latest...Halfway through the year, the aerospace recovery is still going strong. But Airbus is outpacing U.S. rival Boeing. Through June of this year, Airbus netted 1,044 new aircraft orders, roughly quadruple the 259 orders the European planemaker took in the first half of last year. By contrast, Boeing has scored only 415 new orders, versus 186 during the same period in 2022.Both companies will continue to see increases in new orders this year, though Boeing continues to slide into a distant second place in market share. So, their backlogs of unfilled orders keep expanding. Airbus: 7,967, versus 7,046 in June 2022. Boeing: 4,879, up from 4,239 at this point last year.The bigger question is how quickly the planemakers can increase deliveries to customers amid ongoing supply chain issues. Both Airbus (316 first-half deliveries, versus 295 in 2022) and Boeing (266 first-half deliveries, compared with 216 in 2022) have made some progress in this area and are opening new production facilities to speed up the process.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2023 Conference Call. With me today is Liam Griffin, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussions will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.Story continuesLiam K. GriffinThanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team continued to execute well during the third fiscal quarter despite macro headwinds, delivering in-line revenue, along with solid profitability and strong cash flow. Specifically, we delivered revenue of $1.071 billion, posted earnings per share of $1.73, and generated $306 million of operating cash flow.During the quarter, we continued to advance our technology road map and introduced new high-performance connectivity and analog solutions while supporting product launches at an expanding set of mobile and broad market customers. As a result, we expect double-digit sequential revenue and earnings growth in the September quarter.Turning to our quarterly business highlights. In mobile and IoT, we secured 5G content for Android smartphones across all tiers. We delivered Sky5 platforms for broadband CPEs of leading North American carriers. We supported WiFi 7 launches of tri-band routers for NETGEAR and TP-LINK and Powered Bell's WiFi 6E home gateway. In addition, we continue to gain design win momentum with our 5 gigahertz cognitive wireless audio solutions, supporting Samsung's Q-Symphony soundbars.Across infrastructure and industrial, we enabled 5G small cell deployments with a top North American operator and ramp timing solutions for AI data centers at a leading cloud provider.In automotive, we continue to post double-digit year-over-year revenue growth while capturing designs for telematics applications across a broad range of manufacturers. And we extended our engagements by leveraging our power isolation portfolio with a North American EV supplier. These highlights demonstrate Skyworks' technology leadership in mobile, while executing on a diversification strategy in high-growth end markets.Additionally, several disruptive market trends are now unleashing new meaningful growth opportunities for Skyworks. For example, generative AI is proliferating on a global scale with rapid adoption, sparking exponential growth in the amount of data accessed from the network edge to the cloud. In turn, this will further drive complexity in wireless infrastructure networks as AI will require higher throughput, more secure connections, lower latency and improved power management.Skyworks is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends with our advanced integrated solutions, supporting wireless infrastructure, cellular connectivity for mobile devices as well as other leading wireless protocols used in billions of IoT products.With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q4.Kris SennesaelThanks, Liam. Skyworks revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2023 was $1.071 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 59% of total revenue with broad content gains across our largest customer product portfolio, offset by ongoing weakness in demand from the Android ecosystem as these OEMs continue to reduce inventories.Growth markets were approximately 41% of total revenue. We have another strong contribution from the automotive, infrastructure and industrial markets. Gross profit was $509 million, resulting in a gross margin of 47.5%, in line with expectations. Gross margin was down 370 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by temporary factory underutilization as we rightsize our inventory levels.Operating expenses of $182 million declined 4% sequentially and year-over-year, given our ongoing focus on managing discretionary expenses. We generated $327 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 30.5%. We incurred $8 million of other expense and our effective tax rate was 13.2%, driving net income of $276 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.73, exceeding the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call.Now turning to cash flow. Skyworks' business model continues to deliver very strong cash generation. Third fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $306 million and capital expenditures were $31 million, resulting in free cash flow of $274 million. In fact, for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we've generated record free cash flow of $1.35 billion and record free cash flow margin of 38%. Also during fiscal Q3, we paid $99 million in dividends and repaid $500 million of our 2023 notes at maturity.Now let's move on to our outlook for Q4 of fiscal 2023. We expect to deliver double-digit sequential revenue and earnings per share growth in the September quarter. Specifically, we anticipate revenue between $1.190 billion and $1.240 billion. At the midpoint of $1.215 billion, revenue for the quarter is expected to increase 13% sequentially. This outlook considers the seasonal impact from major product launches, leveraging our technology leadership, deep customer engagements and world-class in-house manufacturing capabilities.Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 47% to 48%, reflecting the cyclical impact of lower factory utilization, while we are reducing our internal inventories. We expect operating expenses in the range of $178 million to $182 million, down 6.5% year-over-year at the midpoint as we continue to optimize operating efficiencies while making the necessary investments in technology and product development to further enhance our leadership position in mobile and drive diversification and growth in our broad markets business.Below the line, we anticipate roughly $8 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 160 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.215 billion, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $2.10, an increase of 21% sequentially.Lastly, given our conviction in Skyworks' long-term strategic outlook and consistent strong cash generation, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.68 per share.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.Liam K. GriffinThanks, Kris. Skyworks continues to deliver solid financial results despite a challenging macro environment. At the same time, we have further advanced our cutting-edge technologies and product road maps, targeting leading market segments that allow us to both expand and diversify our customer base.In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from powerful market trends, including the electrification and automation of vehicles, the expansion of the Internet of Things, the emergence of augmented and virtual reality and the rise of artificial intelligence, just to name a few.Looking ahead, we expect to capitalize on these opportunities and deliver growth in our highly profitable business with sustainable strong cash generation.Operator, let's open the lines for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler.Harsh V. KumarCongratulations, Liam, Kris and the Skyworks team. Solid results and very significant leverage in the September guide. My first question was regarding your largest customer who typically comes out with a new phone in the September time frame, Liam. Can you talk about your content at that new particular phone that might be coming out this time around?Liam K. GriffinSure, Harsh. Of course, I can't give you all the granularities here. But obviously, our engagement and our technical vectors here continue to be sharp. We expect to be among the leaders with our largest customer. We've got -- we have the know-how. We have the breadth of technology. We have the people and the manufacturing capabilities to execute. So we look forward to that, but we really can't give any further guidance, Harsh, as you know. But we certainly feel like our opportunities with our largest customer continue to be very quite large.Harsh V. KumarThat's fair enough. Liam, if I can ask about your gross margin, you're working through some inventory that's affecting your margins. But if I look -- let's just say I look forward, what would be some of the drivers that you have to improve your gross margins from where they are? Would they be more sort of industry dependent such as Android and sort of handset unit dependent? Or would there more be kind of Skyworks specific actions that would be bigger drivers of your gross margin?Kris SennesaelYes, Harsh, I'll take that question. So first of all, we delivered 4.5% in the June quarter, in line with expectations. And at the last earnings call, I indicated that gross margins were going to trend sideways for a couple of quarters. And so we just guided September 47% to 48%, which is pretty much in line with what I said during the last earnings call.The main issue why gross margins are temporarily a little bit lower compared to the historical levels, which was in the low 50s is mainly because of the macro headwinds and the softer demand environment, especially, as you indicated, in the Android ecosystem, while those customers are themselves reducing their internal inventory levels.And so as the business over a couple of quarters, will eventually get back and stronger, especially in Android as well as our broad markets business, we will see further improvements in our gross margins.In addition to this as well, Harsh, as you know, we are also reducing our own inventory levels on the balance sheet. This is probably something Skyworks specific that will take a couple of quarters. That is also contributing to the underutilization. But once we get to the more normalized levels of internal inventory, we will increase factory utilizations and ramp up the gross margins. I do expect the gross margins, again, over time, gradually improve to the low 50s. And then we will continue to work it towards our target model of 53%.Liam K. GriffinYes. And in addition to that, Harsh, as you may know, on the plus side, if you look at the cash generation that we're putting forth, very, very strong results. We're looking at 30% to 35% free cash flow, and that's sustainable. So you've got the margin hit, which is basically underutilization, but all of that has been paid for. And we have now the upside opportunity with free cash flow.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Chris Krastel from Wolfe Research.Chris KrastelI guess just to start, a general market question, when we've been going through an inventory correction here for a number of quarters. It looks like a bit of the fourth quarter of double-digit revenue declines on a year-on-year basis. So where do we stand now with that inventory correction at your customers? Are we getting to the point where those customers are getting a bit back to normal? And what does that imply for the next couple of quarters in terms of revenue outlook?Liam K. GriffinSure, Chris. Yes. I mean we do feel that the bottom is here for the most of the markets here that we address, and we should be seeing improving financials as we go forward. And if you look at our guide today, it looks pretty strong relative to the peers.But also the aperture that we have, not only with the larger players in mobile, which is certainly important, and we're very well positioned. But the broad markets business continues to grow. We're doing a lot of good work in automotive. We're doing a lot of good work in data center. A wide range of customers that are engaged with us that are also going through their cycle. But what we're seeing now is a bit of a turn up. We think it's sustainable. I think it's been a tough cycle in semis and tech in general. But our view is a little bit more optimistic now than it was last quarter for sure.Chris KrastelOkay. And just a follow-up on perhaps, China, specifically, and that's an area where we've heard some more cautious commentary from one of your peer -- from some of your peers. Do you think that demand from your China customers has also turned the corner? And what should we expect there? What are you seeing now? And what should we expect there?Liam K. GriffinYes. It's starting to turn up, Chris. It's not where we want it to be yet, but we've been very, very careful the way we're guiding and have put kind of pretty low vectors on top line. So I don't think that we're going to be surprised at all in any way. So you look at that portfolio, it's still bumpy. But on the flip side, you have other markets in Android that are doing quite well. Samsung has an opportunity to continue to grow. You've got a few other players out there that are important. Google is another customer that has a lot of great opportunity in mobile and other products that we work with. But it does -- like I said, it feels like what we're seeing and the dialogue we have with our end customers being more constructive.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen.Matthew D. RamsayYes. Maybe you could -- you guys report, obviously, the broad markets business and -- but there's a bunch of different end markets represented in there that I would imagine are seeing -- one thing I think the semiconductor cycle that you were speaking about has taught us is that different parts of the industry have different cycles that are not in amplitude or X, Y axes trying to be lined up with each other, and they're all over the place a bit.So maybe you could break down what you're seeing in the broad markets business. I would assume maybe stronger in automotive, weaker in some consumer areas. But if you could go through the different subsectors, that would be really, really helpful.Liam K. GriffinYes, sure. I'll give you as much as I can on that. So you mentioned automotive. That's a market that if you look back 2, 3 years ago at Skyworks, you'd see very, very little revenue at all. We're now we're well above the $200 million run rate. We expect that to accelerate substantially, a lot of great IP and technology that we brought forth with the Silicon Labs transaction. And also a lot of really organic work inside of Skyworks to drive more opportunities within these vehicles.So that's going to be an important part of the business. It already is. If we look at some of these other new markets, cloud, for example, we've got design wins in that area now. We're doing extremely well in an important category in WiFi 6 and WiFi 7. It's going to be a grower in the industry. I think it's going to be meaningful for the RF players with Skyworks being certainly at the top of the pack. And it's just a lot of general diversified products that we came in with the slab transaction that just very, very broadly -- which has a number of design wins across multiple categories that's also growing.So good stuff there. Plenty of room to go. I mean all these markets that we're dealing with have pretty, very significant TAM opportunities for us to grow into. So we're excited about that. We've made a lot of strategic additions in our sales force as well to try to penetrate more of these new markets and create that diversification vector. So we feel good about it. And we're just going to have to -- you're going to have to see it in the numbers, but we're certainly driving to those outcomes and expect we can do it.Matthew D. RamsayJust as my follow-up, Kris, maybe you could talk a little bit about your view into OpEx in the next few quarters. I think it was a hair below where we had modeled it anyway. And with some of the gross margin pressure given the utilization, maybe that makes sense. But there's a lot of opportunities ahead for you guys as well, particularly in the broad market to invest in. So if you could just kind of level set us on the next few quarters on the OpEx line, that would be helpful.Kris SennesaelYes. Thanks for that question. And so we can't control the macro, right, and we can't control some of the softness in some of the end markets that everybody industry is going through, but we can control, of course, our own operating expenses and the investments that we make in the business. And there, again, we're not hesitating.We are going to continue to invest and play to win. But at the same time, we're going to continue. And Skyworks is pretty good at that, continue to focus on efficiencies and really spending the dollars where we get the biggest bang for the buck. And as you saw from the prepared remarks, we have been able to trim down a little bit the OpEx, again, without cutting into our key technology development and product road maps, just focusing on effectiveness and efficient processes.Some of that was also we reduced a little bit of the variable compensation because of the top environment that we play in. That will kick back a little bit as we start the new fiscal year in the December quarter. But overall, I feel good about the level of spending that we do in support of our growth.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research.Edward Francis SnyderA couple of questions, if I could, please. First, there was a lot of talk earlier this year that Skyworks is going to lose some share in WiFi and the high-end handsets, not the CPE units or the stuff that goes into homes with handsets. And I guess there's some basis for that given how much content you have. I think you have and have had all the remote PAs for both 5-years and 2.5 as well as some LNAs in some flagship phones.Maybe you could provide a little color on that. Should we expect your share to moderate a little bit in the second half of this year? Do you feel like you're not giving up anything there given kind of your dominance of that space over the last several years, actually?Liam K. GriffinYes. Ed, that has been a stalwart within the business and the WiFi cycle very strong. We have great position, 6 and going into WiFi 7. I mean, you know these technologies, they're not easy, and there's a big leap between those 2 cycles, but we're in great shape. There's certainly a tremendous amount of consumer activity that hasn't been consummated. WiFi is a really important technology. I think everybody knows that. And it's used in so many different applications that we try to really deliver the best solutions. And that's been very powerful for us and our customers like the technology. And I think we've got a great opportunity over the next several years.Edward Francis SnyderOkay. And if I could, the transmit DRx module, which is quickly -- it already has become one of the most lucrative modules and some of the high-end phones out there. You guys kind of own that space, but it's been really clear in the last year or so, that the competition for that spot has increased dramatically. I think even Avago is now trying to get into that. I know Qorvo tried to fill a piece. Qualcomm's always talked about, et cetera. Incumbency has a lot of inertia with it. We've seen that year after year after year in iPhone.Is that still the case of this? Because the flip side of this, we haven't seen incumbency really help anybody in the ultra-high band. That shares bounced back and forth. You had some of it last year, Qorvo and Avago split it. This year, Qorvo is getting a little bit. So I'm just trying to get a feel for is incumbency worth more in the transmit diversity section, do you think, and think you'll continue to dominate that spot?Liam K. GriffinYes, I would look at it at a high level, not necessarily any one specific customer, but performance wins and flexibility wins and supply chain wins and having incredible people on our team that can work shoulder to shoulder in the lab to create amazing outcomes. And I think that really is what differentiates us. And it's not just talk. I mean these are real actions, the people in our fabs, our factories we're using our own technologies, as you know, whether it's BAW or TC-SAW.All those recipes are really homegrown. I think it makes it unique for us. Our customers love it because they have a voice in the product. And if there's any fine-tuning or tweaking, technically, we could do it. So we love that.And some of those products that you mentioned, you know probably more than anybody. These are really, really hard products, really difficult with demanding customers. But if you're able to handle that and hit that fast ball, it's great for the customer, and it's great for the supplier like us. So we're looking forward to more of that. We love challenges, and we're ready to do more.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.Blake Edward FriedmanThis is Blake Friedman on for Vivek. I might have missed it in the prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could provide what percent of revenue came from your largest customer. And in addition to that, if you're able to quantify the percentage of your broad market sales that come from this largest customer, that would be helpful.Kris SennesaelYes. So the largest customer in the June quarter was approximately 64% of total revenue when -- if you do the math correctly, you will see that's kind of flattish, slightly up, maybe 1% on a year-over-year basis, which clearly illustrates that we continue to win big with that large customer.And as you indicate, yes, we went with that customer, not just at the phone, but in every product that they have and every product that they brought to the market and that they will bring to the market in the future. And so you will find not only Skyworks content in the iPhone, but you will also find it in the iPad and in the iMac and in the HomePod and in other products that it will bring to the market. And that's roughly on or about 15% of that revenue with the customer.Blake Edward FriedmanGot it. Helpful. And then just maybe a longer-term question thinking about the recovery of certain aspects of the business. I know you derisked your China Android exposure early into the cycle, I believe they only account for 5% of sales or so. So as the market normalizes, I'm just trying to get a perspective on how we should think about your long-term China and broad disclosure in terms of total revenue?Kris SennesaelYes. So currently, it's very low, right? As you point out, yes, China is less than 5% of our revenue. Samsung is less than 5% of our revenue. We still have Google, but also currently less than 5% of our revenue. As we all know, there is inventory overhang at most of those customers, they -- especially inventory overhang at the phone level that needs to be clear, it's improving. We see higher demand, higher bookings from those customers, but it's improving slowly.Eventually -- and it's hard to predict the timing, but towards the start of 2024 that will be done and then there will be tremendous upside for us because we continue to win designs with those customers. And again, as that business will start ramping again, we are well positioned.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna.Christopher Adam Jackson RollandThanks for the question. I would love to get into inventory and DOIs and how play into your gross margins and underutilization. You kind of hit on this, but would love a little bit more detail in terms of your outlook longer term. So ultimately, where do you guys want your DOIs to go? When do you think you can get there? And I believe the assumption should be gross margins would kind of hang around here for a while until you reach that level? Is that the correct assumption?Kris SennesaelYes. So first, on inventory, we have now 2 consecutive quarters where inventory came down slightly in absolute dollars despite the fact that this was our 2 slowest seasonal quarters. Looking forward to September and December with much stronger revenue and strong sequential revenue growth into September and further into December, we will continue to substantially bring down inventory in absolute doors and of course, on higher revenue as well in terms of days of inventory.The target is to try to get inventory on or about $1 billion or slightly below that. And -- but to your point, it will take a couple of quarters for us to be able to do that. And so the gross margin will trend sideways for a couple of quarters until we get through this inventory reduction on our side. And until, of course, the overall business starts picking up again, as we discussed with Android, the large customer, stronger tailwinds in the broad markets business and then the gross margin will start picking up again.Christopher Adam Jackson RollandAnd perhaps one for Liam. You guys haven't emphasized at least on your call, your opportunity in BAW in some time. How are you guys feeling about that? I think you guys have done well, putting it into diversity receive, but would you expect some stand-alone BAW opportunities to kind of move the needle this year?Liam K. GriffinYes, absolutely. We have certainly the most significant customers in very good shape and a lot of great development, shoulder-to-shoulder work, and that's been going well. But there's also BAW deployments in other markets that we can dive into, even in some of these things, access points and routers and infrastructure products. Think of BAW as a technology, not a product. So it's a very difficult technology and only a few companies know how to do it and also the manufacturing scale and the technology there as well is very unique, and there's just a few companies that can do it.But the aperture around bulk acoustic wave filtering is really strategic. It's hard to do, and it doesn't have to be handset only, as you mentioned. And we do have a number of examples even in WiFi and some other markets and infrastructure. So it's a key technology. Not a lot of companies do it. There's certainly folks on this call that are listening to peers that do it, but it's not an easy job.But I think our teams have worked really well. And the aperture that we have is quite wide. We continue to bring on more accounts. We also do a really good job of adopting -- of getting our customers to adopt the higher levels of performance that you get in bulk acoustic wave. So some of that is demonstrated in products and usually in the more difficult and challenging operating conditions, BAW really makes sense, and we're quite good at executing there.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreI wonder if you could address any long-term ramifications from Huawei potentially coming back with its own 5G solution? Does that create long-term opportunity for you? Does that create risk to your existing Chinese customers? Just anything that we should think about how that affects Skyworks.Liam K. GriffinYes. It appears that Huawei is really off the shelf right now. So it's not even in the forecast. Having said that, there's still opportunity for the China market to grow. Kris mentioned it a little bit. We talked about the opportunity for Android to turn back up and you get the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi players. So there's a lot of opportunity there. But Huawei itself as it is at this stage, it's really a nonstarter, could change. But in today's environment, it's really not a customer that we're working with.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James.Srinivas Reddy PajjuriKris, you alluded to the December quarter growing as well. So given that we're coming off of a cyclical trough in Android, should we expect December to be somewhat about seasonal? If you can talk about directionally how you're thinking about December, that will be helpful.Kris SennesaelYes. As you know, we only guide 1 quarter at a time, and so I'm going to stick to that. But directionally, yes, we do expect December to be up sequentially following a normal seasonal sequential growth patterns that we've experienced in the past.Srinivas Reddy PajjuriOkay. Got it. And then maybe for Liam. Liam, there has been some news about China banning gallium and the germanium exports. Just wondering, given a lot of your products you use those materials, just wondering if there's any impact that you see in the short term on that.Liam K. GriffinYes. We saw the note there. And I will tell you, there's really no risk for us right now. We understand those materials. We've been using them for a while. And our teams have looked deeply at this and looked at the opportunity, and we should be fine. I wouldn't worry about it. We've assessed that there's very little risk to the business, we're experts in these solutions and the materials behind it. So it's not -- in our view, it is that something to worry about.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.Karl AckermanI know the seasonality is a bit thrown out the window in the current down cycle. But I was hoping you might be able to comment, Kris, on the outlook between mobile and broad markets in September, particularly broad markets, broad markets is usually up, but I think we're going through a little bit of excess inventory. So if you could just highlight perhaps your outlook between mobile and broad markets for September, that would be quite helpful.Kris SennesaelYes. So obviously, September is a very strong mobile quarter, especially with the content that we have at our large customer and a big ramp that we have supported over the last 10 or 12 years. And so most of the sequential growth in the September quarter is coming from our mobile segment. Broad markets might be flat to slightly down a couple percent on a sequential basis for the reasons that you just mentioned, right, there is a little bit of inventory overhang in some of those end markets, very similar to what our peers and competitors have indicated over the last 2 weeks at their earnings calls. We are obviously not immune to that.Although, again, I think our markets business, we are -- as Liam indicated earlier, we are well positioned. There's a couple of spots, including automotive, right, that continues to grow double digit year-over-year. But overall, there's a little bit of inventory overhang that needs to be flushed out in the next couple of quarters. And then broad markets will start growing faster as well.Karl AckermanGot it. I guess maybe just to follow up on that, if I may. If you could just speak broadly to how your inventory looks outside of the handset business. Again, it sounds like we have some inventory depletion that is still needed to reoccur. But the flip side of that argument then is how do you refill the channel once the channel is depleted, perhaps that exits -- perhaps it's more clean channel exiting the year. Just any thoughts into 2024 at a higher level in terms of how you look at broad markets once this inventory overhang abates?Kris SennesaelYes. And maybe first, a clarification, right. A lot of the inventory overhang for -- as it relates to Skyworks is not in the distribution channel at the component level. We typically manage that proactively and try to keep inventory at the component level, at a healthy level. The issue is more that certain customers put components into products and then the products didn't fully sell through to the end customers at the level they were expecting. And so that needs to burn off.As I said, like it's probably going to take a couple of quarters. But to your point, yes, once that is done, business will come back and we'll probably come back stronger as we will transition from under shipping to potentially shipping in line with end customer demand, and that will, by itself, fuel the growth.OperatorAnd your last question comes from the line of Ruben Roy from Stifel, Nicolaus.Ruben RoyLiam, when you went through the segments or the various units in the broad markets piece, you didn't talk about communications infrastructure. And I think that historically, if you look at core Skyworks and then you add on top some of the timing stuff that you got from the I&amp;A acquisition, that was probably a decent chunk of the business. And so I was wondering if I'm right about that. And then secondly, if you can give us an update on what you're seeing. It sounds like that's a pretty tough market right now and not a lot of visibility rest of this year and maybe even into next year. So would love to kind of understand how you're thinking about that business.Liam K. GriffinYes. No, great question. Actually, I should have given that answer already. But no, we actually have meaningful numbers in the infrastructure side. And actually, in the last quarter, we actually had a record in the infrastructure side. So with all of the other chop that we see in handsets and some of the consumer products, the infrastructure business is actually quite strong. There's a lot of room for us to grow into that portfolio. We have very good relationships, and the infrastructure industry tends to be a little bit cyclical, and we're starting to see more opportunity there.Now some of that is just moving further up in 5G and other markets and even some of the upgrades that we see in WiFi and technologies like that. So they're all important to us, but infrastructure is still very solid, and we expect that to be a driver in '24.Ruben RoyOkay. Okay. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up, Liam, kind of another high-level question around sort of the macro and how you weigh that against design activity. It sounds like things are going well in some of these new areas that you're addressing auto. Obviously, WiFi has a cycle coming up. But I mean, generally, outside of mobile, if you look at broad markets, how would you assess design activity sort of as you look into the second half of the year versus maybe this time last year?Liam K. GriffinYes. I tell you, it's really getting better. The design win activity is better, the customer engagements and discussions that we're having are getting better and more forward-looking. The portfolio is broader than it ever has been. We've got a lot more talent in the organization. Operationally, we've gone through some cyclical hits here with depreciation that we talked about with CapEx, but that's turning into a cash flow play right now that's going to really drive the business and allow us to put forth more powerful investments.So we feel good about it. And I think the pieces can really drive a great 2024. We're getting through these quarters right now, the business is starting to improve, and we expect to have double-digit performance as we go forward.OperatorThank you. Mr. Griffin, there are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.Liam K. GriffinWell, thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to talking to you at upcoming investor conferences. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you all for participating.

The Dow climbed back +408 points on the day, +1.16%, while the Nasdaq gained +84 points, +0.61%, and the S&amp;P 500 +40, +0.90%. The small-cap Russell finished up +0.08%.U.S. intel software firm Palantir Technologies PLTR are seeing shares fall -5% in the after market, following a meet on its Q2 bottom line to earnings of $0.05 per share (well ahead of the -$0.01 reported in the year-ago quarter) for its third straight earnings beat and positive earnings trend. Revenues of $533 million were also precisely in-line with expectations. The company is still up +164% year-to-date, but this latest slide adds to the stock’s downside over the past week.Palantir stands in an intriguing niche of the software industry, especially within the A.I. segment, and the company took a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) into this afternoon’s report. However, at current market valuations, just meeting estimates is begging for something of a drawdown. Its U.S. business gained +20% year over year, and International was +30%. The company also declared a $1 billion share buyback program. At an 85 P/E, it’s still not cheap, but a further pullback will bring some eyeballs.Skyworks Solutions SWKS outpaced estimates on its bottom line for fiscal Q3 this afternoon — earnings of $1.73 per share beat by 6 cents — while quarterly sales were also neatly aligned with estimates, at $1.07 billion. Guidance for Q4 was in-line, though the company did announce a +10% dividend increase. Shares nearly a week ago came decidedly down from their near-term highs, but are inching down another -1.5% in late trading.Paramount Global PARA class-B shares are up +4% on the news of its Q2 results after today’s closing bell on a big earnings beat: $0.10 cents per share versus -$0.01 expected, and revenues for the quarter stormed ahead of the Zacks consensus, as well: $7.62 billion versus $7.43 billion anticipated. Paramount+ subscriber levels came down again, though not nearly as severely as a quarter ago, which led to a big selloff the company has not yet begun to re-scale. That said, its sale of Simon &amp; Schuster publishing to KKR for $1.6 billion will likely give the company more financial flexibility.The big winner this afternoon is education platform provider Chegg CHGG, which zoomed up +27% on its in-line Q2 earnings of 28 cents per share and top-line beat of $182.9 million versus the expected $176.2 million. Next quarter sales guidance remains in range of existing consensus, and subscription revenue dropped -5% in the quarter. So why the big up-bid? Chegg shares had been more than -60% year to date. The company trades well off its more than $110 per share highs back in early 2021. It’s also the ninth-straight positive surprise quarter.Tomorrow’s festival of earnings continues when we hear from UPS UPS, Eli Lilly LLY, Take-Two Interactive TTWO and Under Armour UAA, among many others. We’ll also hear from a couple Fed presidents (Philadelphia’s Harker and Richmond’s Barkin) and see a new trade balance ands wholesale inventories, both for June.

As set forth in the ""Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table found above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods, compare our operating performance against peer companies, and determine payments under certain compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-recurring expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make forecasts.We provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We also believe that providing non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows investors to assess the extent to which our ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. We further believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share allows investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain income tax items which may not occur in each period presented and which may represent non-cash items unrelated to our ongoing operations. We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures.We calculate non-GAAP gross profit by excluding from GAAP gross profit, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We calculate non-GAAP operating income by excluding from GAAP operating income, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and restructuring-related charges. We calculate non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share by excluding from GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain income tax items. We exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below:Share-Based Compensation Expense - because (1) the total amount of expense is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred, (2) it is an expense based upon a valuation methodology premised on assumptions that vary over time, and (3) the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of the control of such companies.Acquisition-Related Expenses and Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles - including such items as, when applicable, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Settlements, Gains, Losses, and Impairments - because such settlements, gains, losses, and impairments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are infrequent in nature, (3) are generally not directly controlled by management, (4) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized, and/or (5) can vary significantly in amount between companies and make comparisons less reliable.Restructuring and Other Charges - because these charges have no direct correlation to our future business operations and including such charges or reversals does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Certain Income Tax Items - including certain deferred tax charges and benefits that do not result in a current tax payment or tax refund and other adjustments, including but not limited to, items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.Our earnings release contains forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of our 2023 fiscal year (""Q4 2023""). We provide this non-GAAP measure to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide it to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking estimate of Q4 2023 GAAP diluted earnings per share to a forward-looking estimate of Q4 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 2023 (other than estimated share-based compensation expense of $0.20 to $0.30 per diluted share, estimated amortization of intangibles of $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share and certain tax items of -$0.10 to -$0.20 per diluted share) is difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. The probable significance of these unknown items, in the aggregate, is estimated to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.15 in quarterly earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.[a] The following table summarizes the expense recognized in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation, Stock Compensation (in millions):Three Months EndedNine Months EndedJune 30, 2023July 1, 2022June 30, 2023July 1, 2022Cost of goods sold$3.3$8.0$13.4$22.9Research and development24.424.269.774.4Selling, general, and administrative17.119.952.160.9Total share-based compensation$44.8$52.1$135.2$158.2SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAs of(in millions)June 30, 2023September 30, 2022AssetsCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$739.5$586.8Accounts receivable, net726.81,094.0Inventory1,235.61,212.1Property, plant, and equipment, net1,424.41,604.8Goodwill and intangible assets, net3,446.33,621.4Other assets891.5754.7Total assets$8,464.1$8,873.8Liabilities and EquityAccounts payable$160.1$274.2Accrued and other liabilities934.5941.5Debt1,491.62,189.1Stockholders’ equity5,877.95,469.0Total liabilities and equity$8,464.1$8,873.8SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWSThree Months EndedNine Months Ended(in millions)June 30, 2023July 1, 2022June 30, 2023July 1, 2022Cash flow from operating activitiesNet income$195.8$267.3$738.0$973.0Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Share-based compensation44.852.1135.2158.2Depreciation97.497.0295.8289.6Amortization of intangible assets, including inventory step-up51.365.9174.7219.1Deferred income taxes(29.2)23.9(86.3)30.3Asset impairment charges——17.0—Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs0.91.02.93.0Other, net(4.2)(6.5)(2.2)(5.1)Changes in assets and liabilities:Receivables, net(41.9)12.5367.2(29.4)Inventory24.5(176.5)(24.9)(227.8)Accounts payable(3.6)17.5(98.3)32.5Other current and long-term assets and liabilities(30.1)(140.3)(28.2)(255.1)Net cash provided by operating activities305.7213.91,490.91,188.3Cash flow from investing activitiesCapital expenditures(31.3)(125.1)(140.2)(347.7)Purchased intangibles(3.7)(2.3)(18.8)(16.3)Purchases of marketable securities(11.7)(12.9)(282.1)(91.4)Sales and maturities of marketable securities223.8115.5289.0216.2Other5.87.65.97.6Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities182.9(17.2)(146.2)(231.6)Cash flow from financing activitiesRepurchase of common stock — payroll tax withholdings on equity awards(1.0)(1.6)(33.6)(85.2)Repurchase of common stock — stock repurchase program—(119.1)(175.3)(806.5)Dividends paid(98.7)(90.0)(296.7)(273.7)Net proceeds from exercise of stock options0.10.61.03.2Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan——15.515.6Payments of debt(500.0)—(700.0)(50.0)Net cash used in financing activities(599.6)(210.1)(1,189.1)(1,196.6)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents(111.0)(13.4)155.6(239.9)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period832.6656.4566.0882.9Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$721.6$643.0$721.6$643.0View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230807626443/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Constance Griffiths(949) 231-4207Investor Relations: Kris Sennesael(949) 231-4247]"

Good afternoon, everyone, and we hope you're well. Even with the volatility in the economic environment and some revenue variance in a few of our product lines, we are enjoying 2023 year-to-date more than last year. ICU Medical is operationally serving customers well and finding the proper balance of time between commercial focus and internal self-help, which has become most acutely about supply chain efficiency.The macro environment was broadly fine for Q2 with consistency in freight and fuel pricing and some increasing pressure from currencies in our production geographies. International demand was consistent throughout the quarter, and the U.S. was a little choppy for us with lower acuity census and admissions in April, but improved through the rest of the quarter. Like everyone in our industry, we want to start first by thanking our customers and their frontline workers for trusting us to serve you during these times.We'll use the time today to discuss the Q2 revenue performance of our business units, provide more color below the business unit level due to certain of the results, update on the normal housekeeping items including our quality remediation, the separation from Smiths Group Systems and our next steps towards integration and synergy capture, explain our profitability and margins halfway through the year, and outline the actions we need to take near term to ensure we optimize for the medium and long term, reiterate and check our progress against the key short-term priorities we outlined at the start of the year, and take stock of where we are 18 months into the acquisition and the broader environment. And again, we'll skip any comments on longer-term value creation, but did want to make a clearer view of what we want to be. We finished the quarter with $535 million in adjusted revenues. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $98 million and adjusted EPS was $1.88. Revenue growth was down 1% on a constant currency basis, minus 2 and a minus 2 on a reported basis, and we had improved gross margins versus Q1.We finally had a slower quarter of inventory investment into the business and believe we have peaked on that and have adjusted output to bring inventory more in line with historical levels as we are sustaining appropriate service. And the supply chain is more stable, and we have a better sense of the actual underlying revenues.Relative to Q1, the operational impact of currency is becoming more of a headwind as both the Mexican and Costa Rican local currency strengthened meaningfully against the dollar. On the last call, we said we feel better about revenue growth for each product line where we've been historically stable, meaning legacy ICU and revenue recapture where we're now stable, meaning legacy -- the legacy SM portfolio. The majority of the acquired product lines are growing year-over-year, but we specifically have delays in bringing back the Vascular Access revenues to the level we wanted. The Legacy ICU portfolio of pumps and consumables has grown fine, but in Q2, we had some shortfalls in IV Solutions with a weak April combined with some of the lingering issues we had on the one product resource from Pfizer. The Vascular Access recapture, which is ballpark about $20 million to $25 million less in revenues for the year, does impact profitability and the IV Solutions less so.So let me start with our Consumables business unit, which is our largest and most profitable unit. We had $237 million in revenue which was down 1% on a constant currency basis and down 2% reported. Obviously, we need to explain a bit more here. The legacy ICU IV therapy product lines, which is the largest component of the business unit had a record quarter again in Q2 with the business being the largest it's ever been. The growth was driven by new customer implementations, good census in May and June and increased capacity and ability to serve the market with a focus on clinical differentiation and the creation of niche markets. But like Q1, that growth was offset by the Vascular Access portion of the business unit. On the last call, we said we were at the bottom here as losses occurred throughout last year and that felt very similar to the IV consumables and pump losses when we purchased Hospira when customer losses were still felt in the 4 to 6 quarters post deal. We did not backtrack at all in Q2 versus Q1, but the new business adds did not bring any meaningful net improvement, so revenues were flat.Relative to our own expectations, as I just mentioned, our best estimate is that we'll be about $20 million to $25 million short here for the year relative to our plan. And to be clear, our confidence in right to win here has not changed, but it's just taking time. The losses from 2021 and 2022 were primarily due to supply chain issues and those core issues have been addressed by our team. To be even more transparent, our medium- and longer-term expectation was only to get back the minority of what was lost over the last 2 years. The other components of the business unit are oncology and tracheostomy, both of which are okay over the balance of the year and aided from increased capacities. On the last call, we said in the near term, we believe all 4 underlying lines are improving commercially and operationally with the losses predominantly out and improved capacities, and we saw that on the revenues over the first half of the year on 3 of the lines and believe we will see sequential improvement each line for the balance of the year. But the Vascular Access delays do make it to jump over the back half comps of last year, which included some of the Q3 operational catch-up and had meaningful COVID-related syringe sales. So the overall business unit growth rate will be impacted, and we're going to have to keep talking about the individual lines until it's rectified.Moving to Infusion Systems, which is the combination of the Legacy ICU LVP pump business and the syringe and ambulatory pump businesses. This business reported $153 million in revenues, which equated to 5% growth constant currency or 3% reported. Q2 of '22 started to get more normal last year after the miserable start of Q1 '22. The ambulatory and syringe product lines continue to be moving towards historical levels. Similar to last quarter, we saw good hardware improvement for both ambulatory and syringe pump hardware, which was offset by decreases on a year-over-year basis on ambulatory disposables as in the latter part of Q2 last year and throughout Q3 2022, we shipped so many ambulatory disposables to catch up on back orders as we improved production mid-Q2 last year. It will make Q3 a tougher comp, but regardless of that, we feel fine with our previous commentary on the business unit for the year. On LVPs, we've talked about how it was bumpier for decision-making over the last 2 years. We hope the recent market events allow customers to move forward with evaluations and akin to some of the large non-infusion capital vendors. We don't see capital availability as a massive impediment to our types of products. We're starting to see some commercial benefits of having a full infusion device portfolio with our combined portfolio position differently versus other participants. Again, we believe over the medium term relative to our size, our competitive opportunity is solid, and we're focused on commercial execution here in a more action-oriented market.Finishing the business unit discussion with Vital Care, which had $145 million in revenues or a decline of 7% on a constant currency basis. The entire decline in the business unit was due to IV Solutions on a year-over-year basis. Really, 3 primary drivers here. First, just an unusually like April, which did not get made up for over the balance of the quarter. Second, as we mentioned in the last 2 quarterly calls, we've been a little short from Pfizer on the last remaining category from Rocky Mount, which has been hurting us for a few million a quarter; and lastly, a little light on some specialty SKUs. At least for June and July, orders look closer to normal, but the Pfizer shortage will continue to drag on given the Rocky Mount news. All of this impacts profitably slightly as IV Solutions currently deflates the corporate gross margin by ballpark 500 basis points. The rest of the business unit was generally flat as expected with temperature management up a little. The short story message has not changed for us. Our differentiated Legacy ICU businesses are doing well and we're focused on regaining a portion of the lost revenues in the acquired categories that are outlined in our investor presentations. Of the 5 product families we highlighted in that slide, ambulatory pumps, syringe pumps, Vascular Access, tracheostomy and temperature management all except Vascular Access are improving year-over-year and all are still below historical pre-COVID levels. We need to get all 5 improving consistently.We stated on the last call how we were impacting the self-inflicted challenges on many of the businesses. And we believe in Q2, we would have all 3 business units growing year-over-year and hit the bottom of the acquired products that were going backwards. We came up a few million short on revenue in Vascular Access to deliver that for consumables, and we add more variants in IV Solutions than anticipated. However, we've become more reliable for customers with very minor exceptions and are able to engage in rebuilding trust and service as the products have always been well liked and any improvement in underlying demand and improving census work in our favor. But improving that service level to the customer, which was exacerbated in the broader environment last year, has increased our inventory levels to more than what's required to run the business day to day, similar to some other health care categories or even other industries. As we mentioned on the last call, we need to focus here to get back to the cash generation we want. That brings some short-term headwinds, but it's the right thing to do from a value perspective. Very specifically, we have been building inventory, both raw materials and finished goods since the beginning of 2022. The rate of build finally slowed in Q2 with the more recent months showing improvements. Brian will go through the specifics, but we have tried to do this in the right way without disrupting the supply chain and without significant capital to restructuring here. Okay. Let me get through the housekeeping items, and I'll bring it back to results and our priorities. On quality, as we've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, we're completely engaged and our teams are working hard to resolve the FDA warning letter in our acquired company and related inspectional observations. Our efforts to complete related quality system improvements and associated remediations are on track. We've made heavy investments into remediation and believe the majority of remediation work be done over the next few months and spend will ramp down. Same speech on the warning letter, the existence of a warning letter while I'm desirable is the regulatory agency trying to move the ball forward, and we've talked about how these regulations give us the right to participate. Regardless of where it appears in the P&amp;L, we're spending heavily, so making progress here is extremely important.In Q2, we did transition away from Smiths Group's IT systems and are fully separated from all TSAs with better stability. We're now focused on the eventual ERP integration, standing on our own is the first step towards real integration next year to capture the next wave of synergies in manufacturing, supply chain and functional support over time. It's also important to the extent we want to be able to make any decisions on the underlying portfolio.Over the first 6 months of the year, we've taken the first steps towards certain manufacturing consolidations, and real estate adjustments and there's likely more to come, all of which will be additive to gross margins medium and longer term, but they take some time to get implemented. Moving the ERP integration forward is important because it allows us to optimize some duplication in our physical logistics and service networks. In terms of the balance of the year and being 50% of the way to the midpoint of our EBITDA range, given what we need to do to improve inventory efficiency and having less Vascular Access sales than we'd like, we didn't want investors to think we had the flexibility realistically towards -- to be towards the higher end of our previous guidance range. While gross margins have been improving year-to-date, they will be impacted as we slow down the factories below current demand levels. So we're tightening it up a bit. We need to run a smoother operation even if customer service levels are high, we can't run an inefficient production environment, and Brian will go through the details.18 months into the acquisition and the broader economic environment, we've worked -- we have resolved production, logistics, operational -- delivered operational stability, have growth in most of the businesses and are working hard to ensure a clean bill of health and quality.Our priorities for 2023 remain unchanged, delivered revenue growth as expected in our differentiated business units while progressing the key product platforms, progress our quality remediation and ensure quality for patients and high compliance for regulatory authorities, respectively, focus on cash flow again by improving working capital and addressing the available items on the P&amp;L, whether above or below the line. Lay the groundwork via separation and then integration for capture of the remaining synergies and rationalize the portfolio, which becomes easier after it's separation and being stable.Just to be extremely clear on the medium-term state we're looking for. We want our Consumables and Systems businesses to be reliable growers with an industry acceptable profit margin with the tightest and most optimized manufacturing network and each with a multiyear innovation portfolio. Over the last few years, we took an innovative component supplier and have scaled it to a global leading player where those efficiencies should be available to us over time at our size. There is no confusion within the company in the pursuit of that goal, and we'll maximize the remainder of the portfolio as the individual contractual or strategic situations arise. The core premise of the acquisitions was to enhance the product offerings for the categories that drive our returns as well as add logical adjacencies, predicated on the same characteristics, sticky categories, low capital intensity, single-use disposables and opportunities to innovate and participate in a logical industry structure. These portfolios make sense together, and we're working on how to integrate them either literally or economically when sensible, and we're focusing on all lines to show up with improvements on the P&amp;L.While the pandemic introduced substantial volatility, strategically, we do think the weaknesses in exposed in the health care supply chain add to the argument for all participants to be healthy and stable, which has been our commentary since we became a full-line supplier. We produce essential items that require significant clinical training, hold manufacturing barriers and in general, are items that customers do not want to switch unless they must. The market needs ICU Medical to be a reliable supplier and the combination positions us better. Our company has emerged stronger from all the events of the last few years. We've gotten knocked down a bit, but we're getting closer to the top of the hill to drive value out of the combination. Thank you to all the customers, suppliers and frontline health care workers as we improve each day. Our company appreciates the role each of us must play.And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Brian Michael BonnellThanks, Vivek, and good afternoon, everyone. To begin, I'll first walk down the P&amp;L and discuss our results for the second quarter and then move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Along the way, I'll provide our updated outlook for the full year for each of these areas.So starting with the revenue line. Our second quarter 2023 GAAP revenue was $549 million compared to $561 million last year, which is down 2% on a reported basis or 1% on a constant currency basis. For your reference, the 2022 and 2023 adjusted revenue figures by business units can be found on Slide #3 of the presentation. Our adjusted revenue for the quarter was $535 million compared to $547 million last year, which is down 2% on a reported basis or 1% constant currency. Adjusted revenue for consumables was down 2% on a reported basis or 1% constant currency. Infusion Systems was up 3% reported or 5% constant currency and Vital Care was down 8% reported or 7% constant currency.As you can see from the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the press release, for the second quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 39%, compared to the first quarter gross margin of 38%, this represents a sequential improvement of 1 percentage point, driven primarily by the mix benefit from lower sales of IV Solutions. Similar to the first quarter of this year, the second quarter gross margin reflects the benefits from one reductions in expedited freight, along with lower diesel prices and lane rates; two, the impact from recently implemented price increases; and three, higher manufacturing absorption from recent increases in finished goods inventory levels.As we mentioned on our last earnings call, there are a few items that will affect gross margin over the back half of the year that will partially offset the improvements we realized during the first half. The first is the impact of lower manufacturing absorption as we continue to reduce production volumes over the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, we made progress in slowing the build of inventory levels as the Q2 increase of $27 million was roughly half of the recent historical average increase of approximately $50 million per quarter.Over the back half of the year, we expect to further slow the build of inventory levels and then maintain or even slightly reduce those levels to help drive positive free cash flow. As a result, the benefit from higher production levels as we increase inventory will not continue for the remainder of the year. The second item is the impact from scheduled plant shutdowns during the second and third quarters as part of the IT TSA separation from Smiths Group as well as the annual maintenance shutdown of the Austin IV solutions manufacturing plant as contemplated in our original guidance. So while we are pleased to see the positive trajectory in gross margins for the first half of the year, the combination of lower volumes and recent plant shutdowns will impact the rate over the remainder of the year. And as a result, we expect the full year gross margin rate to be approximately 37%, consistent with our original guidance.On previous calls, we talked about our desired long-term gross margins, and the primary drivers towards that improvement continue to be; one, manufacturing absorption benefits from volume increases towards historical levels for our acquired product lines, plus continued growth for the Legacy ICU differentiated products. Two, price increases as our multiyear contracts renew; and three, synergies from the integration of our manufacturing and distribution networks and service. And it's also worth noting, there is a high degree of variability in the gross margin rates of individual product families across our portfolio.Adjusted SG&amp;A expense was $110 million in Q2, and adjusted R&amp;D was $22 million. The adjusted operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and generally in line with Q1 and reflect acquisition synergies as well as our usual focus on SG&amp;A cost management, which has more than offset inflationary pressures. Moving forward, we expect total adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to remain around Q2 levels for the remainder of the year.Restructuring, integration and strategic transaction expenses were $12 million in the second quarter and related primarily to integration of the acquisition.Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.88 compared to $1.37 last year, an increase of 37%. The current quarter results reflect net interest expense of $24 million, which is an increase over the prior year of $9 million and equates to just under $0.30 on a per share basis.For the full year, we continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $100 million. In the second quarter, the adjusted effective tax rate was 8% and includes benefits from the release of tax contingencies as a result of the expiration of various tax statute of limitation periods, which contributed approximately $0.25 per share. We expect the second half adjusted tax rate to be more in line with our normalized tax rate of 23%.Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 24.4 million. And finally, adjusted EBITDA for Q2 increased 16% to $98 million compared to $85 million last year. Now moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the quarter, free cash flow was a net outflow of $18 million, which reflects our continued investment in the 3 key areas of the business that we highlighted for the past several calls. The first is higher levels of inventory to bolster safety stock and allow for onboarding of new customers where, as previously mentioned, we invested $27 million in additional raw materials and finished goods inventory during the quarter which is approximately half of the recent historical average.The second was quality improvement initiatives for legacy SM. And during the quarter, we spent $13 million on quality system and product-related remediation, and the third area was acquisition integration, where, as previously mentioned, we spent $12 million on restructuring and integration.Additionally, we spent $18 million on CapEx for general maintenance and capacity expansion at our facilities as well as placement of revenue-generating infusion pumps with customers outside the U.S. For the remainder of the year, the aggregate level of spending on these items will decrease with the largest decrease coming from the continued moderation of inventory builds. Additionally, we should see slightly lower spending in the back half of the year for both quality remediation and restructuring and integration, while capital expenditures will likely increase over the remainder of the year compared to a light first half with total CapEx spending for the full year estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.And just to wrap up on the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $1.6 billion of debt, and $198 million of cash and investments. Consistent with our usual cadence, we are updating our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. For the full year adjusted EBITDA, we are narrowing our previous guidance range of $375 million to $425 million to a range of $375 million to $405 million.This reduction in the top end of the previous guidance range reflects lower Vascular Access revenue relative to our original expectations, some operational flexibility as we work through aligning production with demand and the impact of lower volumes in the IV Solutions business.For the full year adjusted EPS, we are narrowing our prior guidance range of $5.75 to $7.25 per share to $6 to $6.85 per share, which includes the same drivers as adjusted EBITDA, plus the previously mentioned $0.25 tax benefit recognized in the second quarter.In summary, we feel good about the earnings we delivered for the first half of this year, and we're seeing progress on inventory levels to improve free cash flow. On the revenue line, the majority of our businesses are increasing in size, but we recognize that the score is measured on the total, and our focus is on eliminating the negatives. For gross margin, we have a number of opportunities to drive improvement over the long term. And on SG&amp;A, we've demonstrated our ability to operate efficiently. We remain convinced of the longer-term opportunity, financial returns and our ability to tackle the remaining issues. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over for any questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.Jayson Tyler BedfordMaybe I'll just focus a bit more on the revenue line, which is where I think most of the discussion will be. On the consumables, you're kind of parsing through some of the commentary there. It seems like you expect it to increase sequentially over the next couple of quarters. Just on an annual basis, is it fair to assume it will be down kind of low single digits. Is the math or assumption there, correct?Vivek JainYes. I think, Jayson, I don't think we expect it to necessarily be down year-over-year. I think we'd have a hard time saying right now that it's going to be mid-single digits like we said, we've got to obviously take [25] off of that, right? So we want to have some caution around that, right? I don't know that we have it perfect, but we'd say it's what the exact number is, but I don't think we think it's negative for the year.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. That's very helpful. On Infusion Systems...Vivek JainJust to add on that, I mean, so there's no secrets, right? The Legacy ICU Consumables piece was up 5-ish percent for the quarter, and the Smith stuff was down in the consumables line Vascular Access.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. But Vascular Access was flat sequentially. Is that correct?Vivek JainCorrect.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. Okay. Just on infusion, I was a little unclear as to just looking at it sequentially, it was down $9 million-ish. Was it just kind of the timing of capital or -- and I realize this segment can be a little bit lumpy, but was there anything that really weighed on the growth there?Vivek JainNo. Sequentially, I think it was -- we had a little bit of catch-up in Q1 on hardware placement, and we had good hardware get in Q2, but we started to ship more last quarter in the hardware, and there was some historical back orders that I think we cleared a little bit more last quarter. And we said that on the call last script that it was a high quarter for pumps.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. Okay. And then just on IV Solutions, it looks like it was down, what, $12-ish million year-over-year, depending on the assumption on the rest of the pie there. Is this just a timing dynamic? I can't imagine you're either losing share or seeding on price. If you can just -- and as add on to that. Can you just comment on the impact of the Tornado in Rocky Mount on your business?Vivek JainYes, sure. I mean I don't think we've seen any real change in long-term committed customers over the last bit of time really through the pandemic, today, things have been pretty stable. That's why we said it was just a weird -- a chunk of it was -- the biggest chunk was a weird April that didn't really come back in May or June. Another chunk of it had been Rocky has been hurting us. It's been evident in the results, $3 million, $4 million a quarter. We had anticipated it hurting us, and we have some substitutes there, but it's -- we can't imagine it's going to get better. We haven't had a final disposition from them on the Tornado. But it was a very small amount of our sales anticipated this year, but it is a couple of million bucks a quarter. We don't really have a better answer than that on solutions because your other points are right that you started the question with.OperatorThe next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.Matthew Ian MishanI wanted to ask a 2-piece on the guidance. First, I guess, just the midpoint of the guidance comes down by about $10 million. Is that just simply the Vascular Access piece, the $25 million at a decent contribution margin on kind of bringing that down? And then the second piece that I also wanted to ask was what had happened this year that could have enabled you to get to the higher end of your guidance.Vivek JainIt's a great question, Matt. On the first part, yes, you're generally directionally right on that, right? This contribution margin maybe isn't quite as robust as every piece of the infusion consumables market, but it's still pretty good. So it makes a difference. And that was important if we wanted to be at the high end. Two, as Brian said in his prepared remarks, this notion of getting everything perfect on inventory production and demand has been challenging. And so even if we feel okay about the aggregate gross margin, I think it's on our minds that it's been hard to predict everything perfectly, right? And then we always, I think, believed to get all the way to the high end also is everything on the macro had to work right, currency, broader supply chain costs, et cetera. And some of the currencies, particularly what's going on in the peso and Costa Rican Colones hurts a little bit, right? So there's some headwinds coming there. I think it's more of the macro than the stuff we operationally planned for.Matthew Ian MishanOkay. I think that's fair. And that's...Vivek JainAnd it was both reasons we gave a wide range, right? We had that conversation at the time. And I remember we had a conversation of what has to do to get all the way there. So everything has to go right, and the macro has to go, has to go right.Matthew Ian MishanAnd then there's still a lot that's still left to do as long as integration goes. I was just hoping you could help us with like the timeline of the ERP integration because it does seem as if you need to get that piece finished or at least further along before you get to that next wave of synergies like footprint and kind of supply chain.Vivek JainBrian, do you want to do that one, Brian?Brian Michael BonnellYes. I mean the IT integration is a multiyear project that we are starting to work on but it's not something that happens necessarily quickly. I would say, Matt, that as it relates to synergies, you don't have to wait until all that work is 100% complete in order to see some of the benefits. So there are some things that we can -- where we -- there is some areas where we can reduce cost as we're doing the IT integration, and there's other things that aren't necessarily predicated upon that work in order to see the benefits.Vivek JainIn the case of the Pfizer transaction, we were under a shot clock where Pfizer was no longer going to provide us systems, and we had to make all of those moves in 18 months, which I think it ultimately took 21 months-or-something to get off. here, we're kind of in month 18, and we're starting the journey of the first action was to separate and specifically where the ERP just give some examples of where it is very valuable, is things like what's our long-term warehousing and distribution model where we have our service repair model, we have a lot of duplication not only domestically, but around the planet. And when you have everything on a common order to cash infrastructure, you can kind of deal with some of those things in an easier fashion, to Brian's point, you don't have to have it, but it just makes it easier operationally. It's the right sequence of events. And there -- and we tried to get the laundry list there of whether it was manufacturing network, distribution, functional support. There's a bunch of other stuff, right, so in just real estate, we haven't gotten all of it yet.Matthew Ian MishanIs that a 2024 timeline by the time you get to that impacts '25? Or is that something which you can kind of get to at the end of this year or start to get to that could also start to benefit you in '24?Vivek JainI would say some of it. There are some announcements we've made on production that will impact '24. I think some of the items like real estate or the long-term distribution costs are probably more of an earliest late '24 or more '25 type of item, but there's a lot of stuff there.Matthew Ian MishanOn potential for portfolio rationalization, one of the things that we have seen from some of the peers has been in the ability to sell a couple of assets and the markets do seem open to that. How are you kind of looking at the portfolio and thinking about potentially a positive cash flow event from a potential asset sale like accelerating the debt pay down?Vivek JainI mean, of course, in our ideal scenario, all of those options would be available to us, right? But I think, first, we feel good about in most of the businesses we have stability, right? Things are easier to do when you can prove the business stability and things are easier to do when you have the ability to separate IT and manufacturing systems. And we've really just gotten to that point where service level is very high to the customer. There's some business stability in the majority of lines, and that gives us a little time to be introspective on it. Obviously, if the right situation was available, we would explore such an opportunity. But we haven't had so much time to deal with, yes, today.Matthew Ian MishanYes. So without talking about like timelines, how are you thinking about a submission of a new LVP pump through the FDA? I think you've seen other large players and competitors obviously have some success there now. Do you think they've kind of laid down the pathway for you or you kind of know what it takes to get through the FDA at this point? And it could be a little bit more streamlined.Vivek JainI mean, I guess, without trying to be indirect about it. We have $650 million to $700 million pump business, we're a reasonable-sized player. And obviously, a chunk of our R&amp;D spend goes into that area. The one lesson of having been in the infusion industry for a long time, we understand is, it is unpredictable what's happened at the regulatory agency. And so we would like to focus on our own product quality and our own innovation, and we'll talk about it when we have something to talk about, right? We're not a small player in this space.Operator(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.Lawrence Scott SolowGreat. I guess just a few follow-ups. I guess, just following up on the question just about the pumps, and I don't know what you can or can't say, but does -- your operations do you operate differently now that the large competitors back in the market? Is there any change in the competitive environment? I'm just trying to get any feel for what that does to you, how you react to that, if at all, or anything you could say?Vivek JainI mean I think the customers have had a belief that all market participants would be on the market eventually. And to some degree that, that has -- and that was certainly our belief, as we've said and act very directly, and to some degree, that likely stalled people's decisions on making a purchase or when not all choices were available. And so we did okay for the last time. And we always said we don't need that much, and we've clawed back a chunk of what Hospira had lost that made ICU do the transaction in the first place, but there is continued opportunity available for us. So we just hope people get on with making decisions because there's really no reason to not make a decision anymore. So we're kind of probably a bit more optimistic about it than concerned because the message to the customer as it should be from all participants was very consistent over the last years that everybody was going to be there. So everybody is there, time to get on with that.Lawrence Scott SolowOkay. That's fair. Can you just on the sort of shortfall in Vascular Access? You mentioned sort of $20 million, $25 million for the year. You also spoke to some new business that I think maybe you said it was delayed. So can you just kind of help us or tell us why it's been slower? And is it timing? Is it just your ability to get new contracts? And I guess, part 2 of that question would be as you doesn't feel your confidence has changed too much and you get into where you inevitably want to be there. So can you just kind of help us through that?Vivek JainYes. I mean this particular -- these particular lines, which are in the acquired Vascular Access category, have been in the market for many, many years with until recently a very consistent share position, but they really didn't get a lot of focus in the last 4 or 5 years and with some of the supply chain interruptions and production failures, customers were not served well and moved away from them. We never assumed that, that would all come back. We assume that some portion would come back. And it's only been a year in earnest because we only combined our commercial and R&amp;D a year ago-or-so or 14 months ago, and it just takes time. We thought a few more things would come in than did. And it was really the difference between what we thought for Q2 and this is you're trying a couple of million bucks, which means we know that there were pieces of business in the hopper, it just takes longer to get them in and implemented. But we're not talking about some assumptions over the long term that are huge shifts in market share, more subtle shifts in market share in the category that we literally connect to with our largest and most core business. So I don't think we're sitting here with some outlander set of long-term market share recapture assumptions, just takes a little bit of time to have a few points to come back in.Lawrence Scott SolowGot you. Okay. Great. Great. And then just last question maybe for Brian, just on the gross margin. So obviously, it was better this quarter than expected. It was mostly mix related. Was some of the -- I know you certainly slowed your inventory production, but had you initially expected to slow production even more in this quarter that I think your original assumptions of gross margin was going down sequentially like 100 bps instead of going up 100 bps. So I guess part of it was mix, but was part of it just a slower slowdown in production that's going to kind of be picking up more in the second half? And then I guess the other question would be just to clarify, your guidance kind of assumes a 35.5% gross margin in the back half. Is that right?Brian Michael BonnellYes. I guess, Larry, on your 2 questions there, taking the last one first. Yes, I think just the math works out such that it's around 35% gross margins in the back half of the year to get to our -- the full year of 37%. And then as it relates to the improvement, why we didn't see a decline in the second quarter, we did take action, I would say, consistent with what we had planned to do around the slowdown. It's just that the P&amp;L impact of that, there is a bit of a delay because that lower absorption as it occurs, gets capitalized on the balance sheet as inventory and then rolls out over our inventory turns, which these days are a little bit longer in the kind of 4- to 5-month range. So that's the reason why you're not seeing it in the second quarter, but we'll see it in the back half of the year.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vivek Jain for any closing remarks.Vivek JainThanks, everyone, for participating in ICU's Q2 call. We're making progress on a lot of fronts. There are a few negatives that we need to flip to positive. And we look forward to talking about it more. over the balance of the year. Thanks very much.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

A warm welcome to all the call participants. We appreciate your continued support. Today, I will summarize our second quarter 2023 highlights and priorities before I pass the call over to my team to provide some further details.Slide 5. Let me start reiterating our 2023 strategic priorities that we set at the beginning of the year and highlight our recent progress executing against that. We pursue our priority to expand and sustain our COVID-19 leadership with Pfizer by advancing our next-generational and combination vaccine candidates and by advancing key commonality features.During this quarter, we received recommendations from regulatory authorities and the World Health Organization on the composition of the adapted COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall season. Based on these recommendations, we together, with our partner, Pfizer, has submitted regulatory packages for Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies.We have also kicked off commercial launch activities for the Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Our second 2023 strategic priority is to accelerate our oncology pipeline and initiate multiple trials with registrational potential.Our new collaborations with DualityBio and OncoC4 complement our pipeline with multiple mid- to late-stage clinical programs that will help us to achieve this goal in the near term.In the second quarter at ASCO Annual Meeting, we and our respective collaboration partners presented 3 new clinical datasets that Özlem will cover later. Further, jointly with our partner OncoC4, we began a pivotal Phase III trial evaluating the next-generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody candidate BNT316 Gotistobart as a second-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Our third strategic goal is to initiate and accelerate clinical programs with high medical need in infectious diseases. We are expecting multiple data readouts for our mRNA-based vaccine candidate in the second half of this year.In summary, we continued our focused execution against strategic priorities in the second quarter and look forward to additional progress in all 3 of these areas in the remainder of this year.Slide 6, starting with COVID-19, while variants of concern has emerged in all seasons in the past 2 years, we expect that in the fall and winter in line with other common respiratory diseases such as influenza and RSV, also SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization will increase.Slide 7. In 2023, 4 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is the highest level prevalence in the global population as a result of vaccinations and/or infection. Profiles of immune responses against SARS-Cov-2 are highly heterogeneous as individuals have been infected with different variants and or vaccinated using a variety of vaccine platform.The substantial genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-Cov-2 and its spike proteins continues with divergence of the evolution of trajectory from the original (inaudible) virus. Despite increasing gaps in the genomic surveillance globally, the available sequencing data indicates that the original drivers and other early variants such as alpha, beta, gamma, delta are no longer detected in humans.As of July 2023, the XBB1 descendant lineages predominate globally, and they have further antigenic distance from previous variants. Clinical data have shown that currently approved COVID-19 vaccines provide a level of protection against this new variance. However, with the antigenic drift of current variance of concern, signs of waning protections have been observed starting 2 to 4 months after booster with last season B4/B5 adapted vaccine, including against severe COVID-19. Due to the greater antigenic distance of this variance of concern and the further immune escape, absolute vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization due to COVID-19 is reduced as time passes between vaccination and subsequent infection.In summary, this data support a rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine adapted to the most recent variance of concerns this fall. We plan to launch an Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine this fall, subject to approval by regulatory authorities.Our goal is to maintain protection against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death by providing a vaccine that is better matched to the currently circulating strain and that is designed to be more closely aligned to the newer evolving lineages.Slide 8, let me remind you of the core principles of our overarching strategy. we pursue a multi-technology driven approach rooted in deep fundamental understanding of biology and immunobiology. We leverage the power of computational science and AI. Our acquisition of InstaDeep has expanded our capabilities in that regard.Together, we aim to become the global leader in applying cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technology in research to discover, design and develop next-generation immunotherapies at scale. We build novel platforms with the ability to produce multiple product candidates for our clinical pipeline including a [purchase] that enable and accelerate individualization of treatment.To leverage synergistic mode of action, we explore opportunities for combining modalities, both developed internally and access via collaboration partnerships. Last quarter, we announced that we initiated a collaboration with Duality Biologics to access 2 of their next-generation antibody drug conjugates.This quarter, we and Duality shared clinical data from one of these programs and expanded our collaboration to a third encouraging program from Duality Biologics pipeline.Slide 9. A disease consists of 3 main components: Antibody, Linker, Payload. Each of these components has an impact on ADC's pharmacological and clinical properties. ADCs are precision medicine, allowing for targeted drug delivery, particularly to tumor cells with high specifity and potent in you cell death with the benefit of reduced off-target events.When the monoclonal antibody binds to the targets expressed on the tumor cell, the ADC is internalized allowing for the release of the cytotoxins which leads to cell death. We continue to broaden our access to ADCs because we believe this technology has the potential to replace highly toxic chemotherapy regimens to become a new combination backbone for cancer immunotherapy. Advancements in this technology have resulted in its extended use for the treatment of solid tumors.ADCs can also [synergize] with various immunotherapy modalities, including those in our current immunotherapy pipeline. Our growing ADC pipeline now includes ADCs directed against 3 distinct targets and is of interest for a broad range of cancer types.In the future, we plan to combine these ADCs with our proprietary pipeline programs to maximize the patient impact of this exciting modality. With that, I would like to thank you all for your confidence in our success and your continued support.I will now turn the call over to Özlem.Ozlem TureciThank you, Ugur. I'm delighted to speak with everyone today and to provide our pipeline update. Slide 11. Starting with our COVID-19 vaccine. We expect that as the SARS-Cov-2 continues to evolve and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death continues, there will be persisting demand for vaccine boosting and vaccinations, especially for at-risk and immunocompromised groups.The Omicron XBB sublineages currently account for the majority of COVID-19 cases globally and are antigenically distant from prior circulating SARS-Cov-2 lineages, including Omicron BA4/5 and original SARS-CoV-2 strain.Although Omicron BA4/5 adapted bivalent vaccines provide some protection against the range of outcomes from XBB-related COVID-19, evidence suggests that vaccine better match to currently circulating sublineages can help further improve protection against symptomatic disease and severe COVID-19.XBB lineage viruses have reduced neutralization in comparison to earlier Omicron lineages but have similar neutralization profiles to each other. Despite sequence of XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 differ in only 2 mutations highlighted here.In May, the EMA and other health authorities provided guidance highlighting that updated vaccines targeting Omicron XBB 1 sublineages may help to maintain protection against COVID-19 during the upcoming fall and winter season, when COVID-19 case rates and hospitalizations are expected to increase.Also, the FDA vaccines and related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, issued guidance recommending manufacture of an Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023 and 2024 fall and winter seasons.We and Pfizer submitted regulatory applications to the EMA and to the FDA for our Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for individual 6 months of age and older. Following guidance from regulatory authorities on the requirements for strain changes, where applications include data suggesting that Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine may generate improved responses against circulating XBB sublineages compared to the current Omicron BA4/5 adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine.Moving to Slide 12. We and our partner, Pfizer, tested the potential effectiveness of an Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent vaccine as a primary series and booster in mice. Here, you see the neutralizing antibody response in mice immunized with Omicron BA4/5 adapted bivalent vaccines as booster after 2 doses of original vaccine.One group of mice again received a BA4/5 adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a fourth dose, and the other group received the new XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine as a fourth dose. You can see a 4- to 5-fold increase of neutralization of several XBB-related variants when dose 4 is the XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent vaccine as compared to last season bivalent vaccine, indicating that XBB.1.5 variant adapted monovalent vaccine in the prevaccinated setting has the potential to induce broad cross neutralizing antibody titers against multiple XBB sublineages.We made significant progress towards monovalent COVID-19 vaccine against Omicron XBB.1.5 with regulatory submissions to the U.S. FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities, and we are well prepared to launch an adapted COVID-19 vaccine if approved in early fall this year.Moving to our oncology pipeline. Let me put our second quarter pipeline advancements into the broader context of our clinical stage pipeline, which is depicted on Slide 13.In the second quarter, the initiation of our pivotal Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer marks the first landmark in our strategic collaboration with OncoC4. The randomized Phase III trial is evaluating BNT316, the pH sensitive anti-CTLA-4 antibody with distinctive mode of action and is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients with metastatic immunotherapy-resistant non-small cell lung cancer.The trial initiation follows for FDA Fast Track designation granted in 2022 and is based on Phase I/II safety and efficacy data for the monotherapy in metastatic immune checkpoint inhibitor-resistant non-small cell lung cancer.Further, we expanded our collaboration with Duality and added a third ADC to our oncology pipeline. DB-1305 is currently in a Phase I/II clinical trial for solid tumors. Then I have news from BNT116, our lung cancer antigen-based FixVac candidate.A second trial with BNT116 has dosed its first patient end of July. Together with our partner, Regeneron, we will evaluate BNT116 in combination with cemiplimab versus cemiplimab monotherapy alone in treatment-naive patients with Stage IIIB, Stage IIIC or Stage IV squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients with at least 50% PD-L1 expression in a randomized multicenter open-label Phase II study.The Phase I clinical trial is ongoing with BNT116 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of BNT116 alone and in combination with cemiplimab in patients who have progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor treatment or are not eligible for chemotherapy and in combination with docetaxel in patients who have received prior PD-1 inhibitor therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy.We are planning to start several trials with our partners imminently. Firstly, building on compelling Phase I data in patients with resectable PDAC in the adjuvant setting that we recently reported in Nature, a Phase II trial with Autogene cevumeran BNT122, our individualized cancer vaccine candidate is planned with our partner, Genentech, evaluating the efficacy and safety of autogene cevumeran in combination with atezolizumab and modified FOLFIRINOX compared to modified FOLFIRINOX as standard of care alone.Second, another trial is planned to start with our second ADC developed by DualityBio. BNT324 is a humanized antibody conjugated to a novel DNA Topoisomerase 1 inhibitor via cleavable linker. The Phase I part of the study will evaluate the safety in all comers and determine the recommended Phase II dose. In the Phase II dose expansion part, we aim to evaluate safety and efficacy in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors.On the next couple of slides, I want to summarize the recently presented data from 3 of our programs at the ASCO Annual Meeting.On Slide 14, starting with BNT316 ONC-392. Antibody targeting of CTLA-4 works primarily by depleting regulatory T cells and thus, the suppression of tumor-specific immunity. Physiologically, CTLA-4 recycles continuously between the self-service in the endosome. Interruption of this process by a binding antibody is associated with the development of autoimmunity.Autoimmunity and immune-related adverse events are a major limitation of approved anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that disrupt CTLA-4 recycling by promoting lysosomal degradation of its important immune checkpoint molecule. BNT316 in contrast dissociates from the CTLA molecule in the endosome, allows normal recycling of both the antibody and the CTLA-4 molecule and thus is designed for stronger cancer therapeutic effect and less immune-related adverse effects. Preliminary data showed that BNT316 is well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities.The single-agent recommended Phase II dose was determined to be 10 mg per kg without MTD being reached. Severe immune-related grade 3 adverse event rate in the combo dose escalation with pembrolizumab was 23%, which is considered lower than what was reported for comparable IO-IO combination. The recommended Phase II dose for combination is 6 mg per kg.Overall, BNT316 dosed as monotherapy and in combination was well tolerated, and the safety profile appears to allow higher dosing for a longer duration of treatment as compared, for example, to ipilimumab. Early efficacy data as monotherapy and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients and in combination with pembrolizumab in multiple solid tumors were promising.Slide 15. With our colleagues from OncoC4, we presented data from the Phase I/II study, investigating BNT316 in 35 non-small cell lung cancer patients with metastatic lesions that progressed on immune checkpoint inhibition in previous lines. The majority of patients had an ECOG [intensity] of 1. The objective response rate was about 30% and disease control rate was 70%. Patients that responded to BNT316 had previously failed multiple lines of treatment, including several immune checkpoint inhibitors.In this cohort, BNT316 has shown manageable safety and tolerability when dosed at 10 mg per kg twice and followed with 6 mg per kg every 3 weeks. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3/4 were observed in 34% of patients and included immune-mediated colitis ALT/AST increase and immune hepatitis.Our findings support the further development of BNT316 in non-small cell lung cancer in the Phase III study, preserve-free.Slide 16. Our second presentation at ASCO was together with our colleagues from DualityBio and about our first clinical data for BNT323, our next-generation HER2-targeting ADC. BNT323 is comprised of a HER2-targeting antibody, covalently linked to the proprietary DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor via a cleavable linker.Approved ADCs have shown antitumor activity and clinical benefit in multiple types of cancer. And we believe that midterm ADCs as a modality will become a broadly used backbone for combos in oncology. More efficacious and safer anti-HER2 ADCs for example, regarding potential lung toxicity may add further clinical benefit.Preclinical data for BNT323 distracted significantly improved therapeutic window as compared DS-8201a or TDM-1 analogues to approved HER2 ADC Trastuzumab deruxtecan and Trastuzumab-Emtansin respectively.BNT323 has a high drug-to-antibody ratio and when incubated with red monkey and human plasma demonstrated outstanding plasma stability. In HER2 positive and HER2 negative mixed cell cultures, BNT323 inhibited the proliferation of both cell types, demonstrating its bystander effect.Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of BNT323 and xenograft mouse models showed targeted delivery of the toxin into tumor tissue. In vivo studies in monkeys showed a superior stability of BNT323 and rapid systemic clearance of the toxin. Altogether, these properties result in maintenance of efficacy and reduction of systemic toxicity in animal models.Slide 17. The program has received Fast Track designation from the FDA and is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. The study is enrolling pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 targetable solid tumors. HER2 status is identified via IHC or ISH for expression level via NGS for HER2 amplification or HER2 mutation.The majority of patients had the HER2 expression by IHC of 2 plus of status. We showed preliminary antitumor activity in heavily pretreated HER2-expressing patients with a median of 7 prior systemic treatment lines, including other anti-HER2 ADCs, anti-HER2 antibody therapy or anti-HER2 TKI therapy. In HER2-positive breast cancer patients for objective response rate is 50%, the disease control rate is 96%. In HER2 low breast cancer patients, objective response rate is 38%, the disease control rate is 84%. Antitumor activity of BNT323 was also observed in non-breast cancer tumor types, such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer.Responses were observed in patients treated with different dose levels and HER2 expression status. BNT323 was well tolerated and all adverse events were manageable so far. Interstitial lung disease of grade 1 occurred in 2 patients out of 85 patients.Expansion cohorts are ongoing in selected tumor patients treated at recombinant Phase II dose, and we expect further data this year.Slide 18. Finally, we presented data on our cell therapy product candidate BNT211. We developed a highly sensitive second-generation CAR targeting CLDN6 with high specificity. The carcinoembryonic antigen CLDN6 is an ideal target for cell therapy as it is absent in healthy tissues, but highly expressed in many high medical need cancers.To improve CAR T cell engraftment and persistence, we codeveloped a CAR T cell amplifying RNA vaccine or CARVac for short. The goal is to keep CAR T cells at therapeutically relevant levels. In animal studies, we have shown that the persistence and effector function of CAR T cells can be further enhanced by repeated administration of CARVac, a nanoparticular RNA vaccine that encodes CLDN6. CARVac is based on our uridine nucleotide mRNA (inaudible) vaccine technology and mediates body-wide RNA delivery to lymphoid compartment resident antigen presenting cell.In multiple preclinical models, the display of the translated natively folded CAR target protein on antigen-presenting cells, mediated in vivo stimulation and controlled expansion of CAR T cells, induced a memory T cell phenotype along with higher target sensitivity and enabled tumor control even if subtherapeutic CAR T cells doses were administered.We are testing the safety, tolerability and activity of a combination of CLDN6 CAR T sets and CARVac in a bifurcated dose escalation study with increasing dose levels of CAR T cells and the fixed CARVac schedule in patients with various cancer types that are CLDN6 positives defined as more than 50% of tumor cells with 2 to 3 plus intensity.A dose escalation has been completed for CAR T cells derived from a manual manufacturing process, and we have presented data with highly encouraging signs of clinical activity and manageable safety at various conferences in the past. Slide 19. A subsequent cohort of [19] patients have been treated with a CAR T product manufactured with a scalable automated version of the process. No DLTs have been observed so far. And CLDN6 CAR T cell as well as CARVac were well tolerated, reflecting the safety profile detected in the first dose escalation level.The objective response rate was 41% for all 17 evaluable patients and 75% for 8 patients treated at dose level 2, namely 1 times 10 to the eight CAR T set.Next to germ cell tumors, which dominated the first dose escalation, we observed ovarian cancer patients responding. We are expecting an additional data readout later this year. Once we have determined the recommended Phase II dose for BNT211, we plan to initiate a pivotal trial in germ cell tumors which has already received prime designation by the EMA. Advancing our pipeline remains a key strategic priority for the year. This end next year, we plan to transform our pipeline as we advance multiple programs towards the pivotal stage.I will now pass the presentation to our CFO, Jens Holstein.Jens H. HolsteinThank you, Özlem, and a warm welcome to everyone who dialed into today's call. Before we go into the financial details for the second quarter and the first half of 2023, I'll start with giving you an overview on some key financial figures, which you can find on the next slide.Our total revenues reached EUR 1.4 billion for the first half of 2023 and are in line with our expectations with Q2 being the expected weakest quarter in the year.Our COVID-19 vaccine revenues, are as stated and expected before, heavily influenced by seasonal effects, especially now as we have summer in our biggest markets in the Northern Hemisphere. As we have outlined in earlier earnings calls, the revenue development for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to mimic a flu-like setting.I will go into more details concerning our financial guidance in the course of the call, but I want to emphasize already now that acknowledging the uncertainties related to the seasonal effect we reiterate our 2023 COVID-19 vaccine revenue guidance of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year.With EUR 1.4 billion in revenues, we ended the first 6 months of 2023 with an operating result of EUR 91.1 million and generated earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of EUR 1.28. With respect to the company's financial position, we ended the second quarter of 2023 with EUR 16.8 billion, comprising approximately EUR 14.2 billion cash and cash equivalents as well as approximately EUR 2.7 billion, partly current and partly noncurrent security investments, which are part of our investment strategy.Subsequent to the end of the quarter in July 2023, we received EUR 1.1 billion in cash from our collaboration partner, Pfizer, settling our gross profit share for the first quarter of 2023, alongside with EUR 0.4 million (sic) [EUR 0.4 billion] received until early August in connection with the amended COVID-19 vaccine purchase agreement with the European Commission.In connection with our acquisition of InstaDeep which closed on July 31, approximately EUR 450 million were invested in form of cash and shares, not including potential future milestones. Overall, with this strong cash position in the background, we are on track to launch our new variant adapted COVID-19 vaccine and intend to start multiple clinical trials across our oncology and infectious disease pipeline such as the ones with OncoC4 and Duality Biologics that Ugur just mentioned earlier.I'll be moving to our financial results for the second quarter of 2023, as shown on the next slide. Our total revenues reported reached EUR 166.4 million for the second quarter compared to EUR 3.2 billion for the comparative prior year period and decreased with the corresponded lower COVID-19 vaccine market demand. Write-offs by our collaboration partner, Pfizer, significantly reduced our gross profit share in the second quarter and hence negatively influenced our revenues for the 3 months ended June 2023.Let me move to cost of sales, which amounted to EUR 162.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 764.6 million for the comparative prior year period. For the first 6 months of 2023, the cost of sales reached EUR 258.9 million compared to EUR 2.1 billion for the comparative prior year period. The change is in line with decreasing COVID-19 vaccine sales.Research and development expenses reached EUR 373.4 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 399.6 million for the comparative prior year period. For the first 6 months of 2023, research and development expenses amounted to EUR 707.4 million compared to EUR 685.4 million for the comparative prior year period.Our R&amp;D expenses are mainly influenced by progressing clinical studies for pipeline candidates, the development of variant adapted as well as next-generation COVID-19 vaccines and the expansion of our R&amp;D headcount.General and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 122.7 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 130 million for the comparative prior year period. For the first 6 months of 2023, G&amp;A expenses reached EUR 242.1 million compared to EUR 220.8 million for the comparative prior year period. While in Q2, some cost savings have been achieved, G&amp;A expenses for the first 6 months were mainly influenced by increased expenses for IT services as well as expanding the G&amp;A head count.Due to a loss-making second quarter of 2023 and the tax effect of a reorganization of the intellectual property rights within the group, income taxes with an amount of EUR 221.8 million were realized compared to tax expenses of EUR 647.3 million accrued for the comparative prior year period.In total, for the first 6 months of 2023, income taxes were realized with an amount of EUR 16.3 million tax income compared to EUR 2 billion tax expenses accrued for the comparative prior year period. The derived effective income tax rate for the first 6 months of 2023 was approximately minus 5.5% which is expected to change over the 2023 financial year to be in line with the updated estimated annual cash effective income tax rate of somewhere around 21% for the BioNTech Group, an improvement that I will elaborate on in a minute.As mentioned at the beginning, due to mainly seasonal effect of our COVID business, we recognized a loss during the second quarter of 2023, amounting to EUR 190.4 million compared to EUR 1.7 billion net profit for the comparative prior year period. For the first 6 months of 2023, net profit reached EUR 311.8 million compared to EUR 5.4 billion for the comparative prior year period.Our loss per share for the second quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR 0.79 compared to a diluted earnings per share of EUR 6.44 for the comparative prior year period. For the first 6 months of 2023, our diluted earnings per share was EUR 1.28 compared to EUR 20.65 for the comparative prior year period.Now turning to the next slide, I would like to emphasize that we are updating the company's financial outlook for the 2023 financial year with respect to our planned full year R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses as well as our planned expenses and growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities, excluding effects caused by or driven from in-licensing arrangements, collaborations or M&amp;A transactions.Please note that the following numbers reflect current base -- case projections and are calculated based on constant currency rates and do not include further transactions that could occur in the second half of 2023. As stated before, we reiterate our estimated COVID-19 vaccine revenues of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. Our guidance is based on the expectation that the demand in our vaccine will pick up in the year's third and fourth quarter along with our rollout of the adapted COVID-19 vaccine against XBB.1.5.During the second quarter of 2023, the COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement with the European Commission has been amended. The agreed rephasing of deliveries annually through 2026 will play an important role in the future as revenues will be recognized on the expanded term.With the EC contract, giving us a level of clarity in terms of revenue expectations, the demand and vaccination rates in other territories, as for example, the U.S. market remain uncertain regarding these metrics. Our collaboration partner, Pfizer, concerned its plans to achieve its goals for their market. Given their detailed plans to support an increase in vaccination rates in the U.S., we expect to achieve our revenue guidance range as previously mentioned. However, substantial uncertainties underlie the demand for COVID-19 vaccines in general as well as for our vaccine e.g the timing of its approval will have an impact on its demand.There have been no precedent on how COVID-19 vaccine rates will evolve after years of a pandemic where people have been vaccinated multiple times. We expect to learn from this for future years, but we assume that 2023 will be a very special one, given the mentioned circumstances. It is our aim to move our clinical programs forward as quickly yet cost efficiently as possible towards becoming a multiproduct company.To do so, we have implemented further measures to increase cost consciousness, which led to a company-wide cost optimization and hence, a reduction of our expected 2023 R&amp;D, SG&amp;A spend and capital expenditures. The increased flexibility at expenditure level will help us navigate for the just described uncertainties while remaining focused on the development of the next wave of innovation in various fields and indications.As summarized for you on this slide, we update our R&amp;D spending for the rest of 2023 from between EUR 2.4 billion and EUR 2.6 billion to between EUR 2 billion and EUR 2.2 billion including the R&amp;D development costs identified from our latest publicly announced M&amp;A activities.We also updated our SG&amp;A expenses from between EUR 650 million to EUR 750 million now to between EUR 600 million and EUR 700 million and reduce our spending for growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities from between EUR 500 million to EUR 600 million to between EUR 350 million and EUR 450 million.As noted before, we have updated our group estimated annual cash effective income tax rate from around 27% to around 21%, excluding potential effects from share-based payment settlements in the course of 2023. Following the reorganization of the intellectual property rights within the group, we recognized deferred tax effects in Germany and the U.S. Previously unrecognized U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, including unused tax losses and unused tax credits have been reevaluated and now recognized. The recognition of these deferred tax assets lead to a decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year of 2023.And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Strategy Officer, Ryan Richardson, for an update on our strategic outlook for 2023 and concluding remarks. Thank you.Ryan RichardsonThank you, Jens. I'll now provide a brief summary of the commercial outlook for our updated COVID-19 vaccine launch and provide an update on our acquisition of InstaDeep before concluding with our strategic outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond.I would like to touch on our key readiness activities that have put us in a strong position to execute on our planned launch this fall. On the back of the regulatory recommendation for an XBB.1.5-adaptive monovalent vaccine, we and Pfizer have made more than 40 regulatory submissions in key geographies around the world. We are on track to begin vaccine distribution once regulatory approval is received with first shipments expected from September onwards.We believe Comirnaty is positioned to maintain its leading position in multiple key geographies. Most of the world will continue to be supplied under existing pandemic booster contracts. This includes our contract with the European Union, our largest contract, which was recently renegotiated to extend to a period over 4 years. In the United States, we expect our first major commercial market opening, where we will leverage Pfizer's commercial capabilities.Turning to the next slide. This week, we announced that our acquisition of InstaDeep has closed following receipt of all required approvals. With the acquisition, we add world-class AI and machine learning technologies and research capabilities to accelerate and enhance our broader strategic vision. The acquisition will bring over 290 data scientists, ML engineers and tech professionals to our team, positioning us to lead in this disruptive new field.In combining InstaDeep's AI and ML expertise with our own research and development capabilities, we aim to develop novel therapeutic and vaccine product candidates with increased speed and efficiency. We also see opportunities to leverage these AI and ML capabilities outside of R&amp;D across other functions of BioNTech. This makes this a highly strategic acquisition with significant long-term transformational potential across our firm. We will operate InstaDeep as an independent technology subsidiary of BioNTech.On the next slide, we show the 3 pillars of value creation that we expect from this transaction. The first is to apply cutting-edge AI and machine-learning technologies across our therapeutic and vaccine platforms. We plan to connect these AI-enabled discovery capabilities with automated lab infrastructure to enable high throughput drug discovery. While we do expect our overall AI investments to increase in the coming years, we do expect some midterm cost efficiencies from the acquisition by internalizing our largest AI technology and services provider.Finally, we will continue to operate InstaDeep's third-party business, which delivers technology solutions and services to external customers in the technology sector and other industries. We are excited to kick off the next phase of our collaboration with the leadership and bright minds at InstaDeep and believe that together, we can become a global leader in applying cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies to discover, design and develop next-generation immunotherapies at scale.The next slide provides an overview of our expected pipeline news flow for 2023 and 2024. Some of these points have been covered, so I won't go through them all in detail here. With the collective efforts and dedication from our teams, we have achieved remarkable progress for several of our product candidates. At this year's ASCO Congress, we presented data for 3 of our pipeline candidates. We're on track to share additional data updates across a range of technologies later this year.In June, we initiated our first Phase III trial in oncology. Additionally, we started a Phase II trial for one of our FixVac candidates in collaboration with Regeneron, focusing on first-line NSCLC. As Özlem has elaborated, we anticipate initiating several further trials in the near future.On the next slide, I'll summarize the strategic outlook for the remainder of the year. We are on track to roll out our new variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccine in the coming month. We also plan to initiate multiple registrational oncology clinical trials while expanding our infectious disease pipeline.With the InstaDeep acquisition now closed, we intend to rapidly scale up our activity in AI-enabled drug discovery, and we'll continue to execute transactions to expand our innovation ecosystem and execute on our corporate development strategy to in-license complementary assets.Before concluding and opening up the floor for questions, I'd like to reiterate that we will hold our Innovation Series event on November 7. We'll provide further details on the event in the coming weeks.With that, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the floor for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners.Daina Michelle GrayboschYes. I have one ONC-392. The Phase III that you have started, I forget the name of it, is different in design from the Phase II and some of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. And I wonder if you could talk about why the difference is? And why you decided to go forward now in a Phase III with single-agent CTLA-4 rather than gathering more data and doing a combination study with PD-1 or any other agents in this pretty hard-to-treat and difficult-to-do trial setting?Ugur SahinDaina, Hi. This is Ugur. Thank you for the question. So as you know, in the Phase I/II study collected data in different combinations and we have seen single compound activity in non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have received and progressed under first-line checkpoint blockade treatment. These were encouraging objective response rate around 35%. We do not see an added benefit in combining that with the current status quo, which is chemotherapy and therefore, decided in also with favoring clean safety profile to go with a single compound alone. And patient population that have been selected for the study reflects historical patient populations with regard to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.Daina Michelle GrayboschOkay. Perhaps a follow-up. I think the difference, and tell me if I'm wrong, was the length for which the patients could have received a prior checkpoint that it's a lot -- you're requiring a longer prior checkpoint than you in Phase III than you did in the Phase II. So some Phase II patients, wouldn't be eligible for Phase III, do you expect any negative impact from?Ugur SahinYes. Daina -- and the protocol has also emerged based on discussions with the FDA and FDA request.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.Tazeen AhmadJust a point of clarification. As you think about the rest of the year for COVID vaccine sales, I know you talked about the difficulties involved in really getting a sense for the trends. But when you decided to maintain guidance at least for now, what key factors are you taking into account that gives you confidence that sales will be -- or revenues rather will be at least close to, if not at the EUR 5 billion mark? And I think that's probably the best question for Ryan to answer.Ryan RichardsonYes, I'll start, Tazeen, and Jens should also chime in here. So I think the starting point here was that we are expecting the total volume of COVID vaccines in the fall to be down. You may remember that last year, we had distributed more than 500 million doses of our B4/B5 variance-adaptive vaccine globally. And for the full year last year, we had -- the market in the United States was about 144 million doses. We are expecting those numbers to come down, both in the United States and globally.So we factor that in. However, we also expect that -- in the United States that we're going to see a commercial market opening, so a higher price pool. We along With Pfizer, have talked about a gross price in the $110 to $130 range. That's our expectation. And so a higher price point in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world, we're still expecting contracts that have already been signed to be the primary sort of contractual mode governing the second half deliveries, but demand will still matter. So in the rest of the world, we're still expecting effectively a continuation of the booster contracts, and that's factored in as well.Jens H. HolsteinYes. Maybe Tazeen, just to add, I mean, Ryan basically described the situation. And I think we made some statements in our speeches as well in that respect. But of course, a situation like we currently see hasn't been seen before for any product so far. Patients have received and people have received multiple vaccinations in the last 2 years. And of course, there is some level of tiredness, so to say, on getting vaccinated.And -- but we see the need for further vaccinations. And I think specifically for the U.S., you've heard probably some of the clients that Pfizer and as well as our competitor, Moderna has announced them, how the expectations will be going up for the rest of the year to pick up with the vaccination rates.So in that respect, the next couple of months, the next 2, 3 months will give us a good sign, how the year will end. There is some uncertainty. We just wanted to make that clear. And we see 2023 as a very special year, though, too, I have to say. So from our perspective, that situation that people have received multiple vaccinations and now are maybe a little bit tired, have to grow into a market where you have annual vaccinations. And I think it gives -- '23 gives us some indication, but we also believe there will be a further increased potential from our perspective for '24 and the outer years just given the specific situation that we now have in this year with 2 years of multiple vaccinations for people.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari from Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is Amy on for Akash. So Pfizer has alluded to an enterprise-wide cost-cutting program, particularly around COVID is long-term vaccine demand ends up being modest. How would Pfizer's cost cut change your long-term OpEx on your COVID programs and spend more broadly? And on a related note, can you go over what's changed in your new 2023 OpEx and CapEx guide? We're seeing that BNT141 isn't on your pipeline slide this quarter. Are there any other components that may be driving these cost cuts?Ryan RichardsonYes. Thank you for the question. So I'll speak to the OpEx point and then I'll ask Jens to opine on what's driving the cost lines in our guidance. But on the OpEx side, the short answer is no. And actually, one of the unique features of our -- of our economic model for COVID-19 is that our OpEx is very lean. So as you may recall, we get a gross profit share on every COVID vaccine dose produced and delivered through the Pfizer partnership.And only in Germany and Turkey, do we book top line product sales and actually have a significant OpEx only in those 2 countries. So that does translate into a very differentiated profile across our P&amp;L. And I think you see some of that leanness reflected in the numbers that we've disclosed today. Jens, do you want to speak to the drivers of the cost that you expect?Jens H. HolsteinYes. I mean from -- for us, we, of course, can only talk for us, yes, and we cannot talk about Pfizer and their cost-cutting plans that they have announced in their earnings call. So from our perspective, we see a little bit less spend for the collaboration with Pfizer in the course of 2023. But we also have a close look on our own spending in the areas of oncology, for example, or in building up production capacities. So those have been specific areas where we just look at controlling our costs going forward to have more flexibility.OperatorAnd the question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.Chris ShibutaniYes. Two questions, if I can. One on the pipeline and the other more financially related. On the pipeline, BNT122 first-line metastatic melanoma seemed a bit conspicuous in terms of the absence of mentioned in the press release and in prepared comments. I do see it in the pipeline table. Have your expectations for this trial changed? I believe we should still be expecting updates in the balance of this year. And then I'll have a follow-up on financial.Ryan RichardsonYes. Thanks, Chris. Let me start on the BNT122 and Ugur and Özlem can also chime in here. So we've reiterated our guidance for an update later this year. We still intend to provide that. I think on a previous call, we had also mentioned that the full -- the PFS analysis would be triggered on an event basis. And the fact is we still haven't met that event trigger -- reached that event trigger, which does mean that we're not in a position right now to be specific about the full -- the data that we're likely to bring out later this year. So we do intend to provide an update before year-end, but I think it's likely that there won't be a full data update. So more to come on that.Ozlem TureciYes. I can just echo what Ryan said. Gathering these events is not entirely under our control. And therefore, we, at this point, cannot forecast when we will be able to report the data -- interim analysis data point.Chris ShibutaniGot it. And then on the financial follow-up. Very healthy cash balance, obviously, post COVID, and we are watching the decisions you're making on the capital allocation front. The InstaDeep is an example of that. And Ryan, you mentioned during the call, you look to intend to continue to in-license assets.Can you give us a sense for potentially any areas that you feel either disease area, modality size. A lot of these have been smaller and InstaDeep was a little bit more kind of adjacent as opposed to immediately obvious. Just be helpful to get a sense for what this mosaic is that you're creating given your capacity?Ryan RichardsonYes, absolutely. Absolutely, Chris. So as you see from the deals we've announced so far this year that we've allocated a little bit less than $1 billion in terms of upfront payments across the InstaDeep transaction and then several in-licensing deals for several assets that we talked about today. So I think in that sense, InstaDeep was a sort of strategic exception. We thought that was a very unique opportunity.I wouldn't expect that, that would be one that would be replicated as such, but I think the licensing deals and small-scale M&amp;A, I think you can expect us to continue to operate along the same lines as what you've seen so far in the first half of the year. So relatively small deals, those are at our sweet spot, under $1 billion is our sweet spot. We will look at and consider larger deals, but that's I think it has to be a very, very good strategic fit for us to make a larger move. We do see opportunities in that sub-$1 billion range to further bolster the pipeline. And in terms of focus areas, as you've seen so far in the first half, IO -- differentiated I/O assets are going to continue to be an area of focus.Chris ShibutaniGreat. Will look for more insights on your innovation day.Ryan RichardsonThank you.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from TD Cowen.Unidentified AnalystThis is Brendan on for Yaron. Just really quickly, I wanted to also ask maybe about the potential flu-COVID combo approach here. First, I guess, when you think we might see data from that study, but also maybe a little bit more broadly, kind of what the path forward is for this combo. And really, I guess, trying to understand with each updated booster, how this would kind of play out here. Just kind of trying to get at Sanofi kind of cast some doubt a little bit on the whole mRNA approach, obviously, from their own perspective, but really how you're kind of thinking about mRNA fitting into whole COVID-flu combo space from what you're seeing at this point?Ryan RichardsonYes, sure. I'll start. So as you know, Pfizer currently has an ongoing Phase I study of a flu-COVID combo vaccine, and they also have a Phase III study ongoing of their mRNA-flu vaccine, which we've licensed the technology to them. We still retain some economics on the program, but they're in control in driving that program forward, the mono program.So we do see opportunity for a combination vaccine. I think in terms of timeline, Pfizer has guided to a potential Phase I data update this year for the combination. And they've also guided to near-term Phase III data on the flu mono, both of which I think will be relevant data points here to help inform the next stage of development.The last point I would add is just that Pfizer has indicated, I think, just the last couple of days that -- or they've reiterated that they see a flu -- both a flu mono and also flu-COVID combo being -- starting to become relevant from 2024 onwards. So not something to look at this year, although I think positive data could obviously be a helpful catalyst for us as well.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.Terence C. FlynnJust was wondering if you could elaborate more on the rationale to advance BNT116 into the metastatic setting well in iNeST, I know you've talked more about the potential there in the adjuvant setting. So just wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast those 2 approaches?Ugur SahinYes. Thank you. The question is highly relevant. It's a six pack approach -- is based on the off-the-shelve availability of the vaccines. That means in the metastatic setting the disease is rapidly progressing, we would like to get as quickly as possible an immune response initiated and personalized vaccine, [in 116] approach requires around 4 to 6 weeks for a preparation of the vaccine and is particularly suited for the adjuvant setting. And because in the adjuvant setting, there is a longer time frame before patients progress. So that gives us the opportunity to build an immune response that can counteract potential progression of the disease.Therefore, all these adjuvant types will have as an end point relapse-free survival as an endpoint, whereas in the metastatic setting, endpoints will be, for example, progression-free survival or OS.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Bill Maughan from Canaccord.William Patrick MaughanSo I have a question on self-amplifying RNA. I know that you had been developing a few programs with yourself implying RNA, and it's kind of not center stage anymore with several other companies that are earlier in their cancer vaccine development are using self-amplifying RNA and kind of singing its praises. So I was just wondering if we could expect self-amplifying RNA to occupy more of the spotlight and maybe be advanced in some programs coming up in the future?Ugur SahinYes. Thank you for the question. As you know, we have 2 mRNA amplification program, it's a self-amplifying mRNA program as well as the trans-Amplification program. We have observed and if you look closer into the data -- into publish data of (inaudible) we have observed that the self-amplifying mRNA in humans are limited in the full response on innate, quick initiation of innate response and hindering the full capacity of self-amplifying mRNA.And we are working on an improved approach of overcoming this innate immune response limitation on a trans-amplifying mRNA platform, which comes -- which combines 2 advantages, the advantage of safety.So the replicate itself is not amplified. It provides only trans-mRNA activity and the target mRNAs are amplified. We thereby separate the target mRNA and the replicate mRNA and have the opportunity to combine multiple targets. And this is something where we made a lot of progress in the preclinical setting, and we will report end of this year here on this platform, particularly we see their suitability in the impacted disease setting, particularly in the setting of combination vaccine.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ellie Merle from UBS.Unidentified AnalystThis is Sarah on for Ellie. I guess a quick one on 211 and the data update later this year. What are the expectations for data there? And what are you guys hoping to see?Ozlem TureciThank you for the question. So we have an ongoing Phase I/II trial, and we have had a couple of data updates this year, the year before. And the trial is ongoing. What we expect report end of this year is additional data on the 1 hand, on safety of different doses and in combination with our CARVac vaccine, also data on clinical activity in additional clinical indications. We have been very focused on testicular cancer in the previous updates.Further, we will report on durability of these responses. We have been focused on objective response rates. Now that the data is maturing, we will provide more insights into durability of those responses and how use of a vaccine impacts that.OperatorWe will now take our last question for today. And your last question comes from the line of Simon Baker from Redburn.Simon P. BakerIt relates to the PRESERVE-003 study. It's a 2-stage Phase III study. So I just wanted to get some idea of what data you will be presenting at the conclusion of Stage 1 and any timing that is indicated based on your expectations for (inaudible) and treatment? And I see the clinical trials is showing a primary completion in mid-2026. Is that a reasonable estimate at this stage for the final data of Stage 2?Ozlem TureciI didn't fully get that, Simon. Was this about data expectations for the ongoing ONC392 trial?Simon P. BakerYes, it was because it's a 2-stage study. So I wondered what data you will disclose when Stage I is completed and the dose is selected?Ozlem TureciSo it will be safety data and clinical activity data in different tumor indications.Ugur SahinNo, no, this is -- I think it's a lung cancer trial...Ozlem TureciSorry, I didn't get that.Ugur SahinSo we expect around 2025 [ORR] data and safety data. Now we have started the clinical trial with 2 different doses. We will select one dose to continue. And it's a stage approach based on the OR data, initial assessment of the PFS that clinical trial will continue for full maturation.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Affiliate fee revenues increased 3%, driven by 9% growth at the Television segment. Advertising revenues decreased 4% as continued growth at Tubi was more than offset by comparably lower political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations and the impact of elevated supply in the direct response marketplace at FOX News Media.

Other revenues increased 5%, driven by the full year impact of the prior year consolidation of entertainment production companies and higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.The Company reported full year net income of $1.25 billion as compared to the $1.23 billion reported in the prior year. The variance includes charges associated with legal settlement costs at FOX News Media and the change in fair value of the Company's investments recognized in Other, net.

stockholders excluding net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net, and tax provision adjustments (""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted EPS"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management, investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Three Months EndedJune 30, 2023June 30, 2022IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$         369$         308Less: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests6(2)Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders$         375$       0.74$         306$       0.55Impairment and restructuring charges990.20——Other, net5(10)(0.02)1350.24Tax provision(21)(0.04)(28)(0.05)As adjusted$         443$       0.88$         413$       0.74The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Twelve Months EndedJune 30, 2023June 30, 2022IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$     1,253$     1,233Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(14)(28)Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders$     1,239$       2.33$     1,205$       2.11Impairment and restructuring charges1110.21——Other, net67031.325130.90Tax provision(187)(0.35)(127)(0.22)As adjusted$     1,866$       3.51$     1,591$       2.79NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2023:Three Months Ended June 30,Twelve Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022$ MillionsNet Income$         369$         308$     1,253$     1,233Add:Amortization of cable distribution investments441618Depreciation and amortization10399411363Impairment and restructuring charges99—111—Interest expense, net3586218371Other, net7(11)134699509Income tax expense136139483461Adjusted EBITDA$         735$         770$     3,191$     2,955 1Excludes net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net and tax provision adjustments.

The move also comes one day after payments giant PayPal (PYPL) announced plans to issue a stablecoin in the coming days.Bitcoin (BTC) rose just shy of 3% over the past 24 hours to $30,068 leading the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) to a 2.9% advance. It's bitcoin's first foray above $30,000 since a very brief move above that level on Aug. 3. Other movers of note Tuesday include solana (SOL), toncoin (TON) and chainlink (LINK), all sporting gains of more 5%.China overnight reported a 12.4% year-over-year decline in imports in July, more than double the drop forecast by economists. Exports fell 14.5%, worse than estimates for a 12.4% drop. Declines at those levels haven't been seen since the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the news suggests Beijing may have to take additional steps to stimulate China's economy.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is lower by 11 basis points to 3.98%. At one point last week, the 10-year was at a 2023 high just shy of 4.20%. Yields on long-dated government bonds across Europe are posting even steeper declines on Tuesday, including in Germany, where the 10-year Bund yield is down 15.4 basis points to 2.445%.In other economic news, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in a speech that barring ""alarming"" new data, he's fine with the central bank not hiking rates any further. He added, though, that the idea of considering rate cuts is a long way off.Don't sleep on PayPal's stablecoin newsSome market watchers remained upbeat about the longer-term growth of crypto markets despite the generally muted response to news Monday that PayPal is introducing its own stablecoin (PYUSD), marking the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin.Users will be able to transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.Story continues“PayPal USD (PYUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued in collaboration with Paxos Trust Co., is a significant development in the digital finance landscape,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE, said in a Telegram message. “Signifying the growing convergence between traditional financial systems and the world of crypto, this news is definitely bullish for the crypto market.“If the regulators do welcome this with open arms, we might see more U.S. fintech and payment companies proactively exploring digital currencies, and may even make a concerted shift toward new launches,” Mei said, adding successful launches may help instill confidence in the concept of stablecoins, especially following “last year’s setback Terra USD.""Hedera Hashgraph's HBAR Leads GainsHBAR, the native token of the Hedera Network, which claims to be the only public distributed ledger network suited for the security and stability requirements of big businesses, has seen its price shoot up over 10% over the past 24 hours, outpacing all other cryptocurrency gains on Tuesday.Hedera's social activity has soared with 30.68 million engagements over the past week, which is a 240% increase from the previous week, according to data from LunarCrush, a social intelligence platform.

Could this be a catalyst to ignite the next rally in Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry?From PayPal’s Newsroom Release:PayPal USD is designed to contribute to the opportunity stablecoins offer for payments and is 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD is redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is issued by Paxos Trust Company.Starting today and rolling out in the coming weeks, eligible U.S. PayPal customers who purchase PayPal USD will be able to:Transfer PayPal USD between PayPal and compatible external walletsSend person-to-person payments using PYUSDFund purchases with PayPal USD by selecting it at checkoutConvert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PayPal USDPayPal Crypto EffortsThis is a continuation of PayPal’s current strategy of entering the crypto markets. In late 2020 PYPL began offering customers the ability to buy a handful of the largest crypto currencies through its platform so offering a stablecoin is a logical next step in building out the ecosystem.Creating a stablecoin in the current economic environment is also one of the least risky, and most profitable ways to expand its crypto products. Stablecoins stand out as a highly profitable vertical within the cryptocurrency realm, particularly in a context of higher interest rates. This is especially true considering that stablecoin reserve portfolios typically comprise Treasuries, which have the potential to generate returns exceeding 5%.What's a Stablecoin?A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a tangible asset like a fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, Euro) or a commodity (e.g., gold). Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price volatility, stablecoins aim to provide a more consistent and reliable value. They are often used in digital transactions, trading, and as a store of value due to their relatively steady price characteristics.Story continuesPayPal Trading at a DiscountReflecting a mixed earnings revisions trend, PayPal currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. However, the stock is trading near its all-time low valuation. Today, PYPL is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is below the industry average of 47x, and well below its 10-year median of 43.2x.While P/E ratios are hardly a market timing tool, it is certainly worth noting just how cheaply PayPal is trading from a historical perspective.Other PlayersBitcoin and other crypto adjacent stocks have enjoyed strong YTD returns, even with the SEC cracking down on some of the biggest players.Coinbase, the publicly traded cryptocurrency brokerage, was recently sued by the SEC. The SEC alleges that Coinbase has been running an unregistered broker and clearing house, putting into question the entire business model. Yet COIN stock has rallied 140% YTD, nonetheless.While Coinbase may still appear too risky an investment considering its current legal troubles, and PayPal has a subpar Zacks Rank, there is one stock investors may want to consider.Block, Jack Dorsey’s fintech company is a top ranked stock with exposure to Bitcoin. Block has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions and is expected to roll out a new crypto product this year.Block is planning to release Bitkey, a hardware-based crypto key that will function as a self-custody wallet. Jack Dorsey is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin and regularly speaks on his support of blockchain technology and Bitcoin as an important economic tool.Bullish Setup in BitcoinBitcoin, along with the crypto stocks and broader market has been on a strong run this year already up 72% YTD.From a technical perspective, if Bitcoin can breakout above the $29,600 level it may begin the next bull leg higher. Alternatively, if it can’t hold the $28,500 level, Bitcoin traders should be cautious as the technical setup will be invalidated.Investors looking to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying the crypto may want to consider BITO by ProShares. BITO is a Bitcoin linked ETF that is constructed using Bitcoin futures rather than spot Bitcoin. BITO is currently the best option for access through the equity market.Bottom LinePayPal expanding its offerings is another positive step in the right direction for the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the original digital payment innovators, PayPal makes for a sensible medium for those looking to enter crypto.While I don’t know for certain how Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market will respond to this news, I consider it quite bullish, and wouldn’t be surprised if it acted as a catalyst for a rally.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""The top absolute detractors were Illumina, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). PayPal was also weak in the quarter, but we have become more optimistic about the company’s growth prospects. We recently doubled our position in PayPal to bring it up from a small to an average-sized position for us. We have been patient with PayPal while the company is changing its CEO and trying to modernize its technology architecture to accelerate product development. At a recent investor meeting, the company’s new Chief Product Officer, John Kim, demonstrated that PayPal, Venmo, and Braintree are now all finally on one modern tech stack that is integrated and flexible. This demonstrated to us that a new, one-touch buying experience across all of PayPal’s merchants should finally be within reach and should put PayPal back at parity with its innovative peers regarding web and mobile checkout functionality and user experience.This means PayPal’s competitive position should be improving just as the growth rate of e-commerce is set to accelerate, likely leading to double-digit revenue growth again in 2024 and beyond. While we continue to monitor PayPal’s ongoing CEO search, the company’s technology and product development are now on much better footing in our view, e-commerce growth is set to accelerate, and we believe the valuation is surprisingly low at approximately 13x next-twelve-month EPS.As a reminder, PayPal is still by far the most prominent digital wallet in the world, with over 400 million users, 190 million monthly active users, and 35 million merchant customers. In their digital vault, PayPal also has nearly one in four credit and debit cards issued globally (outside of China). This unmatched size and scale, now on a modern, flexible technology foundation, positions PayPal well for the future of digital payments in our view.""Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

The majority of these have been floated on Ethereum, where the original PYUSD exists.New York-based payments giant PayPal said on Monday that it will soon make its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin available to users, marking the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin.Users can transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.While the tokens are yet to come, some scammers are already trying to trap unsuspecting users. The modus operandi is to issue a token, name it “PYUSD,” add liquidity with ether or another token and offer it to users on a decentralized exchange.This is possible as anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.Most of the supply of these tokens are likely purchased by their creators after issuance, giving the illusion of a trendy token while being a honeypot in reality. The hustle may yield a few thousand dollars in a few hours for such developers – making it a profitable, albeit wholly unethical, venture.Some developers may, however, pull all liquidity from the fake tokens hours after issuance, causing prices to drop 100% and leaving speculators holding digital dust.]"

197,59a4d9c1-6d03-3892-845e-b37ffaed9ec8,IBM,2023-08-08,How AI Is Helping Companies Meet Sustainability Goals,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-helping-companies-meet-sustainability-124500434.html,1691412300,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 7, 2023 / IBMIBM, Monday, August 7, 2023, Press release pictureAI tools like ChatGPT are grabbing headlines, but other AI techniques and tools specifically designed for enterprises are quietly helping companies meet their sustainability goals. Classic AI is already being used widely today in various use cases, and generative AI is evolving rapidly to address new classes of use cases.I previously led technical teams that helped customers with their AI implementations. When I started a role as a leader for sustainability in Expert Labs, our professional technology services organization, I saw the potential for AI to help with energy efficiency, decarbonization, and waste reduction. Discover the current and emerging use cases for AI in waste management, optimization, energy reduction and ESG reporting.Learn more about AI-powered sustainability solutions here.How AI is helping businesses accelerate their sustainability journey todayAsset management: Whether it's for utility infrastructure or factory floor machinery, timely intervention can prolong the life of an asset; reducing the volume of waste sent to landfill and the environmental impact of creating a replacement. AI solutions work by collecting asset performance data and feeding it into machine learning models, which can predict asset health and risk of failure.Inventory management: Transportation uses energy;in addition, perishable goods may need to be refrigerated in transit and storage. Inventory optimization is important to ensure you have enough stock while also meeting customer demand. At the same time, you want to reduce the carbon footprint associated with moving and storing stock. AI helps address this problem by combining aspects like demand forecasting, last-mile delivery, and routing optimization.Schedule optimization: This use case is like inventory management but addresses the challenge of ensuring that you have the appropriate alignment of talent. If we think about asset maintenance, for example, the questions are which technicians are available, where, and how should their work be prioritized. It's not about minimizing travel. Instead, it's better to prioritize a more distant asset for repair because that asset has a higher cost or could fail sooner. AI can tackle problems like asset maintenance efficiently.Anomaly detection: Some manufacturers have zero-defect goals. If a part is defective or assembled incorrectly, it might not be possible to salvage or recycle it. Image and video recognition systems can use AI to monitor each stage of manufacture, catching any discrepancies as early as possible. As well as wasted materials, additional energy is consumed when parts have to be reworked or remade. This use case shows how AI can help by processing unstructured image and video data in addition to structured data in the previous examples.Compute optimization: Data centers consume a huge amount of electricity.By using AI to understand compute demand over time, it becomes possible to optimize the use of computing and cooling resources. Matching resources to demand more closely helps to save energy.Story continuesWhere to next?Over the next year or so, I expect to see companies deploying generative AI applications that help with a new class of use cases to meet their sustainability goals. Some companies are already working on them.The first among these is using intelligent document understanding to process sustainability information. Companies use several different frameworks to report their environmental impact in a standardized way. It's a time-consuming process to collect relevant information and produce ESG reports. Generative AI software retrieves and summarizes text information from various business systems, including supplier systems, and maps it to the reporting frameworks, with the option for human review.On the other side, AI streamlines processing information already compiled in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) reports. A company could combine purchase order information with a supplier's ESG report. For example, if you know you're responsible for half of a supplier's turnover you can use their ESG reports to estimate your responsibility for scope 3 emissions.For investors interested in green finance, AI could process ESG reports in bulk to create a recommended shortlist of companies with a stronger environmental posture. In an advanced use case, generative AI models fine-tuned with a company's sustainability policies could power an advisor application for activities such as supplier selection.Foundation large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned with domain-specific data, are likely to play an important role in intelligent text processing applications like these.Foundation models using geospatial data are also likely to make their mark in the coming year or so. These models will be valuable for predicting flood zones, forest fires, and other climate risks. Businesses in sectors including agriculture, retail, utilities, and financial services will be able to use these models for risk assessment and mitigation.As companies adopt generative AI in these new use cases, they also need to pay attention to a new set of risks that are emerging, ranging from potential privacy concerns to a lack of factuality. A Responsible AI approach and an AI Governance framework are both needed to ensure guardrails are in place for the responsible use of both Classic and generative AI.Sustainability goals and other business goals go hand in hand. For many of these use cases, there is a close relationship between sustainability and cost. Reducing energy, avoiding waste, and optimizing resources have financial benefits as well as environmental advantages. Using new sustainability applications powered by AI, companies will find it easier to make decisions that are aligned with their sustainability goals.Read the power of AI: SustainabilityView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/772602/How-AI-Is-Helping-Companies-Meet-Sustainability-Goals]"

The company has been focused on portfolio diversification and fueling growth with Key Customers. This resolute approach has proved invaluable in navigating volatile market conditions.Let’s IntrospectPilgrim's Pride's success is attributed to its customer-centric approach and strategic initiatives, which aim to provide competitive advantages. The U.K. and Europe business is set to maintain the company’s impressive margin growth trajectory, driven by the advantages stemming from an ongoing manufacturing network optimization program, strong growth with Key Customers, and synergies from back-office integration.

(NASDAQ:UAL). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on United Airlines Holdings’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings Is United Airlines Holdings Still Cheap?Good news, investors! United Airlines Holdings is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $74.75, but it is currently trading at US$53.68 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because United Airlines Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from United Airlines Holdings?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. United Airlines Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 74%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UAL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UAL.

But despite rising interest rates and credit card debt, Americans are still spending.David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, said he saw ""encouraging"" signs in Amazon's results. North American retail operations were responsible for more than two thirds of Amazon's $4.4 billion improvement in operating income, noted Klink, whose firm holds stakes valued at about $166 million in Amazon shares, $80 million in Walmart shares and $19 million in Target shares.Yet a major question is ""whether Amazon's growth was more to do with improvements it has been making"" than a reflection of stronger consumer demand across the board, said GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.Amazon has been making efforts to speed up its same-day and one-day deliveries, introduce adjustments at its Whole Foods business such as lower prices and embedded checkout technology, as well as sharpen in-stock levels and refine the decor of its Amazon Fresh stores, executives and analysts said.The Seattle-based company forecast as much as a 13% rise in sales for the July-September period, driven by strong performance during its ""Prime Day"" event held on July 11 and 12. To be sure, Amazon's second-quarter numbers reflect higher prices and relatively low comparisons. In the same period last year, U.S. inflation was at its peak, prompting shoppers to cut back on purchases.Story continuesTarget, which reports April-June results on Aug. 16, in May forecast a grim second quarter and said it expects full-year comparable sales to either rise or fall by low-single digits. Walmart, which reports on Aug. 17, had a better-than-expected first quarter and forecast sales to be up about 3.5% for the year. But Walmart executives said they were ""uncertain"" about the back half of 2023, as goods become more expensive and people have less money to spend.Other big companies have also signaled possible choppy waters ahead. Apple, shipping group Maersk and advertising giant WPP said last week they expect less demand for iPhone shipments, global container volume and advertising spend respectively over the next few months.Amazon's performance following its Prime Day was a ""good read for discount retailers,"" however, said Joseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group.""I think that value-based retailers like Walmart and Target"" will hold up better than others, he said.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)]"

This compares to earnings of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 73.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chip products maker would post a loss of $0.25 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.24, delivering a surprise of 4%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Magnachip , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $60.98 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $101.38 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Magnachip shares have lost about 1.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 16.6%.What's Next for Magnachip?While Magnachip has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Magnachip: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

216,e0e709bc-eb42-3850-8951-0145391db592,KLAC,2023-08-08,KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) Has Announced A Dividend Of $1.30,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-nasdaq-klac-announced-dividend-100138739.html,1691488898,STORY,['KLAC'],"[KLA Corporation's (NASDAQ:KLAC) investors are due to receive a payment of $1.30 per share on 1st of September. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 1.0%.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that KLA's stock price has increased by 35% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. Check out our latest analysis for KLA KLA's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Before making this announcement, KLA was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 26.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendKLA Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.60 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $5.20. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. KLA has impressed us by growing EPS at 37% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Story continuesKLA Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for KLA that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

In addition, we made significant progress in our plans to reduce exposure to alternative assets and further bolstered what was already a solid balance sheet.""Aimco’s operating apartment communities continue to experience high demand and broadly benefit from their ‘B’ price point and locations within mature submarkets that face limited competitive new supply. During the first half of the year, our stabilized portfolio delivered NOI growth of 11.4% and we have increased our projection for year-over-year NOI growth by 225 basis points at the midpoint.""Our active development projects remain on time, on budget, and are projected to produce more than $55 million of NOI annually upon stabilization, with more than half of that income expected to be online within the next 12 months. Planning and entitlement investment in Aimco's pipeline assets are adding value as we prepare sites for future development but maintain the optionality to monetize those assets at various points in the process, as needed to maximize our risk adjusted returns.""Furthering our efforts to simplify the Aimco business and prudently allocate capital, we reduced our allocation to alternative investments during the quarter by closing on a partial sale of our Parkmerced mezzanine loan. Together with the unwinding our related interest rate swaption, we monetized $92 million and have a path to realize an additional $156 million under the terms of our agreement with the loan’s purchaser.Story continues""Also during the quarter, we proactively retired $60 million of higher-cost floating rate debt. Our balance sheet benefits from ample liquidity and attractive in place financing with minimal near-term maturities.""The Aimco board and management team remain committed to maximizing and unlocking value for Aimco shareholders. Year to date, through July 31, we acquired more than 3.1 million shares of Aimco common stock at an average price of $7.54 per share and have authorization to purchase an additional nine million shares.""I am thankful to work with a committed team whose relentless focus and hard work continues to result in solid performance for Aimco.""Financial Results and Recent HighlightsNet loss attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was $(0.02) for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to net income per share of $1.57 for the same period in 2022, due primarily to the second quarter 2022 recognition of income resulting from the agreement to terminate the leased property agreements with AIR Communities and gains in the same period related to the sale of an apartment community.Second Quarter 2023 revenue, expenses, and NOI from Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties were up 9.5%, 8.8%, and 9.8%, respectively, year-over-year, with average monthly revenue per apartment home of $2,291, up $230 year-over-year and an average rent to income of 19.2% for new Aimco residents, down 100 basis points year-over-year.Aimco updated full year 2023 guidance for revenue, expense, and NOI from Aimco's Stabilized Operating Properties, raising the revenue outlook after completing more than 80% of our lease transactions for the year at favorable rates, and raising the expense outlook primarily due to higher real estate taxes following a substantial increase in the assessed value of Yacht Club at Brickell, located in Miami, Florida, as well as higher than anticipated insurance cost increases following our policy renewal earlier this year. The net impact is an increase in our 2023 NOI growth of 225 bps at the midpoint as compared to prior guidance.Full Year 2023 Year-Over-Year Growth RatesStabilized Operating PropertiesRevised Guidance RangePrior Guidance RangeLowHighLowHighRevenue, before utility reimbursements7.75%-8.75%5.00%-7.00%Expenses, net of utility reimbursements8.00%-9.00%5.25%-7.25%Net operating income (NOI)7.50%-9.00%5.00%-7.00%In June, Aimco closed on the partial sale of the Parkmerced mezzanine loan, making significant progress on its planned reduction of capital allocated to alternative investments. In total, Aimco has monetized $91.5 million of its Parkmerced investments and, subject to closing the remaining investment, may realize additional proceeds of approximately $156 million.In June, Aimco repaid a $60 million floating interest rate land loan at par, reducing the weighted average cost of debt for Aimco's developments and land holdings, at the time of payoff, by approximately 90 basis points.Aimco acquired 1.0 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter 2023 at an average cost of $7.97 per share. Year to date, as of July 31, 2023, Aimco acquired more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $7.54 per share.As of July 31, 2023, total shareholder return (""TSR"") since the December 15, 2020 spin-off of AIR Communities was 52.6% and year-to-date was 17.0%.Value Add, Opportunistic &amp; Alternative InvestmentsDevelopment and RedevelopmentAimco generally seeks development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and Aimco has a comparative advantage over others in the market. Aimco’s value add and opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.As of June 30, 2023, Aimco had five active development and redevelopment projects located in four U.S. markets, in varying phases of construction and lease-up. These projects remain on track, as measured by construction budget and lease-up metrics. Additionally, Aimco has a pipeline of future value-add opportunities totaling approximately 14 million gross square feet of development in Aimco's target markets of Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro, and Colorado's Front Range. During the second quarter, Aimco invested $81.1 million in development and redevelopment activities. Updates include:In Miami, Florida, construction and repositioning of The Hamilton is now complete. Demand for rental housing in Southeast Florida remains robust, especially for unique waterfront properties, such as The Hamilton. As of July 31, 2023, 96% of the building's 276 units were leased or pre-leased at rates more than 20% ahead of underwritten rents. Aimco now expects occupancy to stabilize in the third quarter 2023, ahead of prior expectations.In Bethesda, Maryland, construction is progressing on plan at the first phase of Strathmore Square, which will contain 220 highly tailored apartment homes with initial delivery on track for the second half of 2024. This suburban infill project is located adjacent to the Grosvenor-Strathmore Metro station and the Strathmore Performing Arts Campus, and is 1.5 miles from The National Institutes of Health main campus. Funding for the $164.0 million project is fully secured with Aimco having already funded 100% of its equity commitment.In upper northwest Washington D.C., construction at Upton Place continues on schedule and on budget. Aimco began pre-leasing efforts for Upton’s 689 apartment homes in July 2023 in anticipation of initial delivery in the fourth quarter of 2023. To date, 80% of the project's 105K square feet of retail space has been leased and Aimco has received letters of intent from, or is in lease negotiations with, retailers on another 18%.In Corte Madera, California, construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single family rental homes and eight accessory dwelling units are being developed. Aimco expects to deliver the first homes in the third quarter 2023 with pre-leasing efforts underway.In Aurora, Colorado, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club, a 106-key boutique hotel and event center with 18K square feet of event space, is complete and open to guests. As the only ‘on campus’ accommodations, The Benson is garnering strong interest from the many departments and offices located on the surrounding Anschutz Medical Campus, which includes The University of Colorado Medical School, UC Health Hospital, Children’s Hospital Colorado, The Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center and the burgeoning Fitzsimons Innovation Community.In the second quarter 2023, Aimco invested $5.6 million into future development pipeline projects located in Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro, and Colorado’s Front Range. Programming, design, documentation and entitlement efforts continue. As part of Aimco's capital allocation strategy, it may choose to monetize certain pipeline assets prior to vertical construction in an effort to maximize value add and risk adjusted returns.Alternative InvestmentsAimco’s current alternative investments are primarily those investments originated prior to the separation from AIR Communities and include a mezzanine loan secured by a stabilized multifamily property with an option to participate in future multifamily development, as well as three passive equity investments. Over time, we plan to significantly reduce capital allocated to these investments. Updates include:In June, Aimco made significant progress on its plan to reduce capital allocated to alternative investments through the partial sale of the Parkmerced mezzanine loan. Aimco closed a 20% non-controlling position for $33.5 million with the purchaser having the option to acquire the remaining 80% for an additional $134 million plus interest accruing at no less than 19% annually through May 2024. At the time of closing, the purchaser pre-paid $4 million of interest to Aimco and is expected to pay another $7 million prior to year end.Investment ActivityAimco is focused on growing the business, and delivering strong investment returns, through development and redevelopment activities, funded primarily through third-party capital.In the second quarter, no new investments were made.Operating Property ResultsAimco owns a diversified portfolio of operating apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages.Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties produced solid results for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.Second QuarterYear-to-DateStabilized Operating PropertiesYear-over-YearSequentialYear-over-Year($ in millions)20232022Variance1Q 2023Variance20232022VarianceAverage Daily Occupancy96.2%97.6%(1.4)%98.0%(1.8)%97.1%98.1%(1.0)%Revenue, before utility reimbursements$37.0$33.89.5%$36.70.9%$73.7$66.710.4%Expenses, net of utility reimbursements11.510.68.8%11.22.8%22.721.08.2%Net operating income (NOI)25.523.29.8%25.50.1%51.045.811.4%Revenue in the second quarter 2023 was $37.0 million, up 9.5% year-over-year, resulting from a $230 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to $2,291, partially offset by a 140-basis point decrease in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.2%.New lease rents increased 8.2% and Aimco retained 60.8% of residents whose leases were expiring during the quarter at rents 12.5% higher, on average, than the previous lease.The median annual household income of new residents was $140,000 in the second quarter 2023, up more than 20% from the same period in 2022, representing a rent to income ratio of 19.2%.Expenses in the second quarter 2023 were up 8.8% year over year due primarily to higher real estate taxes and insurance.Net operating income in the second quarter 2023 was $25.5 million, up 9.8% year-over-year.Other Real Estate OperationsAimco also owns 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, a waterfront office building in Miami, Florida, owned as part of a larger assemblage with substantial development potential. Leases within the building have been executed on terms of less than four years or contain redevelopment provisions as needed to maximize the value of the underlying development rights.Demand for vacant space at our office building in Miami has remained active with tours and inquiries continuing at a steady pace. Following first quarter lease expirations, as of June 30, 2023, the building was 77% occupied, and by the end of July, the building was 79% leased.Balance Sheet and Financing ActivityAimco is highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including having at all times ample liquidity. As of June 30, 2023, Aimco had access to $339.2 million, including $163.3 million of cash on hand, $25.9 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on its revolving credit facility.Aimco’s net leverage as of June 30, 2023, was as follows:as of June 30, 2023Proportionate, $ in thousandsAmountWeighted Avg.Maturity (Yrs.)

The contractual floating interest rate at the time of payoff was 11.875% with an effective rate after consideration of an in-place rate cap of 11.1%. The associated rate cap was also monetized, producing proceeds of $0.6 million. At the time of payoff, the weighted average cost of debt for Aimco's developments and land holdings was reduced by approximately 90 basis points.Public Market EquityCommon Stock RepurchasesIn the second quarter, Aimco repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $7.97 per share. In 2023, through July 31, Aimco repurchased more than 3.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of approximately $7.54 per share.Commitment to Enhance Stockholder ValueThe Aimco Board of Directors, in coordination with management, continues its review of a broad range of options to further enhance and unlock value for Aimco stockholders. During the ongoing review, Aimco has engaged with, and will continue to solicit input from, several leading advisory firms, including Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. serving as the Company’s financial advisor.Aimco is well positioned for long term growth as a result of its high-quality development pipeline and investment platform, diversified portfolio of core and opportunistic multifamily assets, and long-duration, low-cost, balance sheet.As such, the timing of any actions that may result from the Board’s review will take into consideration a host of factors, including the health and stability of both the financial and capital markets as well as the continued advancement of Aimco’s previously defined strategic plan.There can be no assurance that the ongoing review will result in any particular transaction or transactions or other strategic changes or outcomes and the timing of any such event is similarly uncertain. The Company does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to the foregoing unless or until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required.2023 Outlook2023 Outlook$ in millions (except per share amounts), Square Feet in millionsSecond Quarter2023 YTD2023 Full YearForecastPrior Full YearForecastNet income (loss) per share – diluted$(0.09)$(0.28) - $(0.18)$(0.33) - $(0.23)Active Developments and RedevelopmentsTotal Direct Costs of Projects Underway [1]$815$773$815Direct Project Costs$105.2$175 - $185$165 - $185Other Capitalized Costs$17.1$36 - $38$30 - $31Construction Loan Draws$75.7$170 - $175$150 - $170JV Partner Equity Funding$0.2$0.4$0AIV Equity Funding$46.5~$50~$45Pipeline ProjectsPipeline Size Gross Square Feet [2]14.114.114.0Pipeline Size Multifamily Units [2]6,5446,5446,544Pipeline Size Commercial Sq Ft [2]1.71.71.7Planning Costs$11.3$20 - $25$20 - $25Real Estate TransactionsAcquisitionsNoneNoneNoneDispositions [3]$91.5$98.5$220Operating PropertiesRevenue Growth, before utility reimbursements [4]10.4%7.75% - 8.75%5.0% - 7.0%Operating Expense Growth, net of utility reimbursements [4]8.2%8.0% - 9.0%5.25% - 7.25%Net Operating Income Growth [4]11.4%7.5% - 9.0%5.0% - 7.0%Recurring Capital Expenditures$3.7$11 - $13$11 - $13General and Administrative$16.3$33 - $34$33 - $35LeverageInterest Expense, net of capitalization [5]$14.2$33 - $35$38 - $41[1] Includes land or leasehold value, calculated as the quarterly average and is reduced from prior guidance due to the accelerated stabilization of The Hamilton in 3Q 2023 and its corresponding removal from projects underway in 4Q 2023.[2] Includes pipeline projects as presented on Supplemental Schedule 5b, calculated as the quarterly average.[3] Dispositions include the gross proceeds from the partial sale of the Parkmerced mezzanine investment and the monetization of the related swaption.

The net impact is an increase in our 2023 NOI growth of 225 bps at the midpoint as compared to prior guidance.[5] Includes contractual interest expense, exclusive of the amortization of deferred financing costs, and reduced by interest rate option payments which are included in the Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate options line on Aimco's income statement.Supplemental InformationThe full text of this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information referenced in this release are available on Aimco’s website at investors.aimco.com.Glossary &amp; Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresFinancial and operating measures found in this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are measures not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

The SoftBank-owned firm will officially apply to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the listing later this month, the newspaper said.Arm plans to sell the chipmakers stakes of ""a few percent each"", the newspaper said.SoftBank declined to comment. Apple and Intel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, while Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment.The long-awaited IPO is seen as a potential windfall for Softbank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son's sprawling tech conglomerate.SoftBank has been targeting a listing for Arm since its deal to sell the chip designer to Nvidia collapsed last year due to objections from antitrust regulators.The planned U.S. listing could raise between $8 billion and $10 billion, sources told Reuters in April. At an earnings briefing on Tuesday, SoftBank's chief financial officer provided no details on a listing date or fundraising goal, but said preparations were going ""very smoothly"".SoftBank posted a surprise loss on Tuesday but said it was dipping its toes back into new investments after its Vision Fund unit returned to the black for the first time in six quarters.

NVIDIA supplies GPUs (graphics processing units), the preferred (often necessary) semiconductors for machine learning and AI. On their recent earnings call, NVIDIA management announced that they expect a significant increase in demand for the GPUs for datacenter customers beginning this quarter and lasting at least through the end of this year. NVIDIA’s datacenter business, which was almost non-existent from a revenue perspective eight years ago, is now the company’s largest and fastest-growing business.We find NVIDIA’s competitive advantages to be quite large around its technology, but even more importantly around its full-stack solutions, including highly integrated hardware, software, and networking equipment and a robust developer ecosystem. It would be difficult to disrupt these competitive advantages in our view.

Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon.Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.Video Transcript- Well, as the earnings season approached, many cast a wary eye on tech. The sector's been propping up the market. And given the unstable economic environment, investors have been using it to judge the health of the economy. And the majority of the so-called Magnificent Seven have all been able to beat Wall Street expectations. All have done well this earnings season.So let's bring in Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan to discuss more. Good to have you on the show, Daniel.DANIEL MORGAN: Hi, Rachelle.- So give us this breakdown of-- good to see you-- of how tech has been faring. Because obviously this initial rally started with tech. But where are we now when we factor in the earnings season?DANIEL MORGAN: What's interesting, Rachelle, as you mentioned in the beginning of the conversation, the bar for the tech sector coming into this second quarter was really low. But I will have to say that I was very pleased with the way that a lot of these earnings reports go. I mean, if we just kind of kick off and we look at online ad spend rates with Meta and Google a couple of weeks ago, the expectations were they would be flat to negative. And both those companies reported an increase in revenue. So Meta was up 11%, Google was up about 3.5% in their ad revenues.Story continuesAnd that kind of worked itself through the reports. Amazon kind of capped things off with a very good report with revenues up 11%. And then we had Apple, which was kind of a mixed review. We knew that smartphone unit volumes were going to be very muted going into the second quarter. But overall, their guidance that they gave for the upcoming third quarter was very strong in regards to services and iPhones.So I think overall, we'd have to take-- a takeaway from this, Rachelle, that is that numbers came in better than expected. We had a very low bar. Can we make up for these huge runs that we've had in these stocks, though? Right, Rachelle, coming into these reports. And I think that's where investors are pondering right now.- And of these Magnificent Seven, who was the most underwhelming for you? Especially when you factored in some of the guidance and the softness that we saw.DANIEL MORGAN: Microsoft was somewhat muted. Apple was somewhat muted. Those would be the two that kind of stood out at least at this point, to me, that were good numbers. They weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create like a catalyst or surprise, like we saw with Google, Meta, and let's say Amazon. So those two kind of stick in my mind.- And as we look at, of course, the chip space, NVIDIA riding high and enjoying those gains on that generative AI push that kept popping up in everybody's earnings call. But what about some of the other chipmakers? Who are you following there? And any surprises there?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, there's other stocks in that group, Rachelle, that could turn out to take some sort of not leadership role, but market share in the AI space. If you look at-- just to name a few, Marvel Technologies has their DSP chip called PAM, which is somewhat exciting. You have Broadcom, which has their Jericho3 chip. Now these are all chips that are just being rolled out that are in that same space that can compete directly against NVIDIA.We also know that Intel has their Falcon Shores chip that's going to come out next year. AMD, which reported last week, has their MI300, which is a AI chip that's being promoted as something that's going to compete directly against NVIDIA. So there are other companies in that space. We're going to be rolling into NVIDIA, Rachelle. About two weeks from now, we're going to get numbers from then mid week.But those are some of the reports that have kind of rolled in. Qualcomm has their AI 100 they reported last week also. So but that's still in an infancy stage. Rachelle, as we know, we haven't had a lot of tangible evidence that AI has actually directly impacted the financials of these companies. NVIDIA's really the only company that's actually shown tangible evidence of strength in terms of their AI chips.- And of course, a lot of these markets, these big tech names, also have a lot of exposure to China as well. And we're seeing some softness there in terms of demand. What are some of the stories that you're looking at coming out of China that you think we should be really keeping an eye on when it comes to big tech and where valuations then go from here?DANIEL MORGAN: You're right, Rachelle. I mean, Qualcomm gets about 60% of their revenues coming out of China. And China's head of the double sword, right? You have not only the impacts of them coming off of COVID lockdowns and how overall demand for, let's say, smartphones are coming. We know that when Apple reported numbers last week, their overall demand for smartphones in China was actually much stronger than people considered. It was actually positive where people thought it was negative.And then you also have this issue with regulators in terms of these back and forth of China no longer allowing certain chips that are produced by US companies to come into their country and vice versa. So China has got a lot of moving parts not only from the overall growth of their economy and demand for different electronics, but also in terms of what's going to happen from a regulatory perspective. How is that going to impact various companies?We already know there was news out a couple weeks ago about Micron. We know that NVIDIA-- those are companies that China has isolated as being not allowed to bring chips into their country, various chips that they make. So a lot of things coming out of China, a lot of things to follow.- And in terms of companies that you're going to be keeping an eye on as we continue through the thick of the earnings season, what are some of the bellwether stocks that are going to give us a better idea of how the consumer is feeling and how looking at things like business CapEx and what-- how companies are choosing to invest based on this macroeconomic environment?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, Rachelle, we have Cisco next week. So that's going to give us a good idea of what's going on in terms of CapEx, in terms of networking. The following week, we have Snowflake, we have NVIDIA. So those are some big numbers that are going to be coming out. Snowflake, as you know, is a middleware company and the data center space. They make the tools and software that allow you to pull data off of the big data centers.Obviously, NVIDIA, which we've already talked about in terms of AI. We also have Applied Materials reporting next week. They'll give us a good idea of how CapEx budgets are going in terms of companies spending on semiconductor equipment. And that gives us an idea of what the demand is in that space.So we still have a lot of big numbers coming out here. We also have Salesforce, which is a big play on the software as a service in terms of the enterprise. So we have more to go than just the so-called FAANG stocks or Magnificent Seven that have mostly reported up at this point. So we'll obviously be checking in here over the next couple of weeks on those numbers.- We appreciate you getting us up to speed on all of that and for joining us with your insights.DANIEL MORGAN: Thank you, Rachelle.- Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan. Good to see you.]"

stockholders excluding net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net, and tax provision adjustments (""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted EPS"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management, investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Three Months EndedJune 30, 2023June 30, 2022IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$         369$         308Less: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests6(2)Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders$         375$       0.74$         306$       0.55Impairment and restructuring charges990.20——Other, net5(10)(0.02)1350.24Tax provision(21)(0.04)(28)(0.05)As adjusted$         443$       0.88$         413$       0.74The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Twelve Months EndedJune 30, 2023June 30, 2022IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$     1,253$     1,233Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(14)(28)Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders$     1,239$       2.33$     1,205$       2.11Impairment and restructuring charges1110.21——Other, net67031.325130.90Tax provision(187)(0.35)(127)(0.22)As adjusted$     1,866$       3.51$     1,591$       2.79NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2023:Three Months Ended June 30,Twelve Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022$ MillionsNet Income$         369$         308$     1,253$     1,233Add:Amortization of cable distribution investments441618Depreciation and amortization10399411363Impairment and restructuring charges99—111—Interest expense, net3586218371Other, net7(11)134699509Income tax expense136139483461Adjusted EBITDA$         735$         770$     3,191$     2,955 1Excludes net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net and tax provision adjustments.

But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders, since the share price is down 33% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 35%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 20% in a year. Furthermore, it's down 15% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Walt Disney saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 5.4% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 12% annual reduction in the share price. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Walt Disney has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Walt Disney had a tough year, with a total loss of 20%, against a market gain of about 9.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Story continuesOf course Walt Disney may not be the best stock to buy.

Investors will be eyeing the performance of Disney's theme parks, prospective broadcast partnerships for ESPN, and CEO Bob Iger's plans for the future of the company.Former Disney EVP Lee Cockerell sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to detail the impact Iger's leadership has on the company, explaining that his management style allows executives to ""make decisions instead of being held back."" Cockerell notes many employees have been excited about Iger's return stating ""he creates the right culture, and people like him."" Cockerell also believes Disney's rivalry with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is likely to just ""fade off.""Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Disney reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Investors will be keeping an eye on the parks and experiences business. There's growing concern about demand amid high inflationary cost pressures along with the future of the streaming business and plans to take ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer service. For more on this, we turn to Lee Cockerell. Lee is a former executive Vice President of Operations for the Walt Disney World Resort. And still with us is Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, which is her wheelhouse as well.So Lee, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start big picture. Let's start with Iger and Bob Iger with his return and what he's doing. I mean, he's made a lot of cost cuts and tried to, you know, streamline Disney. What's your take on where Iger is with righting the ship, if you will?LEE COCKERRELL: Well, Iger was there when I was there. And then I've been retired for some time. And I heard a lot of things when Chapek was there. And I learned a lot of cheering when Bob came back. And I-- you know, I live six miles from Disney World. And so I get a lot of feedback about how excited people are to have him back.And he's got a special way of working. He knows the customers and the employees. The cast members know everything you need to know. And I think he's opened up the allowing the park executives to make decisions instead of being held back. So it's pretty positive. And-- and so the same old story. He creates the right culture. And people like him. And they trust him. And he gets involved in a positive way. So it should be good.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: But Lee, what comes after Iger? Because we saw the board extend his contract by another two years. It was also interesting to see Tom Staggs, Kevin Mayer, former Disney employees, come back on as strategic advisors, for some of the problems that Disney is going through like trying to take ESPN fully over the top. What do you make of the leadership outlook moving forward for Disney? Because that has been a concern for investors.LEE COCKERRELL: Yeah. If we could guess what that's going to be, I would place the bets on it. But I don't know. I think, you know, maybe it's going to be one of the guys he's bringing back, or that's a big challenge at Disney. It always has been for years, because Michael Eisner and then Bob stayed there for long, many, many, many, many years and didn't turn over like a lot of executives do these days. They were steady and long term. And it's a different product.You know, Disney World is the only part of Disney and the parks that have real guests. The rest is all, you know, movies and retail. And it takes some talent to be able to do all of that and to lead that effort. Bob set a good example. But I don't know what the plan will be to get him replaced. I guess that's why he got extended again for another few years besides the two years he committed to. So I'm sure they're all busy trying to figure it out.DIANE KING HALL: And I want to ask you about the parks in particular, especially when you think of just the cost in general and pressures that some consumers have and, you know, what we're seeing with regard to consumer spending. And consumers have been spending on experiences. Is there any cause for concern about how much strength the parks will continue to have for Disney?LEE COCKERRELL: Yeah. I think the cost thing has always been an issue. Every year, it's an issue for the last 25 years. I think that's on every product from any company that raises prices, there's a lot of attention to it. And of course, Disney is especially in the spotlight when they have a price hike.But I don't think the price will be an issue. They'll feature packages. They'll find ways. They've just done a big annual pass holders program at in Orlando. And the results were unbelievable, the number of people came back out and bought their annual passes. They're changing a lot of the rules to simplify the experience for guests now that, I would say, that Josh D'Amaro and Jeff Varley who runs Disney World have the authority to do that.So you're going to see a lot of changes coming, I think, in January with eliminating this reservation system, the meal plans coming back, which saves families money, reservation requirements, all of those kinds of things. You're going to see a lot of things going back to the way they were before Mr. Chapek was in place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Lee, what about Bob Iger's current battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, do you think that's had any impact on park attendance? Last time you were with us, you said CEOs cannot ride the fence on political issues anymore. Do you still stand by that?LEE COCKERRELL: Well, I think it's tricky. I mean, how do you-- I think Disney is doing the right thing. And I think, you know, if you lose the culture and you lose the trust of your employees, it's a lot even more slippery, because what makes Disney World is the cast members. I mean, people will tell you out of the thousands of people we hear from every year at Disney World, they always talk about how great the cast is, the employees, how well they treat them, the empathy.So, yeah, as we know, many companies are going through this right now. It's a tightrope. And I don't think that the DeSantis issue is going to be a big one. I think that will fade off into the sunset. Every kid could-- you know, I go do a survey with children. I can't find any children don't want to go to Disney World. So it's always the parents are the problem. Parents are always complaining. The kids are happy as a lark. Kids are happy if they just go to the water fountain. So, yeah.So so far it's 100% kids want to go there. So we'll see how long this-- and you know, I hate to say it, but all the reports, there's a lot of people like to write bad things about things when things are not going well for a company. And so I would take all of this press with a grain of salt of it's not the end of the world. And Disney's about to come up next year to start celebrating their 100th anniversary. Well--LEE COCKERRELL: 100th year.DIANE KING HALL: That will indeed be big. And to your point about Disney, definitely the kids, because my son says his favorite vacation, well, it's a little bit of a tie but for different reasons. But his favorite-- his best vacation, he said, was last year, we went to California. We went to Disneyland. There you go. I did like it better than I expected, because I've been to Disney World once before. It was overwhelming for me as a parent. So, yes. Yeah.LEE COCKERRELL: Did you like seeing him be happy?DIANE KING HALL: I did. I love that. So yes. Would I go again? Yes. So we will have to leave it there, though. I appreciate your time. Love your Mickey in the background. Disney EVP Lee Cockrell, thank you so much. And of course, thanks to Alexandra Canal.]"

The company also announced private equity firm KKR (KKR) will be buying its Simon &amp; Schuster business for $1.62 billion in an all-cash deal. Parrot Analytics PR &amp; Communications Manager Wade Payson-Denney says the Simon &amp; Schuster deal is ""a sign of things to come"" as companies look to offload linear or ""old-school media arms."" On the company's streaming business, Payson-Denney says ""it's hard for us to see, really, how Paramount+ makes the jump to that top three streaming category that clearly Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery currently have a hold on.""Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Shares of Paramount trading higher, up about 7% after its earnings. The company beating on both the top and bottom line. Paramount also announcing investment management company, KKR, will purchase Simon and Schuster from Paramount for $1.6 billion.For more on this, we want to turn to Wade Payson-Denney. Wade is PR and communications manager for Parrot Analytics. So Wade, thank you so much for joining us. At first blush in terms of this or these latest results, what's your take on Paramount?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Oh, well, first, congrats to you on getting out of the 100 well done. But, yeah, this is, I would say kind of to be expected. We have seen Paramount Plus growing its market share with originals with platform had a really good quarter in terms of both of those metrics. So, you know, we often see that demand for original content is a leading indicator of subscriber growth.I think, you know, all of the media companies are going to report slightly better earnings this quarter, if anything, because they're not making new shows, you know, because of the strikes. And then as far as the KK-- as far as the Simon Schuster sale to KKR, I do think that's a sign of things to come. I do think more of these companies are going to be selling off, selling off, you know, linear, kind of like old school media arms to private equity as we move forward.Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: So do you think this is part of the great consolidation in streaming that people have been talking-- I've been talking about this for years, something that's probably coming down the pike? Or is this just part of a larger media reorganization cycle that just seems to happen every 10 to 20 years?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Maybe a bit of both. Look, I think I think Paramount Global, you know, what they've done with Paramount Plus, as far as effectively, you know, closing off Showtime, bringing all of that content onto Paramount Plus that that has helped with scale, I find it-- it's hard for us to see really how Paramount Plus makes the jump to that top three streaming category that clearly Netflix, Disney, and Warner Brothers Discovery currently have a hold on. You know, I think there's certainly an important player. They have really beloved franchises for, I mean, specifically, you know, ""Star Trek"" and Taylor Sheridan fans, like, they're not going to go anywhere else. And there's a lot of those.So that's a big plus for Paramount Plus. And yeah, you know, I think it does seem like-- yeah, as far as Paramount Global is concerned, you know, we saw reports of them trying to sell off BET earlier. I think if KKR is willing to, you know, actually make that acquisition, then I think some of the-- either them or one of their competitors might be willing to look at BET maybe, even CBS.Yeah. I think just based on the Simon and Schuster sale, I do think that that's not the last time we're going to see this kind of thing happen.DIANE KING HALL: So there has been talk before about them potentially selling off CBS. But could you see that really happening, given the sports piece of the business when you think about how lucrative sports is and especially given the NFL access that CBS has?WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: Yeah, no. I think I don't see it happening in the short term. I mean, you know, that CBS has the Super Bowl early next year at the conclusion of this season. And that's what like 7 million for 30-second ads. Yeah, they're not going to get rid of that anytime soon. So, yeah. And look, the NFL, that's really the-- I mean, the NFL owns linear TV, you know? If you look at last year of the 100 most viewed broadcasts, 82 were NFL games. That's up from 75 in 2021. And I do think that that's only going to grow, especially with the lack of, you know, scripted series that will be seeing at the beginning of the broadcast season next month.JARED BLIKRE: We got a little bit of time here for one more. I'll give you the floor. Anything you haven't talked about here that you think is important to talk about in the Paramount discussion.WADE PAYSON-DENNEY: I think that if you-- I think soccer's a big deal. I think if you look at not just, you know, obviously kids playing it, those numbers are always growing. But if you look at soccer and television and streaming, you know, Ted Lasso was a massive hit for Apple TV Plus. It really put Apple TV Plus on the map as far as like a home for Emmy-winning content.If you look at FX and Hulu with ""Welcome to Wrexham,"" the docuseries about Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's soccer club in Wales, that was a huge hit. Messi is just like taking over Apple TV Plus. Paramount Plus has the UEFA Champions League. That's, you know, probably the top. That's like the pinnacle of club soccer of-- club soccer competition worldwide. So I think having that in the US is going to be a big asset. And I think they have the Serie, which is Italian soccer. It's not quite as big as the Premier League, but AC Milan is now owned by American ownership. So, you know, I think they'll probably be taking advantage more of that as we move forward.DIANE KING HALL: A different direction than I was expecting, Wade. I thought you were going to talk more about the impact of the writers and actors strike, which we'll certainly be watching if that, you know, how much longer that takes and when it becomes damaging or more damaging to these companies. But we will have to leave it there for now Wade Payson-Denney, thank you so much for the deep dive into Paramount.]"

""During extreme weather events, when electricity use may be high, ComEd has programs to help customers manage their energy use to keep bills low. We also have a wide range of bill-assistance programs should high energy use create a financial hardship.""Tips to Help Identify ScamsComEd will never call or visit your home or business and demand immediate payment, especially with a prepaid cash card, cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, third-party payment app like Cash App, QuickPay, Venmo or Zelle, or through a QR code.ComEd will not ask for your ComEd account number unless you contact us first to enroll in a ComEd program or service.If you suspect a text, email or in-person visit is a scam, call ComEd at 800-EDISON1 (800-334-7661), or a trusted number, such as the one on your electric bill.If approached by a person identifying themselves as a ComEd employee, know that all ComEd field employees wear a uniform with the blue ComEd logo and visibly display a company ID badge with the logo and employee’s first name. ComEd underwent a logo change in 2022, so you may continue to see the red ComEd logo on uniforms, badges and vehicles until it is phased out.Story continues""With the summer heat, scammers often try to take advantage of extreme temperatures and threaten businesses and people with cutting their power off. This is part of a bigger problem we call imposter scams and know that ComEd will never call you threatening a cut-off,"" said Steve Bernas, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau. ""Another tip-off to the rip-off is anyone demanding immediate payment, and often requesting funds using unconventional forms like wire transfers or gift cards. We advise you to hang up the phone and contact the company directly.""ComEd Bill-Assistance OptionsScammers often find success with individuals and businesses that may be behind in their bills and pressure them into sending immediate payment. For anyone facing difficulty paying their electric bill, ComEd offers a number of payment assistance programs to help customers avoid late notices and disconnection, including grants, deferred payment plans and energy-saving tips.

Net income for the period also benefited from higher interest income due to higher cash balances and interest rates.Higher second quarter 2023 results reflect $31 million of third-party fractionation costs and $9 million of costs related to the pending Magellan merger transaction. Second quarter 2023 net income also reflects approximately $9 million in interest expense related to merger transaction financing.UPDATE ON ACQUISITION OF MAGELLAN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS On May 14, 2023, ONEOK announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common units of Magellan Midstream Partners in a cash-and-stock transaction.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK's financial performance and to compare the company's financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables.ONEOK, Inc.

Meanwhile, its selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 1% to $587 million, helped by lower freight costs.""Under Armour is making progress,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel, adding that for better or worse, promotions would still exist across retail.Like rivals Nike and Adidas, Under Armour has seen demand for its products wane in North America, its largest market, though this has been partly offset by a strong rebound in China.The company's Asia-Pacific sales rose 14.5%, while its North American revenue fell 9.1%.The apparel retailer's inventories were up 38% year-over-year at $1.3 billion.""Under Armour hasn't necessarily tapped into the outdoor trend,"" said Jessica Ramirez, senior analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates. She added the company had gone into its ""own silo"", not engaging as many consumers as it could have.Shares of the Baltimore, Maryland-based firm dropped marginally in early trading.Still, the company reported a profit of 2 cents per share in the quarter, while analysts had expected a loss of 2 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.Quarterly revenue fell 2.4% to $1.32 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' estimate of $1.30 billion.Under Armour also reiterated its revenue and profit outlook for the fiscal year 2024.

UAA is likely to report a decline in the top line from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Aug 8 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1,301 million, indicating a dip of 3.6% from the prior-year fiscal period’s reported figure.The bottom line of this developer, marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories is also expected to decrease from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading. The consensus estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter has been stable over the past 30 days. The company reported earnings of 3 cents per share in the year-ago period.This Baltimore, MD-based player has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, Under Armour’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 20%.Key Things to NoteUnder Armour’s results for the fiscal first quarter are likely to have been hurt by a tough operating landscape, including inflationary pressures and adverse currency fluctuations. The company has been witnessing weak margins due to increased promotions and an unfavorable mix, which is associated with increased distributor and footwear revenues. These limitations, coupled with any deleverage in selling, general &amp; administrative expenses and product costs, are expected to have weighed upon the company’s quarterly performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s direct-to-consumer channel is pegged at $479 million, showing a year-over-year decline of 8.1%.On its last earnings call, Under Armour expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to decline in low to mid-single-digit on a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Management had projected a gross margin decline of 75-100 basis points, as higher planned promotions continue to outpace freight tailwinds. It had envisioned a loss per share of 3-5 cents for the quarter under review. UAA anticipated inventory to be up at a high 30s percentage rate for the first quarter. Management further cited that it expects supply-chain disruptions from prior periods to continue in the first half of fiscal 2024.On the flip side, Under Armour’s focus on strengthening its brand through enhanced customer connections, effective innovations, better price points and a new loyalty program appear encouraging. UAA’s strategy to focus on improving sales through product innovation, investments in the stores and acceleration of e-commerce capabilities are likely to have been positive.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Under Armour this time around.

AKAM is scheduled to release its second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.06%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.86%, on average.The company is expected to report higher revenues year over year, backed by healthy demand for security and cloud computing services. The strong emphasis on portfolio expansion through a combined approach of innovation and acquisition is a tailwind.Factors at PlayIn the second quarter, Akamai launched an enhanced security service with new premium features to strengthen protection against evolving cyber threats. The updated version will include greater assistance from Akamai experts, including technical advisory hours with engagement managers and support delivery managers, along with off-hours configuration assistance and quarterly customer business assessments. Premium offerings include better monitoring from Akamai’s Security Operations Control Center (SOCC), which allows rapid action from SOCC experts in case of a security breach. This is likely to have improved the company’s second-quarter earnings prospects.In the quarter-under-review, Akamai announced the acquisition of Neosec, an API detection and response platform based on data and behavioral analytics. Neosec's API security solution is likely to complement Akamai's market-leading application and API security portfolio and extend the latter’s visibility into the rapidly growing API threat landscape. The combined API solution portfolio is expected to put the company at the forefront of a critical emerging category of API security and augment its market position. This initiative is expected to have strengthened Akamai’s portfolio, accelerated commercial expansion and supported the top line.During the second quarter, Akamai announced the launch of the Prolexic Network Cloud Firewall, an advanced feature that empowers customers to define and manage their own access control lists. This enhancement offers greater flexibility in safeguarding their network edge. The company also introduced Brand Protector, an innovative solution designed to identify and disrupt phishing websites, fake stores and instances of brand impersonations.

Our revenue estimate for the compute vertical is pegged at $127.6 million, indicating growth from $106 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

The report also found that ransomware groups increasingly target the exfiltration of files, the unauthorized extraction or transfer of sensitive information, which has become the primary source of extortion. This new tactic indicates file backup solutions are no longer a sufficient strategy to protect against ransomware.Ransomware Kill ChainAccording to the report, adversaries are evolving their methods and techniques from phishing to put a greater emphasis on vulnerability abuse. As these adversaries shift tactics, LockBit has dominated the ransomware landscape, from Q4 2021 to Q2 2023, with 39% of total victims - more than triple the number of victims of the second-highest ranked ransomware group. Further analysis shows that the CL0P ransomware group is aggressively developing Zero-Day vulnerabilities, growing its victims by 9x year over year.Of all vertical industries, manufacturing saw a 42% increase in total victims between Q4 2021 and Q4 2022, underscoring the potential threat to global supply chains. LockBit was responsible for 41% of overall manufacturing attacks. The healthcare vertical saw a 39% increase in victims during the same period, and was targeted primarily by the ALPHV (also known as BlackCat) and LockBit ransomware groups.Other key findings of Ransomware on the Move: Exploitation Techniques and the Active Pursuit of Zero-Days include:Organizations with reported revenue of up to $50 million dollars were the most at risk of being targeted (65%) while organizations with reported revenue above $500 million dollars made up 12% of total victimsVictims of multiple ransomware attacks were more than 6x more likely to experience the second attack within three months of the first attackFinancial services organizations saw an increase of 50% in the total number of impacted organizations year over year while the retail vertical ranks third in the number of ransomware victims per industry and saw a 9% increaseStory continues""Adversaries behind ransomware attacks continue to evolve their techniques and strategies striking at the heart of organizations by exfiltrating their critical and sensitive information,"" said Pavel Gurvich, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Enterprise Security at Akamai.

It is typical of these groups to report details of their attacks, such as timestamps, victims names, and victim domains. It is important to note that these reports are subject to whatever each ransomware group has a desire to publicize. The successfulness of these reported attacks was not included in this research.This research focused instead on the victims who were reported. For each analysis, the number of unique victims within each grouping was measured. This victim data was joined with data obtained from ZoomInfo to provide additional details about each victim, such as location, revenue range, and industry. All data was within the 20-month time frame of October 1, 2021 through May 31, 2023.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Both contracts slid over 1% on Monday, breaking a six-day winning streak.Weak Chinese trade data weighsData released earlier Tuesday showed that China's imports and exports fell much faster than expected in July, with imports down 12.4% year-on-year, missing a forecast fall of 5%, while exports contracted 14.5%, steeper than an expected 12.5% decline.In particular, oil imports in July to China, the top crude importer, were down 18.8% on a monthly basis.Economic weakness in China has weighed on the crude markets this year, as the world’s second-largest economy was expected to rebound swiftly from its COVID restrictions, providing fuel consumption growth while many of the Western economies struggled with aggressive monetary tightening.Strong dollar, inflation uncertainty weighsStrength in the dollar, amid growing uncertainty over the path of U.S. interest rates, also weighed on the price of oilThe greenback saw increased bids this week as investors positioned themselves for a potentially stronger consumer price index inflation reading on Thursday. While U.S. inflation decreased substantially this year, it still remained well above the Federal Reserve’s annual target range, potentially attracting a sustained hawkish stance from the central bank.Rising interest rates, or even higher-for-longer rates, are expected to weigh on economic activity in the remainder of the year - which investors fear could stymie global oil demand.U.S. crude stockpile estimates dueAttention will soon turn to the latest U.S. inventories data, which could provide clues about current demand in the world’s largest consumer.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, is scheduled to release its estimate of U.S. crude inventories later in the session and is projected to show another drawdown after last week’s hefty fall.Story continuesProduction cut extensions had boosted sentimentDespite the losses this week, the crude market had climbed to four-month highs last week as extended production cuts by major suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia had raised expectations of tighter supplies.Saudi Arabia announced on Thursday that it will keep trimming production by 1 million barrels per day through September, while Russia said it will cut oil exports by 300,000 barrels a day.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesOil prices fall sharply after weak Chinese trade dataBiden to protect vast sacred lands near Grand CanyonU.S. farmers expect corn harvest could be second-biggest ever]"

The U.S. crude benchmark gained almost 20% over the past month-and-a-half, reaching $83.23 last week for its highest since April.London-based Brent crude settled the U.S. trading session down 90 cents, or 1.04%, on Monday at $85.34. Like WTI, Brent also hit three-month highs last week, reaching $86.64, and gaining about 17% over the past six weeks.Monday’s price slide came after the Saudis announced last week that their daily production cut of one million barrels per day, enforced in July and August, would be extended to September.Russia chirped in on the Saudi announcement, saying it would shed 300,000 barrels per day from its own exports.Topping those measures, was a hike on Monday by the Saudis in the selling price of their crude to Asia and some European destinations.“Also dragging oil prices down is the rising expectations that the U.S. will see a recession by the end of 2024,” Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, added, citing a Bloomberg investor poll that showed two-thirds of 410 respondents expecting a recession by end-2024, and 20% seeing one by end-2023.OPEC's history is poor on winning when demand is downTo hear it from both ends of the market, one constituency (the bears) sees demand weakening with the approach of the Sept 4th Labor Day, where summer travel will officially wind down, meaning less pump sales of gasoline thereafter.The other side, (the bulls), are staying on the messaging that Saudi production cuts will tighten the market — and, hopefully, balance out any lack of buying.Story continues“You can’t cut your way to prosperity in the absence of demand, and we’ll see how successful the Saudis can be with that,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “I know OPEC has poor history on that.”Adding to the weight on oil Monday was the dollar’s run-up for a fourth time in six sessions as traders reacted to the odds of the Federal Reserve raising rates again in September, especially if key inflation data this week comes in higher than desired.Dollar weight also working against oil bullsThe United States is to release on Thursday its July reading for the key Consumer Price Index, or CPI, which will show how much further the Fed has to go with rate hikes.The CPI, which rose by 3.0% year-on-year in June for its smallest growth in two years, is expected to have seen a slightly more aggressive expansion of 3.3% in July. The Fed’s target is just 2% per annum.The Fed has identified runaway jobs growth and correspondingly higher wages — as well as trillions of dollars of relief spending over the 2020 coronavirus outbreak — as among reasons for inflation hitting 40-year highs of more than 9% a year in June 2022. While the pandemic spending is over, jobs and wage growth have continued to fuel inflation, prompting the Fed to keep adding to interest rates.Since March 2022, the central bank has hiked rates by 525 basis points from a previous 25. Its next rate decision is on September 20.Rates, already at a 22-year high, need to rise further as inflation remains above tolerable levels for the average American, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Monday.“We have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above the FOMC's two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight, with job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers,” Bowman said in a speech, referring to the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee of the central bank. “I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC's goal.”Related ArticlesOil dips; Saudi cuts mania at cross-roads with slowing U.S. road travelGoldman Sachs' Jeff Currie, who predicted commodities supercycle, to retireOil retreats from 4-month highs ahead of key inflation data]"

(Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP) (Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP)Films like Disney's ""Elemental"" and Warner Bros.' ""The Flash"" struggled to secure ticket sales earlier this summer, while the hyped-up live-action ""Little Mermaid"" fell short of expectations.Robbins said many of the laggards this year, such as ""Indiana Jones,"" had been out of the public consciousness for years while there has also been oversaturation in the market when it comes to franchises.""We're in a time now where people are a little bit more selective with what they're choosing to spend their money on,"" he said.Wall Street analysts have also turned bullish amid the ""Barbenheimer"" hype.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Overweight rating on Cinemark's (CNK) stock and upped his price target to $24 a share, an increase from the prior $22.Story continues""Conviction in studios and consumers embracing theatrical has been further reinforced by the Barbenheimer summer,"" the analyst wrote in a new note, despite the overhang of the double strike in Hollywood.Strike uncertainties loom for theater chainsPicketers carry signs on the picket line outside Universal Studios on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023, in Universal City, Calif. The actors strike comes more than two months after screenwriters began striking in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)Last month, actors joined writers on the picket line for the first time since 1960.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — announced the strike after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Warner Bros., Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA).The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents about 11,500 television and movie writers, called for a strike in early May. WGA leaders met with studio representatives on Friday to discuss restarting negotiations; however, no new negotiations have been set at this point as the standstill drags on.In a report released last month, Moody's predicted ""a relatively long strike,"" which would hit movie theater companies such as AMC and Cineworld (CINE.L) first, followed by diversified media companies with both streaming and linear television businesses.""If there is a protracted strike, cinema operators are most at risk with their nearly complete dependency on new product,"" Moody's said. ""Theatrical exhibitors are already strained from damage caused by the COVID pandemic such as lighter release schedules that followed and shortened distribution windowing. They also have mostly weaker balance sheets and credit ratings.""Still, Morgan Stanley's Swinburne said the uncertainty created by the strikes won't last forever.""Labor strikes create uncertainty, but ultimately it is temporary,"" he wrote. ""While visibility remains limited here, in our view, unless production remains shut down beyond late-fall, we see limited impact on the '24 slate. Strikes-aside, studios continue to build back production and we expect increased film supply from both traditional and streaming studios over the next few years.""Not everyone agrees, however.Richard Greenfield, media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners, told Yahoo Finance he foresees the strikes lasting until at least November, adding the prolonged work stoppage will be ""very disruptive"" to the business of Hollywood in the fourth quarter.""This is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize,"" the analyst warned.Late last month, Sony reshuffled its 2023-2024 film schedule, citing the strikes.""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" — the sequel to the widely successful ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" — was quietly removed from the 2024 release calendar. It was expected to hit theaters on March 29, 2024.Recent reports have said studios like Warner Bros. and Disney are also weighing changes to their respective slates as a direct result of the strikes.Variety reported Warner Bros. is ""strongly considering"" pushing the highly anticipated ""Dune"" sequel to next year from its current Nov. 3 debut.

What struck me during our conversation - and what I found so impactful - was how our respective efforts to support this shared mission are so deeply interconnected.With 92 percent of jobs available today requiring digital or likely digital skills and nearly one-third of U.S. workers lacking opportunities to build these skills, targeted development programs are essential to closing the skills gap - and digital divide - while spurring critical job placement and increasing diversity and equity in the workforce.$1B Commitment to reach tens of millions of people.In Comcast's efforts to advance digital equity, we consider the economic mobility of every individual and in turn, how it impacts our economic competitiveness as a country. Project UP ­- our $1 billion initiative to reach tens of millions of people with the resources they need to succeed in a technologically advanced world - is an intentional commitment to create opportunities that will change lives and communities for generations to come.Nothing we do is in isolation. As we consider ways to ensure digital equity, we can't ignore the many factors and circumstances that impact students' learning and access to opportunity. Therefore, we must think about solutions holistically.The Secretary and I were excited to highlight an example of the type of intentional collaboration that's needed. The Roybal Film and Television Production Magnet program in Los Angeles is equipping historically underrepresented students with the technology and digital skills required for success in media and entertainment. This program serves as a model for how industry-informed education can help create pathways to high-paying careers and drive our economy forward.Story continuesAs creator, producer, and director of Leguizamo Does America on MSNBC, John Leguizamo shared his invaluable expertise on leveraging the potential of students with skills like those developed at Roybal. More than 75 percent of the crew and production team were Latino or from communities of color and 90 percent of the creative or editorial team were Latino. And to pay it forward, the team promotes future talent, providing career opportunities, mentoring and shadowing to the next generation of creators. We're proud that the show has been renewed for a second season and while this work is remarkable, it should not be an outlier.We must continue to collaborate across the public, corporate, philanthropic, and nonprofit sectors to meet the challenges of achieving true digital equity. Getting more people connected to the power of the Internet through programs like the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program is stage one. Ensuring that ACP funding is extended, so that every student can be successful, acquire the right skills, and unleash their individual creativity and talent to the fullest potential is stage two.Secretary Cardona boldly and accurately stated that we must be unapologetically intentional about lifting up every one of our communities. Comcast is proud to join him and John Leguizamo in continuing to partner with incredible leaders working relentlessly to build a future of unlimited possibilities.Comcast is the founding member of Online For All, an Affordable Connectivity Program awareness and enrollment campaign launched by Civic Nation and the U.S. Department of Education.Dalila Wilson-Scott is Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, Comcast Corporation &amp; President, Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/772633/Advancing-Economic-Mobility-Through-Intentional-Collaboration]"

To answer this, we delve into a comprehensive valuation analysis. We invite you to explore our findings as we unravel the intrinsic value of United Rentals.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with MRNA. Click here to check it out. URI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of URIUnited Rentals, the world's largest equipment rental company, primarily operates in the United States and Canada. It holds approximately 17% of market share in a highly fragmented industry. The company serves three end markets: general industrial, commercial construction, and residential construction. Since its public inception in 1997, United Rentals has grown organically and through numerous acquisitions, expanding its fleet size to $19.6 billion. It offers a range of specialty equipment and items for indefinite rental periods.The company's stock price and the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, will be compared to provide a deeper understanding of the company's value. This will pave the way for a more profound exploration of the company's financial health and performance.United Rentals: A Fairly Valued Powerhouse in the Equipment Rental IndustryUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value at which the stock should trade. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesAccording to GuruFocus' valuation method, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's fair value is estimated using three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. At its current price of $485.86 per share, United Rentals has a market cap of $33.20 billion and the stock appears to be fairly valued.Given that United Rentals is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.United Rentals: A Fairly Valued Powerhouse in the Equipment Rental IndustryLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisAssessing the financial strength of a company before investing in its stock is crucial. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage provide a good understanding of a company's financial strength. United Rentals has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, which is worse than 95.76% of companies in the Business Services industry. The overall financial strength of United Rentals is 4 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is poor.United Rentals: A Fairly Valued Powerhouse in the Equipment Rental IndustryProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. United Rentals has been profitable 10 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $13.20 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $32.86. Its operating margin is 27.51%, which ranks better than 92.99% of companies in the Business Services industry. GuruFocus ranks the profitability of United Rentals at 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of United Rentals is 10.9%, which ranks better than 70.22% of companies in the Business Services industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 12.5%, which ranks better than 55.81% of companies in the Business Services industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, United Rentals's return on invested capital is 12.6, and its cost of capital is 11.33.United Rentals: A Fairly Valued Powerhouse in the Equipment Rental IndustryConclusionOverall, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 55.81% of companies in the Business Services industry.

Disappointing earnings numbers, rising treasury yields and a still-strong labor market dampened investor sentiment throughout the week. As a result, the market could not sustain the July momentum.However, August is traditionally one of the slowest months of the year for the stock market. Investors’ eyes will be firmly set on the consumer-side inflation numbers due this week, which would help them gauge the Fed’s mood.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies.

ANF have soared 37.4% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 7.8% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on May 26.Another stock, Abcam plc ABCM, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on May 22, has returned 36.5% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 6.8% increase) since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned +10.8% this year (through July 3) versus +16.1% for the S&amp;P 500 Index and +7.7% for the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index.

(Nasdaq: MU), today announced sample availability of the Micron CZ120 memory expansion modules to customers and partners. The Micron CZ120 modules come in 128GB and 256GB capacities in the E3.S 2T form factor, which uses PCIe® Gen5 x8 interface. Additionally, the CZ120 modules are capable of running up to 36GB/s memory read/write bandwidth1 and augment standard server systems when incremental memory capacity and bandwidth is required. The CZ120 modules use Compute Express Link™ (CXL™) standards and fully support the CXL 2.0 Type 3 standard. By leveraging a unique dual-channel memory architecture and Micron’s high-volume production DRAM process, the Micron CZ120 delivers higher module capacity and increased bandwidth. Workloads that benefit from more memory capacity include AI training and inference models, SaaS applications, in-memory databases, high-performance computing and general-purpose compute workloads that run on a hypervisor on premise or in the cloud.“Micron is advancing the adoption of CXL memory with this CZ120 sampling milestone to key customers,” commented Siva Makineni, vice president of the Micron Advanced Memory Systems Group. “We have been developing and testing our CZ120 memory expansion modules utilizing both Intel and AMD platforms capable of supporting the CXL standard. Our product innovation coupled with our collaborative efforts with the CXL ecosystem will enable faster acceptance of this new standard, as we work collectively to meet the ever-growing demands of data centers and their memory-intensive workloads.”""To accelerate the industry initiative to establish and expand the CXL ecosystem, Intel is collaborating with Micron to test and evaluate their CZ120 memory expansion module on our 4th generation Xeon Scalable processors and Xeon platforms,"" said Jim Pappas, director of Technology Initiatives at Intel.Story continues“AMD and Micron have had a long and successful history of collaboration. Since the introduction of our EPYC™ processors, we have validated Micron memory on multiple platforms powered by AMD EPYC processors. With the introduction of the CXL standard, we have extended our joint efforts to include the Micron CZ120 memory expansion module. We’ve recently tested our AMD EPYC 9754 processor with the CZ120 modules and are seeing impressive results in TPC-H benchmark performance compared to DRAM only,” said Mahesh Wagh, senior fellow of Server Systems Architecture at AMD.Qualified customers and partners that enroll in the Micron Technology Enablement Program (TEP) can rely on Micron’s world-class collaboration, quality and support. Additional TEP benefits include hands-on support to aid in the development of CXL-enabled designs; technical resources such as data sheets, electrical and thermal models to aid in product development and evaluation; and engineering consultation related to signal integrity and other technical support topics.Micron’s high-capacity, CXL-based memory expansion modules allow the flexibility to compose servers with more memory capacity and low latency to meet application workload demands, with up to 96% more database queries per day and 24% greater memory read/write bandwidth per CPU than servers using RDIMM memory alone.2 With 256GB Micron CZ120 memory expansion modules, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers can build servers with up to 2TB of incremental memory capacity.3 Adding more capacity means better performance and increased memory bandwidth without the need for more servers. By improving the use of compute and memory resources for enterprise and cloud applications, organizations can reduce their capital and operating expenses for their data center applications.________________________1 Measured by running MLC workload with 2:1 read/write ratio on a single CZ120 memory expansion module.2 MLC bandwidth using 12 x 64GB Micron 4800MT/s RDIMMs + 4 x 256GB CZ120 memory expansion modules vs. RDIMM only.3 By adding 8x256GB CZ120 memory expansion modules, system limitations may apply.Industry Quotes:“As a Contributor member of the CXL Consortium, Micron is helping to enhance the memory test and repair capabilities in the CXL specification to add the reliability, availability and serviceability features needed for enterprise and data center applications,” said Larrie Carr, president of the CXL Consortium.“Microchip Technology’s SMC2000 Smart Memory Controllers provide high-capacity expansion and performance with reduced latency overhead. Our collaboration with Micron has allowed us to harness their memory architecture expertise and combine that with Microchip controllers to rapidly co-innovate and create a CXL-based memory expansion solution designed purposefully to meet the needs of highly reliable AI and data center workloads,” said Samer Haija, director of marketing for Microchip’s Data Center Solutions business unit.“Supermicro’s continuing collaboration with Micron benefits a wide variety of key customers,” said Don Clegg, senior vice president of Worldwide Sales at Supermicro. “Micron’s CZ120 memory expansion module, which utilizes an E3.S form factor, PCIe Gen5 and leverages CXL for better memory functionality, complements Supermicro’s Petascale server and storage portfolio to deliver validated, tested, and proven solutions for data center deployments and memory-intensive workloads.”Visit micron.com/CXL for more information.Resources Section:CXL webpageSix Five Insider podcast interview with Ryan BaxterAbout Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

BrandsHut Life | Pizza Hut BlogJuly was National Culinary Arts Month, a time to showcase the amazing people who have helped create the amazing Pizza Hut menu. Although, here at Pizza Hut, LLC, we know there never needs to be an excuse to celebrate the incredible work the culinary team does year-round.To learn more about the Culinary Arts and what it takes to be a chef, we sat down with Pizza Hut U.S.' Innovation Chef, Alex Yeatts, to share what a typical day looks like for him, how he finds inspiration, and advice he'd give to someone who is looking to pursue a career in the Culinary Arts.What makes someone passionate about the Culinary Arts?""It stems from a love of food - in all forms - and it grows from there. I love experiencing other cultures through food and I'm too curious to want to recreate things in my kitchen that I have seen or eaten. You would be surprised how much history and culture is encapsulated in a dish or ingredients.""What does a typical day look like being the Pizza Hut, LLC Innovation Chef?""Honestly, it varies a lot - which I love. Some days, I'm exploring things completely new on my own. Some days, I'm working with our amazing partners in marketing or the folks on the food innovation team, improving recipes. On other days, I get to work with supplier chefs to bring new and trending flavors to life. I spend a lot of time in our test kitchen, not a desk, and I wouldn't have it any other way.""What is the best part about working on this team?""The support of all my coworkers! I have worked a lot of difficult jobs in my life, and I have learned the value of people who support you, fight for you, and lift you through difficult or stressful times. They are the ones that can make a tough day feel like the easiest day in the world when they are there for you. I am lucky to have so many people that value me at work.""Story continuesWhat product(s) are you most proud of that helped develop?""As a part of my role, I create the ‘gold standard' version of something - which is like the best version of a dish or ingredient. For example, if you were going to describe the best attributes of grilled cheese, what would that be? The gooey, melty cheese? The lightly toasted crust? The golden-brown color? The buttery, toasted bread? Those are the sort of things I help establish for all the things I create. I created the gold standard steak recipe for the cheesesteak pizza and melt. The rest of the team works with the suppliers to replicate it as closely as possible. I also created the recipe for the Pickle Pizza recipe with Nashville Hot Chicken that was launched in NYC for one weekend as a pop-up PR event. That was a lot of fun. Those are just the things that you would have seen so far. The Culinary team is very excited about the Melts platform and how we can leverage trending ingredients and flavors to create recipes customers crave.""Where do you find inspiration for new menu innovations?""A lot of it revolves around what is new and trending within the pizza industry, or restaurants in general. But I also dig into things I want to see on the menu myself. The Culinary Team has access to a lot of trends, research for flavors, ingredients, pizza styles, and so on. Social media is also a great tool to learn new things.How does the team determine whether an idea is worth pursuing a test market or national launch?""It depends on the product. It's easier to get things into a test market and then a national launch. National launches take more time because we want to be very thorough and have things as flushed out as we can. The Culinary and Marketing teams may put something in a test market so that we can learn more and get feedback before launching nationally. Not everything will go into a test market before a national launch. It just depends on how confident the Brand and Franchisees are in the product and strategy.""Is there anything people might be surprised to learn about being on the culinary team?""You may think as a major quick-service restaurant chain the team puts a lot of limitations or guardrails on us, but we are very open to exploration and putting new things out there. I hope that the culinary team continues to bring new ideas to life so that they can be shared with everyone. Pizza is an amazing platform, and the goal is to have the Pizza Hut® Brand continue to innovate and create delicious pizza that people crave.""What makes you most passionate about your job?""Creating food that becomes memories for people. Food is one of the most powerful things we have on earth. It brings people together and fuels memories of your childhood or happy times. Brings communities and cultures together. Some people take that for granted. When I cook (especially the food I hold close to my heart), I put a piece of myself in front of people. It may be from a memory in my life, or an obsession over a specific dish or ingredient. But, no matter what, it always has a story behind it. I just want to share those stories.""What advice would you give to someone who is starting a career in culinary?""Learn as much as you can from the people around you. Everyone has had a different experience in life and has learned things along the way - so take advantage of that. And pay attention to the food. If you pay attention to detail, you will learn a lot about the food you are cooking. Finally, don't be afraid to challenge yourself. If you try new things that are a little outside your comView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum! Brands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Yum!

JACK.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Restaurant Stocks to Enhance Your PortfolioThe U.S. restaurant businesses continue to thrive in 2023 after an impressive turnaround last year. This industry suffered major jolts during the coronavirus outbreak due to lockdowns and other restrictive norms to maintain social distancing. Sales at U.S. restaurants have not been impacted much despite severe inflationary pressure.Strong Restaurant Sales in JuneThe Department of Commerce reported that sales at U.S. bars and restaurants came in at $88.9 billion in June, remaining the same as the upwardly revised $1 billion sales in the previous month. Year over year, spending on restaurants and bars climbed 8.4% in June.The restaurant space is the main driver of growth for overall retail sales. Steady consumer spending continued in June despite worries that the economy may enter a recession this year. Although higher interest rates made customers concerned, they spent lavishly at restaurants and bars.The industry body, the National Restaurant Association (NRA) stated “Despite the booming popularity of off-premises restaurant meals and snacks in recent years, pent-up demand for in-restaurant experiences — socialization, celebration, and culinary exploration — is strong, with 70% of respondents noting customer desire to gather on-premises.”Within the retail sector, the Zacks Defined Restaurant Industry is currently placed in the top 18% of all industries with a year-to-date return of 9.9%.Story continuesInnovative MeasuresThe restaurant industry is gradually witnessing improving sales. The improvement can be attributed to the enhancement in fundamentals such as modifications in business processes, staffing, floor plans and technology.Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, their sales-building initiatives, and cost- saving efforts have been acting as the major catalysts. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Oshkosh, PACCAR, Terex, KB Home and Vertiv are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesHere are our five picks of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Oshkosh is a producer and seller of a varied range of vehicle bodies and specialty vehicles. Frequent business wins and a comprehensive offering of innovative new products are set to drive Oshkosh’s prospects. Record consolidated backlog of $15 billion provides enough visibility for the coming years. The Hinowa buyout has accelerated Oshkosh’s electrification capabilities, providing growth opportunities across core and adjacent markets.Upbeat full-year 2023 outlook raises confidence. The company estimates full-year 2023 sales to be around $9.5 billion, up from the previous estimate of $8.65 billion.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OSK’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 21% to $7.38 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being 27.45%.PACCAR is a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks.

Shares for the Atlanta company fell slightly in afternoon trading.Domestic revenue slid 6.9% during the quarter, as average daily package volume fell 9.9%. The company offset that decline somewhat, however, booking a 3.3% increase in revenue per piece.CEO Carol Tome said during the company's conference call that union negotiations impacted its package volume the deeper into talks, and the quarter, that they got.“We expected negotiations with the Teamsters to be late and loud and they were,"" Tome said. ""As the noise level increased throughout the second quarter, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated.”UPS reached a tentative deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, potentially averting a strike that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.Under the agreement, which still needs to be approved by union members, full- and part-time union workers will get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more by the end of the five-year contract. The deal includes a provision to increase starting pay for part-time workers — whom the union says are the most at risk of exploitation — from $16.20 per hour to $21 per hour. The average pay for part-timers had been $20.Voting on the new contract began last week and conclude on Aug. 22.United Parcel Service Inc. earned $2.08 billion, or $2.42 per share, for the three months ended June 30.Adjusted earnings were $2.54 per share, which beat the $2.51 per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were looking for.Story continuesRevenue declined to $22.06 billion from $24.77 billion, missing Wall Street's estimate of $22.88 billion.Revenue for the domestic and international segments fell as average daily volume dropped.The global shipping industry has been dealing with a package volume decline in part due to unpredictable consumer spending. Spending has been volatile this year after surging nearly 3% in January. Sales tumbled in February and March before recovering in April and May. Rising interest rates are also playing their part, as the Federal Reserve has been aggressively hiking rates since March 2022. Last month the Fed raised its key interest rate for the 11th time in 17 months as part of its ongoing drive to cool the economy and curb inflation.UPS said that it now foresees 2023 consolidated revenue of about $93 billion.

In the run-up to the deal, as the union threatened to strike, customers diverted more shipments than expected to rivals, UPS CEO Carol Tome said on a conference call with analysts.Rival FedEx required that shippers ramp up volume ahead of the UPS contract expiration in order to guarantee deliveries during a potential strike.UPS customers shifted about 1 million packages per day to other providers, resulting in about $200 million of lost sales. Data suggests the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and regional rivals each picked up about one-third of that business, Tome said.""It's all hands on deck to get back the volume that was diverted as a result of the negotiations,"" she said, adding that the company expects to complete that effort by the end of 2023.Atlanta-based UPS also grappled with business losses in previous contract negotiations. Much of that is expected to return because customers want to take advantage of volume discounts.Voting by employees on whether to ratify the handshake labor agreement wraps up on Aug. 22. The deal includes wage hikes, ends a two-tier wage system for delivery drivers, adds one paid holiday and begins installing air conditioning in new delivery trucks next year. UPS retained flexibility for weekend service, temporary holiday workers and technology adoption.UPS forecast annual consolidated revenue to be about $93 billion in 2023, down from a prior view of about $97 billion, and said it expected adjusted operating margin this year of around 11.8%, compared with an earlier forecast of about 12.8%.Story continuesShares of UPS were down about 1.0% in mid-afternoon trading, while FedEx shares were up about 2%.UPS said it would detail labor costs from the deal after it is ratified by employees.'STAY ON STRATEGY'UPS, often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, and other logistics companies are facing a global shipping demand slump from soft e-commerce and weak export and industrial production that has squeezed margins.The company reported adjusted profit of $2.54 per share for the second quarter, beating market expectations by 4 cents per share. Revenue fell about 11% and missed estimates of $23.1 billion, as per Refinitiv data.The quarterly profit beat ""underscores continued strong execution by UPS,"" Fadi Chamoun, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a client note. Nevertheless, Chamoun said the forecast revision calls for ""a very meaningful step down in profitability"" that has potential negative implications for 2024 and 2025.To shield its profit, UPS slashed costs and focused on moving high-margin parcels for healthcare and other businesses.Its U.S. division, which accounted for 58% of adjusted operating profit in the second quarter, cut labor hours by almost 10% and lowered its management headcount by 2,500. It also reduced flights by moving more air volume into its Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, and improved efficiency by shifting package flows from smaller non-automated buildings to larger automated facilities.""We will stay on strategy to capture growth in the most attractive parts of the market,"" Tome said.(Reporting by Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Paul Simao)]"

Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive.Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds. Amazon’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives.However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are also concerns. Intensifying cloud competition poses a serious risk.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Netflix shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+84.8% vs. +28.9%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind. Netflix’s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Netflix here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+6.7% vs. -3.6%). The company’s several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. The Zacks analyst expects the top line at around $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments. However, with higher utilization of the firm’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the margins.Marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise. A high debt burden induces a rise in interest expenses.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date basis (+66.2% vs. +43.5%). Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive.Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds. Amazon’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives.However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are also concerns. Intensifying cloud competition poses a serious risk.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Netflix shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+84.8% vs. +28.9%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind. Netflix’s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Netflix here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+6.7% vs. -3.6%).

The Zacks analyst expects the top line at around $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments. However, with higher utilization of the firm’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the margins.Marketing and business development expense is expected to rise. A high debt burden induces a rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Enbridge Inc.

The company’s strong focus on opening new stores is also encouraging. However, National Vision’s high dependence on a limited number of vendors is a concern. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a threat. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, National Vision’s shares have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 0.3% compared with the industry’s 18.1% decline.National Vision reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 revenues. Amid an uncertain macro environment, the company delivered positive comparable sales growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by strength in its managed care business.  During the reported quarter, the company opened eight new stores and ended the quarter with 1,357 stores. On a year-over-year basis, the company reported a significant decline in its earnings. The contraction of margins as a result of escalating expenses is discouraging too.During the quarter, National Vision opened four new America's Best and four Eyeglass World stores, and closed five stores. For America's Best and Eyeglass World growth brands combined, unit growth increased 5% from the total store base last year to 1,357 stores.Further, the company continues to roll out its remote care capabilities, which provide doctors with additional levels of flexibility and expand exam capacity in many areas. Per the company’s first-quarter update, it is on track with expansion into at least an additional 200 remote-enabled stores in 2023.National Vision Holdings, Inc. PriceNational Vision Holdings, Inc. PriceNational Vision Holdings, Inc. price | National Vision Holdings, Inc. QuoteWe note that National Vision plans to continue executing on core growth initiatives and investing in strengthening competitive advantages. In terms of store expansion, the company continues to see a sizable new opportunity with growth for many years to come. Despite many supply chain obstacles, during the first quarter, National Vision opened eight new stores and is on track to open nearly 65 to 70 new stores in 2023. The company noted that the new stores opened over the past 12 months are continuing to perform well and in line with the company’s expectations.Per National Vision, marketing continues to be a key factor in driving traffic to National Vision’s stores, given the infrequent purchase cycle for eyeglasses. In the current environment of high inflation, the company also noted that it continues to focus on marketing efficiency and is content to be leveraging marketing expenses this year.In 2023 so far, National Vision has spent $27.7 million on capital expenditures, primarily focused on new store openings and customer-facing technology investments. It remains on track for 2023 capital expenditure in the range of $115 million to $120 million to support key growth initiatives.The company’s merchandising and distribution teams continue to execute well and are confident that the current inventory levels are sufficient to support continued growth in 2023. Overall, National Vision continues to utilize its strong balance sheet and cash flow to invest in strategic initiatives to enhance customer experience and strengthen its market position.Story continuesOn the flip side, on a year-over-year basis, the company reported a significant decline in its earnings. The company’s gross margin contracted 45 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9.3%. Adjusted operating margin contracted 158 bps year over year.The company is facing demand headwinds across its network of stores, given the current macro environment, as well as a supply challenge in a smaller subgroup of stores due to the constraints on eye exam capacity.National Vision operates in a highly competitive optical retail industry. The companies within the industry generally compete based on recognition of the brand name, price, convenience, selection, service and product quality. National Vision competes with national retailers like LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks in the broader optical retail industry. Competition exists in physical retail locations along with e-commerce platforms. The company also faces competitive threat from online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. A number of firms are focused on selling eyeglasses in the online market like Warby Parker and Zenni Optical.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Intuitive Surgical ISRG.Zimmer Biomet has an earnings yield of 5.64% against the industry’s -3.72%. Zimmer Biomet’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and broke even in one, the average surprise being 4.47%.

Total Company revenue for the quarter was $2 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $254 million when excluding foreign exchange. Both Subsea and Surface Technologies delivered sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin, including a 420 basis point increase in Subsea to 14.4%, the highest quarterly margin since 2018.""Pferdehirt continued, ""Subsea inbound orders of $4.1 billion were exceptionally strong in the period, driving sequential growth of 29% in segment backlog to $12.1 billion. Subsea orders included six integrated projects, including the direct award of our largest iEPCI™ to date, a contract from Equinor for the BM-C-33 development in Brazil. Year-to-date, iEPCI™ has accounted for more than 50% of our order intake. We continue to expect iEPCI™ to achieve its highest ever inbound in 2023, enabled by a record level of iFEED™ activity that often converts to direct award.""""We continue to drive further adoption of our Subsea 2.0™ platform, with more clients recognizing the benefits of our configure-to-order product portfolio. In the quarter, we signed a 20-year frame agreement with Chevron, and we were awarded projects by Equinor and ExxonMobil that will utilize this unique technology.""Pferdehirt added, ""Subsea inbound for the first half of the year totaled $6.7 billion, giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook. We now expect orders to reach $9 billion in 2023. We anticipate 70% of these orders will come from a combination of iEPCI™, Subsea Services and all other direct awards, highlighting the quality of our inbound.""""The market backdrop remains very strong. The FEED pipeline continues to expand, with more projects in advanced stages moving towards final investment decision. Our Subsea Opportunities List, which highlights projects available over the next 24 months, remains robust. Longer-term visibility is also improving, with clients securing capacity for projects that extend to 2030. These are among the many tangible signs that support our view that this will be an extended market cycle.""Pferdehirt continued, ""Demonstrating our continued commitment to maximize shareholder value, we have initiated a quarterly dividend and doubled the size of our existing share repurchase authorization to $800 million. These actions build upon the $200 million of shares we repurchased over the last 12 months.""""We also announced a new commitment to return more than 60% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through at least 2025. This is supported by our confidence in achieving sustainable improvement in our financial performance and the strength of our long-term outlook. We intend to distribute a material portion of the improved returns to shareholders, and at the same time further strengthen our balance sheet.""Pferdehirt concluded, ""We have strategically placed ourselves in a very differentiated position. More than 90 percent of our total Company orders and revenue are generated outside the North America land market.

with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the second quarter 2023 Earnings Release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and describes performance on a year-over-year or sequential basis. Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC plc, excluding charges and credits, as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS, excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes, excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding foreign exchange gains or losses, net; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding foreign exchange, net; Corporate expense, excluding charges and credits; Foreign exchange, net and other, excluding charges and credits; and net debt) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items.

Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC plc, excluding charges and credits, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC plc, excluding charges and credits); Income before net interest expense and taxes, excluding charges and credits (Adjusted Operating profit); Depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits (Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding foreign exchange, net); Adjusted EBITDA margin; Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding foreign exchange, net; Corporate expense, excluding charges and credits; Foreign exchange, net and other, excluding charges and credits; and net debt, or cash are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation.

[Operator Instructions] Note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on second quarter 2023 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We’ll begin today’s call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we’ll conclude with a Q&amp;A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I’ll draw your attention to Slide 2 in a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL’s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.gas, energyPhoto by Frédéric Paulussen on Unsplash We will also refer to non-GAAP measures including earnings from ongoing operations on this call. For reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I’ll now turn the call over to Vince. Vince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let’s start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.15 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Overall, second quarter results were in line with our expectations apart from the continued mild weather and storm activity in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as this has been one of the most active storm years we’ve ever experienced. Between the mild weather and storm O&amp;M, our year-to-date results were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per share compared to our original plan. But despite these impacts, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. We have identified several areas in which we can offset the headwinds from weather and storms, and Joe will cover that in detail in his financial review. As you know, one area we remain extremely focused on is O&amp;M, and we are on track to achieve the $50 million to $60 million targeted reductions this year. And despite the incremental storm expenses, we are tracking slightly ahead of our O&amp;M forecast through June. We expect that trend to continue and improve through the second half of the year. In addition, today, we reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rate of 6% to 8% through at least 2026, as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This will be supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&amp;M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and clean energy future. Turning to a few second quarter operational highlights. We continue to deliver excellent reliability for our customers across our jurisdiction, again, despite the increased storm activity in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. This is a direct result of our ongoing investments, not only in system hardening that prevents outages, but also smart grid technology and automation that enables us to respond more quickly when outages do occur. On the integration of Rhode Island Energy, we remain well positioned to complete our transition services with National Grid next year. We also continue to make progress on an important filing before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, as we seek to deploy advanced metering functionality across our service territory and build a smarter grid that supports the state’s leading climate goals. Hearings before the Rhode Island PUC were held in late July to review our business case and cost recovery proposals. We expect a decision on our AMF filing later this fall. We also remain on track with the Kentucky CPCN process, which I’ll cover in more detail on the next slide. Finally, we continue to receive awards for our industry-leading approach in grid innovation as both the Edison Electric Institute and the Southeastern Electric Exchange recognized PPL Electric Utilities for its groundbreaking use of dynamic line rating technology. PPL Electric is the first utility in the nation to integrate this technology with its transmission management system. DLR sensors provide real-time information that enables us to better utilize our existing transmission line capacity and reduce gestion on the grid. FERC has also recognized the value that this technology can bring to the industry and better managing congestion on the transmission network. Turning to Slide 5 and an update on the CPCN process in Kentucky. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace 1,500 megawatt of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We remain confident our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. In May, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our request to consolidate the CPCN filing and our generation retirement request as required by Senate Bill 4. The commission approved the consolidation while keeping the CPCN procedural schedule largely unchanged. For the schedule, intervenor testimony was filed July 14 with no real surprises. Next up is our rebuttal testimony due August 9, followed by an info conference scheduled for August 15 to explore a potential settlement. Public hearings are then set to begin August 22 and could last several days. Again, we are very confident that the plan we’ve proposed is in our customers and the state’s best interest but we are also open to settlement discussions with the parties to the case. Ultimately, with or without a settlement, we anticipate a decision on our filings from the commission by November 6. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I’ll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let’s turn to Slide 7. As Vince mentioned, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in Q2 2022. The Primary drivers of $0.01 per share decline from last year were lower sales volumes in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania driven by mild weather and as expected in our plan higher interest expense due to increased borrowings at higher interest rates to fund our growth. Those factors were partially offset by lower O&amp;M expense, driven by our continued focus on operating efficiency and improved earnings at the Rhode Island segment from 2 additional months of results in Q2 2023 compared to the prior year. Overall, our teams performed well for the quarter and results were slightly ahead of expectations, apart from the mild weather, which impacted results by $0.03 per share compared to our forecast. Degree days were lower by more than 20% in our Kentucky service territory and by over 35% in Pennsylvania. This resulted in lower actual electricity sales volumes of 4% in Kentucky and 8% Pennsylvania compared to normal. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense partially offset by higher transmission revenue and higher distribution rider recovery. Our Kentucky segment results decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by the lower sales volumes and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower O&amp;M expense. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year, reflecting the additional 2 months of earnings this quarter. Finally, results at Corporate &amp; Other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&amp;M expense and other factors that were not individually significant partially offset by higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 9. Our Q2 performance puts PPL’s GAAP earnings at $0.54 per share year-to-date through June 30. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.77 per share for the first half of 2023. Mild weather has unfavorably impacted our year-to-date results by a total of about $0.08 per share compared to our plan due to lower sales volumes. In addition, we have experienced higher storm-related costs of about $0.01 per share compared to our plan so far this year due to the significant storm activity. Importantly, we’ve been able to more than offset these increased storm costs and we are tracking favorably to plan on O&amp;M through the second quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast as we expect to offset the unfavorable weather and storm impacts due to the projected outperformance in several areas. First, the disc mechanism in Pennsylvania is projected to offset the lower sales volumes and higher O&amp;M experience in that segment. Second, we are tracking favorably on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, which we expect to provide upside compared to our plan. Third, the convertible debt financing that we executed in the first quarter will reduce our annual interest expense relative to our plan. And finally, we continue to optimize our discretionary O&amp;M. This includes contractor and consultant spend, and the timing of filling open positions and other discretionary O&amp;M spend. In total, these identified offsets present a clear path to achieving the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. We have an excellent track record of achieving our financial targets, which we expect to continue in 2023. Looking ahead and our plans to achieve at least $175 million of O&amp;M efficiencies by 2026, we established a Transformation Management Office or TMO, to ensure we achieve our long-term efficiency objectives. The TMO, which I chair, with support from our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Information Officer, and with the engagement from our employees across the entire company is responsible for tracking our progress on savings initiatives as well as identifying and verifying additional areas of possible savings. To date, we have identified over 100 initiatives with savings potential significantly above our $175 million target. This structure and rigorous process gives us even more confidence that we will achieve the targeted savings assumed in our long-term forecast and it will help us deliver a more affordable clean energy transition for our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Vince. Vince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, we remain confident in achieving our goals for 2023. While mild weather and storms have created some headwinds, we have plans in place to overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to share owners. We’re also on target to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure improvements to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to go smoothly. We continue to progress our regulatory filings in both Kentucky and Rhode Island. And last but not least, we’re solidly on track to deliver our targeted O&amp;M savings as we execute our Utility of the Future playbook, incorporate more technology and automation and centralized various functions across PPL to deliver better value for customers and share owners alike. With that, operator, let’s open it up for questions. See also 15 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S. and 11 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this Week.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, guys. Pretty straightforward quarter here. I had two housekeeping questions. First, can you quantify what’s the AMI ask in Rhode Island? How much investment that is? Vince Sorgi: We’re in the $200 million range Durgesh? Durgesh Chopra: Got it. And over what time frame? Vince Sorgi: $250 million somewhere around there. Sorry, say that again? Durgesh Chopra: Sorry. Thank you. Over what time frame is that $200 million to $250 million? Vince Sorgi: Well, we need to get that approved, right? So we just went through the hearings late last month. We expect to have a decision by the commission up there in the fall of this year. And then that will kind of dictate the time frame over which we deploy that capital. Durgesh Chopra: Would that be incremental to your current CapEx plan wins? Or do you have some... Vince Sorgi: No, that’s in the current plan. Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the offsetting the year-date headwinds and weather and storm, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you mentioned like integration savings. Can you elaborate on that? How brings that pie obviously, it sounds like a lot of opportunities in excess of $175 million. But maybe just like what’s the upside on the integration and Rhode Island and what might be the other opportunities? Joe Bergstein: Yes. So the integration in Rhode Island Durgesh is going very well. Really, what we’re – have been able to do is exit TSAs quicker than we had expected and at a lower cost which is driving a lot of the outperformance we’re seeing there. We’re also mindful of the pace at which we’re hiring some of the open positions we have there. So we’re fully staffing up that operations and looking to take over completely from grid. And so those are the areas that are driving the Rhode Island integration. We would expect that to be about $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. As far as the progress on the $175 million and the establishment of the TMO, that’s going extremely well. As I noted, we have over 100 initiatives totaling more than $175 million. Really, it’s driven by significant employee engagement as we’re developing tends to implement and achieve the $175 million, the TMO also provides a forum for employees to share their ideas, areas that we could save on O&amp;M and be more efficient across the company. So I don’t want to give a dollar amount on that yet at this point as to where we are. We – part of the process of that brings a lot of rigor to the savings, we got to vet them all to complete business cases where needed. What I can tell you is that we are confident in achieving the $175 million and potentially more than that and the development of the TMO really is even enhanced that confidence as we’re working through this. Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks for the time. Vince Sorgi: Thanks, Durgesh. Operator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Paul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning, team. Thanks. Just to follow-up on that last question of Durgesh quickly. Is the TMO and those savings more about derisking and extending the outlook? Or is that something that could be incremental in the planning period? Joe Bergstein: Yes. So we will have to go through all of those items. I mean, it certainly de-risk and give us confidence in the $175 million through the planning period, whether those items that are in excess of the $175 million we will have to see whether they come into this period for execution, whether they are longer-dated items. And look, there is headwinds that we have to offset as well. We still see inflation and interest rates. So we have a bank of ideas and opportunities to execute on should we see those headwinds persist or increase, and then it just gives us confidence in the near-term to achieve the $175 and the 6% to 8% earnings growth, and it gives us confidence in the longer-term to continue to execute on the strategy. Vince Sorgi: Yes. I would reiterate that, Paul. I think it gives us both, right? Certainly, shores up the confidence in the $175 million, but likely gives us upside potential looking beyond that. Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thank you. Very clear. And then switching topics. I noticed the weather-normalized sales volumes were decently down in the quarter and now trailing 12 months, both Pennsylvania, Kentucky. Just could you give any color on what you’re seeing on the ground and just expectations for the second half of the year? Joe Bergstein: Yes, sure. So well, from a second half of the year, we would expect we have in our forecast normal weather. From our longer-term forecast, we continue 50 basis points of sale of the growth in our plans in total and we continue to be – believe that, that’s an achievable growth forecast. Some of the near-term impact that we’re seeing, particularly on the residential side has been due to energy conservation with the rising commodity prices. I would expect that to be a shorter-term anomaly given that we’ve seen a significant decline in commodity prices already this year and we would expect longer-term to see growth in residential usage as electric vehicles and electrification becomes more prevalent. Lower industrial sales in Kentucky have not really impacted our margins.Those customers more are demand-driven than usage. As we think about longer-term, there is a number of factors that give us confidence in our assumptions. We continue to see positive economic factors in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued flow unemployment rates and strong GDP growth. As we’ve discussed in numerous times in Kentucky, we’re coming off of back-to-back record years of economic development of over $10 billion of ounce investments in each of ‘21 and ‘22. That includes the Ford EV battery plant initiative, which we’ve talked a lot about. That’s broken ground and well under construction. The state is targeting another $8 billion of investment for 2023. So when we look at the 10 years prior to this period from 2010 to 2020, there was an average of about $4 billion per year in economic development. So to see $10 billion in each of ‘21 and ‘22 and projecting $8 billion this year highlights the Kentucky is a great place to do business and continued economic development there in support of our growth assumptions. But we continue to see strong industrial growth in manufacturing and agricultural sectors as well. Vince Sorgi: Yes. We’re not concerned with volumes at all other than the impact on weather. I would say our volume story is really weather-driven. Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detailed answer. Appreciate it. Vince Sorgi: Sure. Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro: Hi. Good morning. Vince Sorgi: Hi David. Good morning. David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Let’s see. I think just one here. I was curious, we are starting to see some easing of supply chain pressures in the solar industry, commodity costs coming down, module prices declining somewhat and PPA prices easing. I was just wondering if you think that could impact at all the outlook for your Kentucky, just the generation mix maybe longer term, or other opportunities to see lower PPA prices or lower costs in the current CPCN filing or if you’re thinking an analysis has evolved at all for the longer term generation mix there? Vince Sorgi: Yes. Look, I think the bigger issue in getting our solar deployed in Kentucky is citing and permitting days as opposed to necessarily the supply chain issues, although you are right, they have been an issue across the industry, and that is starting to abate. In our case, though I think it is more citing and permitting, which I think the company-owned solutions make that much easier because we can navigate that easier than third-party developers have been able to so far. So, as you know, our CPCN has a combination of company-owned and PPAs in it. We will continue to look at the executability of those PPAs and that if we continue to see issues there that could actually push us more to recommending more company-owned where we have a higher degree of confidence that we can get them built. David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. That’s helpful color. I didn’t appreciate that in the backdrop there. That’s all I had. Thanks. Vince Sorgi: You’re welcome. Operator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza: Hey. Good morning guys. Vince Sorgi: Good morning Shar. Shar Pourreza: Good morning. So, Vince, I just want to – starting with the Kentucky CPCN filing. I mean, obviously, thanks for the incremental color in the prepared on the timeline. As we look ahead to the prospects for settlement. You mentioned August 15th formal conference. I guess what could that look like? Is it partial, maybe the gas, but not the renewables? Just any additional color on how to think about that would be great. Vince Sorgi: Well, look, I think you can appreciate, I don’t necessarily want to get into negotiating positions at this point on the call. But what I will say just around the process itself is we are actively engaged right now with various interveners. As you mentioned, the settlement conference is scheduled for the 15th, if that goes well, and we can get settlement on at least significant issues in the case with enough parties. Then we may be able to present a stipulation to the PSC for their consideration. As you know, the hearings are scheduled to begin on the 22nd of August. That could become a forum for the PSC to take up the settlement agreement, if we’re able to reach one. But at this point, I would say, Shar, it’s too early to tell if we will be able to reach a settlement. But if we don’t, of course, we are ready to defend the plan as filed, as we have been indicating all along. So, a little early at this point to tell if we can get there, but certainly, we are open to those discussions.Shar Pourreza: So, let me just drill down a little bit on the defending side. In the off chance there are issues with the CPCN, right? Do you – I guess Vince, do you have avenues, either through pollution control or T&amp;D work to offset that space in your CapEx plan, I guess in a scenario where there is issues. And then do me a favor, could you just maybe frame what – how much of that CapEx you could see being backfilled, right, in that worst-case scenario? Vince Sorgi: Well, look, I think the key takeaway is I am not sure I would expect whether we have a settlement or fully litigating our case that, that would have a material impact on either our capital plan or our EPS targets given the different buckets of CapEx, whether it’s building replacement generation or environmental spend or other types of CapEx that we might deploy in Kentucky and elsewhere across the fleet. If you look at the testimony and based on everything that’s been filed to-date, I don’t think the outcome, Shar, is going to be an all or nothing on the coal plant retirement. But when you look at the Good Neighbor Plan, which was consistent with what we were assuming in the CPCN, that would require SCRs on Gen 2, Mill Creek 1, Mill Creek 2, also a new cooling tower at Mill Creek 1. When you look at the MATS regs and the ELG regulations, especially the ELG regs, that could result in significant incremental investments if we were required to do so. So, even if it was a full rejection of the retirements, which again, I don’t think that will be the outcome. As we have talked in the past, that’s in the $500 million to $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx. That doesn’t even include the amount of maintenance capital we have to spend on those plants going forward. So, again, I am not sure the outcome necessarily impacts the CapEx and EPS trajectory. It might just be different buckets where we are spending that capital. Shar Pourreza: And then just lastly, that bucket you are going to be spending that capital. This is obviously the worst case scenario, so no ones are assuming this. But in the case that it does turn out to be negative, that incremental capital doesn’t have a timing lag, right? So, you can go ahead and recognize it fairly immediately where we wouldn’t keep divits in your earnings growth in the near-term. Vince Sorgi: Some of that CapEx would have to – we would have to start spending that right away to continue to operate those plants. And that, to your point, that would be recoverable under the environmental cost recovery, which does not require a base rate case for recovery. Shar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Have a great weekend. Appreciate it. Vince Sorgi: Thanks. Operator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead. Vince Sorgi: Hey Greg. Gregg Orrill: Hey. Yes. Thanks. This may be repetitive. I know you said that the testimony from intervenors was kind of in line with expectations. Did you learn anything about their positions that was incremental to the process that – or the process itself that you are willing to share? Vince Sorgi: Not really, Gregg. I would say the testimony was as expected. I think we talked about expected intervener positions when we rolled out the plan that we filed. So, we knew the coal association would be against retiring coal. We knew the environmental intervenors would be pushing more renewables. Again, our plan, we think balances all of those interests. But more importantly, it complies with SB-4, it complies with our obligations to serve lease cost, reliable, safe energy. It is increasingly cleaner which we are hearing a lot from our customers and from our two major cities in Louisville and Lexington. So, we were extremely thoughtful and took a lot of actually intervene or input from the IRP process into coming up with what we proposed. As I have talked about, however, we are willing to engage in settlement discussions with the parties, and we will see if we can reach something here in the next couple of weeks going into the hearings beginning on the 22nd. So, I would say, as expected and we incorporated most, if not all of that into the original plan that we filed with the commission. Gregg Orrill: Alright. Thanks. Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell: Good morning Vince. Good morning Joe. Vince Sorgi: Good morning. Anthony Crowdell: I just wanted to follow-up on Shar’s question just one, and I am not sure you can answer it. Do you know if the commission in Kentucky would prefer the parties reach a settlement or given maybe with the closure of plants or whatever, that they are more buyers or they prefer a fully litigated track to have maybe a stronger record? Vince Sorgi: I don’t know that they have a preference one way or the other. Anthony, to be honest with you, they are going to uphold their obligation to ensure whether it’s a settlement or our case that it meets the requirements of SB-4 and again, our obligation to serve in a lease cost reliable way. So, they are going to do their duty regardless of what’s in front of them, whether it’s a settlement or our case. Not sure if they have a preference on which one is in front of them. I mean they will take a settlement as evidence in the case. They don’t have to approve the settlement, but they will certainly take it as evidence in the case. The authority really lies with them in terms of whether or not to accept that or not.Anthony Crowdell: Great. And then just lastly, I believe the company has been successful in reaching settlements in the past in Kentucky. Has – I guess my memory is getting a little foggy. I believe the commission has approved those settlements and not modified them. Is that accurate? Vince Sorgi: So, you are right. Generally, we have been able to reach settlement with the parties to our cases. The commission has modified them slightly in the past, nothing to material. At times, they have accepted them as filed. And other times, they have modified them, I would say, slightly. Anthony Crowdell: Good. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Vince Sorgi: Thank you, Anthony. Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks. Vince Sorgi: I just want to say thanks for joining us on the call. Feeling good about our progress so far year-to-date, looking forward to the second half of the year. And have a great weekend everyone and we will see you soon at the next conference. Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

""This brings concern about lack of storage, logistics. The sector as a whole needs to continue investing in storage.""However, companies demand legal security in order to approve new investments and take risks.""(We need) a clear and predictable regulatory framework to make investments in infrastructure,"" he noted.Sousa denounced criticism of the Ferrograo project based on ""biased"" assumptions in relation to the railway that will move millions of tons as soon once it is built.""One cannot be against Ferrograo. It is an irresponsibility,"" he added.In June, Brazil's Supreme Courtupheldthe suspension, pending studies, of a government plan to reduce a forest conservation park in the Amazon to allow for the building of Ferrograo.The railway, which stretches almost 1,000 kilometer (620 miles) and is considered strategic to move soybeans and corn more efficiently to export markets, would reduce reliance on roads but also affect local communities in Brazilian states like Mato Grosso and Para.

The press release announcing the company’s financial performance in the second quarter is anticipated next week.The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 23.52%. In the last reported quarter, CRISPR’s earnings beat estimates by 59.88%.Shares of CRSP have gained 25.4% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 12.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things might have shaped up for the quarter to be reported.Factors to NoteIn the absence of an approved/marketed product in its portfolio, the focus is expected to be on updates related to CRSP's pipeline candidates.The company’s top line comprises grants and collaboration revenues from its partnership with large-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.CRISPR, in collaboration with VRTX, is developing exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel, formerly CTX001) — an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy. It is doing so under two separate phase III studies for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).In June, CRISPR and Vertex announced that the FDA accepted their biologics license applications (BLAs) for exa-cel to treat SCD and TDT. The FDA granted priority review to the BLA filing for exa-cel in SCD indication and the exa-cel filing in TDT indication has been accepted for a standard review by the agency.The FDA’s final decision on the BLAs for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications is expected by Dec 8, 2023 and Mar 30, 2024, respectively. CRISPR and Vertex are also evaluating exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD in two separate phase III studies. An update is expected at the second quarter’s conference call.Story continuesCRISPR is also developing two gene-edited allogeneic cell therapy programs, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) candidates, CTX110 and CTX130, for hematological and solid tumor cancers.CTX130 is being evaluated in two ongoing independent early-stage studies. The idea is to assess the safety and efficacy of several dose levels of the candidate in adults with solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (COBALT-RCC study) and certain T-cell and B-cell hematologic malignancies (COBALT-LYM study).CRISPR is also advancing several next-generation CAR-T product candidates, namely CTX112 targeting CD19 antigen and CTX131 targeting CD70 antigen. These candidates have been designed to enhance CAR-T potency. Both candidates are currently being studied in early-mid-stage studies after being cleared for clinical study early this year.Updates regarding the progress of these development programs are anticipated in the upcoming earnings release. Activities related to the development of CRSP’s pipeline candidates are also likely to have escalated operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CRISPR this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: CRISPR has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at a loss of $2.18 per share.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the biotech industry, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Biotech Stocks in 2023.The biotech industry was the center of global attention during the pandemic. With accelerated efforts to come up with vaccinations to restore order to the world, the industry experienced a heavy boost. However, since the pandemic, the situation has changed. Although the global biotech industry is valued at $1.2 trillion according to Precedence Research, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% between 2023-2030, the industry has definitely slowed down, as it adjusts to the post pandemic biotech market. As the demand for vaccinations reduced, revenues have been dropping over the last couple of quarters. As per Ernst &amp; Young, revenues for public companies dropped by 1% in 2022. In addition to this, there are growing concerns that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will restrict acquisitions by larger pharmaceuticals. This would make it difficult for companies to secure funding and innovate. Furthermore, the United States passed a new legislation in August, 2022 – the Inflation Reduction Act. Its objective is to decrease inflation by reducing the federal deficit, and investing in green energy. However, this affects the biotech industry as prices for drugs are going to be lowered. The resulting pricing pressure represents a major risk for innovation in the biotech sector, as it becomes unclear how companies would be reimbursed. In the last year, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approvals for licenses were significantly reduced. Consequently, funding in biotech experienced a major decrease. This includes venture capital investment, debt financing, and IPOs. The biotech IPO market decreased by over 93% from 2021, with only 29% of European and American companies having cash reserves to last only a year. Don't Miss: 12 Best Biotech ETFs To BuyCurrently, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates. This would directly impact the ability for companies to raise capital and finance research and development. Furthermore, BioPharma Dive's data indicates that as of April 2023, more than 5,000 workers have been laid off from biotech and pharmaceutical firms this year alone. All of these challenges contributed to the industry performing poorly, as share prices plummeted from a historic high in 2022 as well. Story continuesInvestors looking to invest in the biotech sector can look into the performance of Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc (NASDAQ:APLS) before making any decisions. Our Methodology We used a stock screener and filtered out biotech stocks with market caps above $2 billion as of August 7. We did this to eliminate extremely small companies which have volatile performance and are not an appropriate indicator of the biotech industry performance overall. Then, we sorted the stocks in the descending order of their year-to-date share price performance. From the resulting dataset, we selected the biotech stocks with the highest YTD share price declines as of August 7. The following stocks are arranged in the ascending order of their share price declines.15 Worst Performing Biotech Stocks in 2023Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashWorst Performing Biotech Stocks in 202315.

The company’s revenue of $954.61 million also exceeded analysts’ expectations by $44.2 million. This has led the company to revise its full-year 2023 guidance, and it now expects to close the year with a revenue ranging from $2.58 billion to $2.63 billion. Nevertheless, the shares have tanked almost 18.5% year-to-date, making Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) one of the worst performing biotech stocks in 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY), compared to 38 hedge funds in the previous quarter.

David Witzke and Michael Gregory’s Avidity Partners Management is the largest shareholder of the company, with 2.12 million shares worth $85.2 million. 12. Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)YTD Share Price Decline as of August 7: 19.28%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) specializes in the research, development and commercialisation of treatments for different human diseases. On May 8, Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) announced a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03, which missed the consensus estimates by $0.01. Moreover, it has reported a revenue of $79 million, also falling short of the Wall Street forecast by $0.72 million. Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MRVI), in contrast to 22 from the previous quarter. Joel Ramin’s 12 West Capital Management holds the largest position in Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI), with 2.5 million shares worth $36 million.ClearBridge Small Cap Value Strategy had this to say about Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Another detractor during the period was Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI), which provides products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics, novel vaccines, and support research on human diseases. The company continues to face headwinds from both investor skepticism over the loss of its COVID-19 revenue and continued supply chain disruptions in the company’s bioprocessing consumables division, which weighed on the stock’s performance. We believe the value of the company’s nucleic acids business has been overly discounted relative to its long-term potential, and that the company’s position as a leading supplier to the growing field of mRNA vaccine research and development leaves it well positioned to be a long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR)YTD Share Price Decline as of August 7: 19.40%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR) focuses on the research and development of RNA-based solutions to different kinds of diseases in the United States. It classifies as one of the worst performing biotech stocks this year. On May 2, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR) reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.45 and a revenue of $146.26 million, beating market estimates by $1.06 and $100.78 million, respectively. However, the stock plummeted on July 7 due to insider selling by Tracie Oliver, the chief commercial officer for Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR) and James Hamilton, head of the non-clinical and early clinical development.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter. David Witzke and Michael Gregory’s Avidity Partners Management held the largest position in the company, with 1.7 million shares over $44 million. Baron Opportunity Fund had this to say about Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARWR), a biotechnology company specializing in RNA interference (RNAi) medications to treat a variety of diseases, detracted from performance. The company has lacked major wins in recent years, while also tallying some losses. Management’s late-stage drug licensing efforts to drive upfront and running royalties to bolster its balance sheet and ensure a longer cash runway have also pressured shares. Reinvigorating the company’s strategic story remains a key consideration for Arrowhead going forward. Last year, we reduced our portfolio weighting in Arrowhead but decided to maintain a foothold position. We believe Arrowhead’s efforts to target RNAi to the lungs will open a new therapeutic area of exploration. In our view, this initiative may lead to RNAi economies of scale, allow for an expansion of pipeline and collaboration opportunities, and generate a long runway for growth.”10. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY)YTD Share Price Decline as of August 7: 21.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you I would now like to hand the call over to Matt Murphy, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Matthew MurphyThank you, operator, and good afternoon. After market closed today, Cara issued a news release announcing the company's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2023. Copies of this news release and the associated SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.caratherapeutics.com. Before we begin, let me remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements about Cara and our programs based on management's current plans and expectations. These statements are being made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially due to various factors, and Cara undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements publicly as a result of new information or future results or developments. Investors should read the risk factors set forth in Cara's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and any subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris Posner, Cara's Chief Executive Officer. Chris?Story continuesChristopher A. PosnerThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. With me today are Ryan Maynard, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Joana Goncalves, our Chief Medical Officer; and Scott Terrillion, our General Counsel and Head of Government Affairs.I'd like to start by giving a quick overview of what I'll address today. First, I will give an update on the KORSUVA injection launch in the U.S., including clinic-level data to provide visibility into underlying demand trends across the different segments of the dialysis market. I will also briefly touch on the proposed calendar year 2024 ESRD PPS rule, which CMS published in late June. Next, I will review the Kapruvia launch progress in countries around the world. Then I will discuss our wholly owned pipeline and the progress of our 3 late-stage programs for oral difelikefalin. Finally, Ryan will provide a financial update, after which we will open up the call to Q&amp;A.With that, let me discuss the KORSUVA injection launch in the U.S. For the second quarter of 2023, net sales for KORSUVA were $11.4 million, translating into $5.4 million of profit recorded as revenue to Cara. Wholesaler shipments to dialysis clinics totaled approximately 67,000 vials, a 46% increase from the prior quarter. 67% of these vials were shipped to FMC clinics, with the remainder split between DaVita and the other DOs. This increase in vial shipments suggests a continued drawdown of inventory at FMC and an acceleration in demand across all DOs. Ongoing anecdotal feedback on KORSUVA from both providers and patients remains highly positive, highlighting that KORSUVA addresses a significant unmet need.At FMC, orders grew by more than 50% quarter-to-quarter, reaching 45,000 vials. By the end of the second quarter, over 700 FMC clinics, or 27%, had placed reorders. That's up from 18% at the end of the first quarter. More importantly, 1,300 clinics, or 50%, had dosed at least 1 patient. That's up from 42% at the end of the first quarter. Note, this is a correction. Based on numbers provided to us by FMC, we reported on our first quarter call that 1,500 clinics had dosed at least 1 patient. The growth in the number of FMC clinics reordering as well as clinics dosing a patient suggests continued drawdown of inventory at the clinic level. If this trend continues at the current rate, we believe that the majority of FMC clinics will have depleted their inventory and will be in reorder mode this year.At DaVita, we are seeing continued steady growth in demand. Orders grew by 43% quarter-to-quarter to 11,000 vials. Over 400 clinics, or 15%, had ordered KORSUVA at the end of the second quarter. That's up 11% at the end of first quarter. Reorder rates remained very encouraging, with 73% of clinics placing repeat orders. Given the on-demand approach at DaVita clinics for ordering KORSUVA, the growth in clinic orders represents a good proxy for the growth in patient demand. At midsize and independent DOs, KORSUVA utilization continues its momentum. Orders grew by 28% quarter-to-quarter to 11,000 vials. At the end of the second quarter, 17% of clinics in this market segment had placed orders. That's up from 13% at the end of the first quarter. In addition, 68% of these clinics placed repeat orders, and that's up 66% at the end of the first quarter.USRC remains the largest buyer of KORSUVA in the MDO and IDO segment. 73% of USRC clinics had ordered KORSUVA by the end of the second quarter. And 80% of these clinics have placed repeat orders. While KORSUVA continues to make meaningful progress in the U.S., a majority of the market remains untapped, and there is significant room for growth. Our partner, CSL Vifor, is fully committed to driving KORSUVA's uptake in this unique ecosystem with the goal of maximizing its commercial potential in the long term. Now I will briefly touch on the ESRD PPS proposed rule for calendar year 2024. This rule, once it is final, will determine the framework for KORSUVA's reimbursement after its TDAPA period. In late June, CMS proposed a new add-on payment adjustment for certain new renal dialysis drugs after the TDAPA period ends. The post-TDAPA payment adjustment applies to all dialysis treatments for a period of 3 years immediately following the expiration of the drug's TDAPA period. The proposed methodology calculates the add-on payment for each treatment based on the prevailing ASP and the drug's utilization during the most recent 12-month period. CMS also proposed a risk-sharing arrangement with ESRD facilities calculated at a 35% discount to the prevailing ASP to account for any declines in other drug expenditures.We are pleased that CMS proposed additional funding that is not budget-neutral for innovative TDAPA-designated drugs that fall into an existing functional category. We are also glad that the new funding starts immediately after the expiration of the TDAPA period and gets adjusted annually by the market basket update.However, there are certain limitations to the proposed methodology, which we plan to pointedly address with CMS in the coming months. Specifically, the add-on payment applies to all dialysis treatments and does not follow the patient. In addition, a 35% discount to the prevailing ASP does not take into account first-in-class drugs like KORSUVA that don't have a therapeutic substitute. Since the proposed post-TDAPA reimbursement methodology makes a drug's uptake during its TDAPA period a key factor in future reimbursement rate setting, we plan to also address the question around appropriate utilization data with CMS near term. More specifically, we will be laying out a case for additional TDAPA time. We will furthermore press for changes to the proposed methodology to account for innovative, first-in-class products that target a minority of ESRD patients. We will continue to work closely with CMS and provide information to highlight the best solution for broad and equitable patient access to innovative drugs like KORSUVA in the final rule, which is expected later this year.Next, on the international front. The rollout of Kapruvia in Europe is progressing well. In the second quarter, Kapruvia generated $1.2 million in net sales, translating into $123,000 of royalty revenue to us. Launches have begun in 7 EU countries, with more lined up in the coming months. CSL Vifor continues to report positive feedback from patients and providers, in line with the testimonials we have received in the U.S.We are pleased with the recommendation by England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, for Kapruvia for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease associated pruritus in adult patients on hemodialysis. In Japan, we continue to expect a regulatory decision in the second half of this year. As a reminder, approval in Japan would trigger a $2 million milestone payment to Cara. We are pleased with the progress around the world and believe the success of the ex-U.S. launch to date underscores the significant unmet need for an effective antipruritic treatment for hemodialysis patients.Last but not least, let me touch on the development progress of our innovative, wholly owned pipeline. Enrollment in our Phase III programs in pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and advanced chronic kidney disease is progressing well. We anticipate the internal readout of Part A of our KIND 1 AD trial in the fourth quarter of this year, with final top line results from this program in the first half of 2025. We continue to expect top line results for our KICK program in advanced chronic kidney disease in 2024. Our Phase II/III COURAGE trial in notalgia paresthetica commenced in the first quarter of 2023 and is tracking to the internal readout of Part A in the second half of 2024. We expect top line results for the KOURAGE program in the first half of 2026.We strongly believe that oral difelikefalin is the centerpiece of our strategy of becoming the leader in the treatment of chronic pruritus and the key to unlocking the long-term value of Cara. And we remain committed to driving progress of our pipeline and building our unique nephrology and medical dermatology franchises with oral difelikefalin.To summarize, we are pleased with the continued progress of the U.S. KORSUVA launch, as evidenced by the acceleration in file shipments and reorder rates across the dialysis landscape. Following CMS' proposal for a post-TDAPA add-on payment, we are engaging with CMS to discuss potential modifications to the proposed methodology as well as an extension of KORSUVA's TDAPA time. We hope to see meaningful changes reflected in the calendar year 2024 final rule later this year.Internationally, we continue to receive positive feedback from the rollout of Kapruvia, and we are optimistic about the growth trajectory as more countries come online. We also continue to execute on the most significant long-term value driver of our company, our differentiated innovative pipeline. Our 3 late-stage programs with oral difelikefalin have potential for tremendous value creation and set us apart as a leader in chronic pruritus. We remain laser-focused on advancing these programs in order to maximize the potential of difelikefalin within our 2 exciting therapeutic franchises.I would now like to turn it over to Ryan for additional details on our second quarter financial results. Over to you, Ryan.Ryan D. MaynardThank you, Chris. Total revenue was $6.9 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $23 million for the same period in 2022. Now, revenue this quarter consisted of $5.4 million of collaborative revenue related to our profit from CSL Vifor net sales of KORSUVA injection, $1.4 million of commercial supply revenue and $123,000 of royalty revenue representing our royalties from net sales of Kapruvia. Now, revenue in the same period last year included a $15 million milestone payment for the approval of Kapruvia by the European Commission, as well as $8 million of collaborative revenue related to our profit from CSL Vifor sales of KORSUVA. Cost of goods sold during the 3 months ended June 30, 2023, was $1.4 million and relates to our commercial supply shipments of KORSUVA injection to CSL Vifor. There was no cost of sales during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, as there was no commercial supply revenue from CSL Vifor.R&amp;D expenses were $30.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $19.9 million in the same period of 2022. The increase in R&amp;D expenses is primarily due to the increased clinical trial spend related to our 3 late-stage clinical programs, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based comp. G&amp;A expenses were relatively flat at $7.5 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $7.6 million in the same period of 2022. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 2023, totaled $101.7 million compared to $123.4 million at March 30, 2023. The decrease of $21.7 million this quarter was primarily due to cash used in operating activities. We expect that our current unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities are sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating plan for at least the next 12 months. This guidance assumes all the spend related to our 3 late-stage clinical development programs and KORSUVA revenue profit share contribution. We continue to work to extend our runway past the guidance by focusing on non-dilutive funding sources. Now back to you, Chris.Christopher A. PosnerThanks, Ryan. I want to again emphasize our confidence in the commercial potential of KORSUVA, Kapruvia in Europe, as well as the tremendous upside of our pipeline for oral difelikefalin. We continue to believe that our long-term strategy will make Cara the leader in the treatment of chronic pruritus and will deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.With that, Ryan, Jo, Scott and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, you can please open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from the line of Dennis Ding of Jefferies.Yuchen DingCongratulations on the progress in the second quarter. Two questions for me. Maybe -- how do you guys think about the trajectory in the second half and the state of the launch curve? I mean, outside of the -- outside of depleting inventory, what else needs to happen for the trajectory to really inflect in the back half of the year? And then my second question is around the CMS draft documents. Maybe remind us what you are looking for or pushing for in the final ruling in the Fall? And will it be considered a big win for Cara?Christopher A. PosnerYes. Thanks, Dennis. Nice hearing from you. So the first question, expectations for the remainder of the year. While we and our commercial partner, CSL Vifor, are not providing forward-looking guidance at this time, here's what I will say. We're certainly very encouraged with the accelerating trends in our key metrics, namely, vials being ordered by clinics that increased 46% versus the prior quarter. In addition, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're also seeing more and more clinics dosing patients, specifically at the 2 LDOs we're at FMC, Dennis, we're at 1,300 clinics dosing. That's roughly a 50% penetration. And at DaVita, we're about 410 clinics now dosing, but importantly, that's up over 40% versus the prior quarter.And most importantly, IV KORSUVA is really holding up in the clinic, and the feedback from both patients and providers has been highly positive. The reorder rates, meaning once the clinic starts dosing patients, there is significant buy-in to the product, as over 70% of these clinics continue and consistently place additional orders. And I'll just conclude with this, Dennis. Although we're kind of early in third quarter, I can tell you that the growth we see coming out of the second quarter, we are seeing it continue in the early part of the third quarter. And our commercial partner, CSL Vifor continues to be highly motivated, and their promotional efforts continue in full force. That's what I'll say about the second half of this year and our expectations.On CMS, let me introduce Scott, who heads up our government relations in addition to being our General Counsel. He has led the efforts with CMS over the last couple of years. So Scott, maybe you could address what we're doing with CMS.Scott M. TerrillionSure. Thanks, Chris. Yes, as Chris said in his remarks, with regard to the rule, we're pleased that there was new money added. That is great, and that's a very meaningful movement forward. In our interactions with CMS -- and it's not just us, the broader community is also taking up very similar issues with CMS. There's 3 things with regard to the proposed rule that we're going to be looking for. One is having the money follow the patient. That's particularly important with a product like KORSUVA, where it is going to be used in a minority of patients. We want to make sure that the funding and the reimbursement is tied to their clinical decision directly to make sure that patients get access to the product.The second thing we're going to be talking about is the 35% discount. Again, we do agree that some sort of set off for savings for drugs that are not going to be used in the bundle as a result of a new drug ought to be offset in some way. That's good fiscal policy, makes a lot of sense. However, with the drug like KORSUVA, where there isn't any money in the bundle, there isn't any money being spent to treat these patients or manage a condition before KORSUVA, we think it's important that the set off is rational and it's tied to the actual savings. And with KORSUVA, there's not going to be anything there.The third thing we're going to be looking for is for clarity after the third year because again, a drug like KORSUVA, there is no money in the bundle and what happens afterwards. So we're going to be seeking clarity on that.The other thing that we're going to be pushing CMS on and having a discussion about is making sure that there is a TDAPA period for KORSUVA that allows the community to use the product in the same and knowing what the reimbursement and funding mechanism after the TDAPA period ends. Right now, the product is being used in a context where there isn't any -- the thought is there would be no money added. So we're going to be trying to get the extra TDAPA period to try to make sure that there's good data that appropriately lines up to the patient access.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy of Stifel.Annabel Eva SamimySo I had a few actually. Just -- while we're talking about CMS, I guess a couple of things. I guess, first, can you maybe -- so I guess we understand the (inaudible) got an extra year of TDAPA payment. I was just wondering if you can outline what similarities or differences you might have had with Parsabiv, given that's pretty much the only other drug that's gone through this and how they got that additional year. And then if KORSUVA stays within the bundle the way that they've described, with this structure, do you envision incentives for dialysis providers to not use the drug and just collect the payments as they might have done for Parsabiv. So I just wanted to understand the dynamic that we might see post-TDAPA. And then I might have another follow-up.Christopher A. PosnerAll right Annabel, I think let me unpack. The first one is around extending our TDAPA period and the rationale why and why that is the same or different than Parsabiv. Let me give that to Scott, and I may have a couple of words after.Scott M. TerrillionYes, sure. So with regard to Parsabiv, it's -- it's not a great analog in one sense, because the Parsabiv, obviously, there was an oral generic that was used afterwards. But there is one similarity with regard to why it would make sense and be consistent. And with Parsabiv, CMS was looking to get accurate information to understand how much we might add to the bundle. And that's the same argument we're going to make. That at the end of the day, we don't believe that the utilization and the uptake is going to be accurate in an environment where there would be new money added at the end of the TDAPA period. So we think the precedent there with that regard, which is get better data is consistent with Parsabiv.Christopher A. PosnerYes. And Annabel, I think on your second question, hopefully, I got it right. Basically, if I understood the question right, the proposed methodology from CMS could suggest a reverse incentive, meaning that some of the dialysis organizations would be incentivized just to pocket the additional money and not use KORSUVA. I'll say a couple of things. I mean one is -- it's certainly -- they could do that. Our belief is that that will not happen. Dialysis organizations are very much used to working in the capitated environment, meaning they're going to lose some money in some patients and make some money on others. So we remain pretty confident that the appropriate patients will continue to have access to KORSUVA. And listen, we all have the same North Star around patients being at the center. And our kind of what we could control here at Cara and what we're really focused on is making sure that there is adequate and accurate funding so patients are going to have access to this drug. That's what Scott alluded to in his earlier comments, and that's really our focus.Annabel Eva SamimyI guess also, just to be clear, the payment also is recalculated every year, correct? So if utilization is down, that's going to go down.Christopher A. PosnerWell, technically, based on their proposal, that could happen, correct. But it would be calculated on an annual basis.Annabel Eva SamimyOkay. And then just to switch gears for a bit. Would you say that the reorder for DaVita, their independent dialysis provider is 70%. Is that about where you would expect reorder rates to be in a normalized environment for say, Fresenius when the (inaudible) wash out?Christopher A. PosnerYes, I would. I mean we've seen it pretty consistent in that 70%. I mean, DaVita's actually this month -- or this quarter was -- or second quarter, sorry, was 73%. It's interesting if you look at USRC, which is the largest of the MDOs. They're about an 80% reorder. But I think we feel pretty comfortable that they're going to be in the range in that 70% reorder rate. We've seen that pretty consistently. Really since the launch. And I've been really pleased. And Annabel, we've talked before, I've been incredibly pleased with that reorder rate. We don't get patient-level data. We do look at reorder rates as a proxy for, call it, a really good patient experience. And we see this consistent month-to-month reordering by clinics that have started dosing patients.Annabel Eva SamimyOkay. Great. And if I could just squeeze in one more. I did notice that you expected Fresenius to be reordering by the end of the year. Is that a change from your expectation of seeing normalized inventories by midyear?Christopher A. PosnerNo. I would say we've always expected -- I mean we're looking at the growth trends on the quarter-to-quarter basis, and we saw a 48% increase in the number of clinics now exhausting their initial stock from Q3 and reordering. That's roughly 720 clinics. If you see that growth continue, we would expect the majority of these clinics to have exhausted their inventory and reorder. And again, with the 70-plus percent reorder rate that we would fully expect from percentage once they kind of normalize with that. I mean it really forms a nice growth annuity as more and more patients kind of get this product. So we haven't come off of that. We're just kind of analyzing our growth rate and seeing if this continues, we feel pretty good about the majority of these clinics in the second half of the year exhausting their stock.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Stringer of Needham &amp; Company.Joseph Robert StringerNow that you're a couple of quarters into the launch, how are you thinking about potential monetization of the IV KORSUVA revenue stream? And what are some of the puts and takes that go into that decision?Christopher A. PosnerJoey, so if you are referring to the ex-U.S. royalty revenue, I think we haven't really been terribly specific about what we plan to do from a financing perspective on the nondilutive front. I mean, maybe, Ryan, do you want to say a couple of words on that?Ryan D. MaynardYes, Joe, was that your question? Was it related to ex-U.S.? Or were you talking about the U.S. revenue stream?Joseph Robert StringerIf you could comment on both, that would be helpful.Christopher A. PosnerYes. I will -- let me take one off the table. On the U.S., that wasn't our focus. We're -- from a U.S. perspective, and we get 46% of net sales essentially. And we're really in the initial quarters of this launch. And we feel there's pretty significant upside. Now, we'll have to see how CMS works itself out over the next couple of months. But where our focus has been from a financing side -- Ryan, maybe you could comment on the ex-U.S.Ryan D. MaynardSo I think we are in a good position where we do actually have an asset that is generating cash, and this is ex-U.S. We've discussed in Chris' prepared remarks how well Europe is doing and how both CSL and ourselves are very excited about the potential for Europe going forward. So we are looking at opportunities to potentially monetize that. We also discussed the potential approval of Japan in the second half of the year. That's also another potential cash-generating asset. So we've got a lot of options, and we're hopeful that we can execute on those.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni of Canaccord Genuity.Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniI have a few here. So at what point will you or your partner have a better handle on steady-state utilization of KORSUVA IV? So you get the best possible reimbursement rates post-TDAPA. Or how long do you think you would take to get to that rate?Christopher A. PosnerSo Sumant, it's a tough question because really, we're working with 1 payer, essentially, right? CMS is the dominant payer in this ecosystem in dialysis. And understanding the funding is going to be really critical that will determine the future trajectory of this drug. And the final rule will be sometime later this year, we're in the 60-day comment period. I think Scott summed it up nice, Sumant. I mean, we found the proposed rule, there's some positives there, right? I mean they are adding additional funding. And that's certainly a positive. We're certainly moving the needle with CMS to provide access to innovation and properly fund it.But we do have some serious concerns around the reimbursement methodology that Scott very clearly outlined that would have an impact on funding and potentially could be a headwind for us. So I would say, Sumant, it's a little too early to talk about the trajectory until we fully understand -- fully understand the CMS final rule and what that could mean from a funding standpoint long term. I mean, one thing that's really crystal clear to us is that there is a significant unmet need. And this drug is very effective, and it actually makes a big difference in patients' lives.So as I said before, patients at the center of everything we do. I know I can speak for my partner there in CSL Vifor with regard to KORSUVA. And our focus during this comment period is really on addressing some of these reimbursement concerns around the proposed rule that they outlined, but also, importantly, as Scott said, requesting an extension of the TDAPA period. Because we do know TDAPA's had -- has challenged some of the uptake with some physicians is, listen, I mean, their experience is with Parsabiv. And they're a little nervous that if they start patients on KORSUVA, they may have to stop them if funding is not available. So we're really focused on -- on this over these next, I would say, 60 days until CMS publishes their final rule.Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniGot it. And then given the relative difficulty of figuring out an optimal utilization rate, what do you think an optimal number of years of extension of TDAPA would you be asking for? And when would you expect to get more clarity on that, given CMS is already running a process?Christopher A. PosnerSure. Let me give that to Scott to talk about our plan with the extension.Scott M. TerrillionYes. Again, we think we have a strong argument that we should get a new TDAPA period, which is essentially 2 years. Because we need to have an amount of time where they can get the full ability to manage the utilization and get the right patient access based on what the funding is going to be. With regard to when we would hear -- we expect there's not a specific rule for how that would happen, but we would expect to hear and we would ask to hear in the November final rule, what the plan was.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of David Amsellem of Piper Sandler.David A. AmsellemSo I apologize if I missed any color here. But as you think about the cash runway and the upcoming clinical milestones, can you talk about how you're thinking about oral DFK strategically in terms of whether this is something you'd look to monetize in some way or keep it and commercialize it. I'm just trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the asset, just given the cash runway and resource constraints.Ryan D. MaynardDavid, this is Ryan. I'll start out and kind of give some color on our investment in oral difelikefalin, and then I'll pass it over to Chris to talk more about the long-term strategy for it. So the good news is that we can fully fund difelikefalin in these 3 late-stage programs, and that's critical. And that's what we actually are working on here at Cara. Obviously, CSL is running the launch for KORSUVA. But where we are spending our money, our investment is on these 3 programs. So in the guidance I gave you, those 3 programs, atopic dermatitis, chronic kidney disease and notalgia paresthetica are fully funded. I'll pass it to Chris now to talk about how we think about it.Christopher A. PosnerYes, David. I mean, we still remain very focused on developing these 2 franchises. From a commercialization standpoint, we've been very public in saying we would certainly look and we would look for ex-U.S. partners. We do not have an intention right now of commercializing ex-U.S. And I would remind you -- and I know you know this, that we own the rights to oral difelikefalin outright. So we would certainly look outside the U.S. for a partner in the U.S. Our intention is to stand up a commercial organization to maximize the potential of these products and do it alone.David A. AmsellemOkay. That's helpful. If I may sneak in one more, this is unrelated on Europe. Just remind us what pricing for the drug is. Obviously, it varies market to market. But how should we think about pricing in Europe in the big markets, at least relative to the U.S.?Christopher A. PosnerYes. I mean -- so David, you're right. I mean, it varies market to market. What I can tell you in Germany, for example, the price per vial, I believe, is around EUR 48 per vial. So kind of 1/3 of what we have in the U.S., it's probably a good way to think about it. I think where we're really encouraged in Europe is the patient population. The EU5 predominantly is not that dissimilar to the U.S. And we're seeing -- Ryan alluded to it earlier, we're seeing pretty good uptake or very good uptake actually since we launched in Germany in the fourth quarter last year in terms of both growth and patient and sales. So we're actually really encouraged what we're seeing. Reimbursement is very different. Again, you don't have a TDAPA sort of system or a cliff, so to speak, on TDAPA. And CSL has got a very good commercial footprint, executing really nicely.Operator(Operator Instructions)Again, that's Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry of Bank of America Securities.Chi Meng FongThis is Chi on for Jason. I guess, regarding the comment about you expect to hear back from CMS on any update or change in the proposal in the final ruling sometime this Fall/Winter. Can you remind us, sort of like if you do get the -- if you do or do not get the additional TDAPA. Can you help us understand, say, if you do not get the additional TDAPA, how do you think about consensus estimate doubling the sales in 2024 versus 2023?What I'm trying to get at is if the reimbursement mechanism is such that the -- CMS will look at the prior year utilizations, up by 35% here, -- I'm just trying to understand, do you dialysis standards just simply have to give up other treatments in order to make way for volume? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of the disconnect between what consensus is forecasting versus the CMS proposal. And so to the extent that you can provide that color, that would be great. And then I have a follow-up after that.Christopher A. PosnerSure, Chi. I won't comment on consensus necessarily, but I think your analysis on how this works within a capitated system is correct. If nothing's changed, the onus is on the dialysis facilities to fund the product and actually compensate for it by looking at other avenues within that bundled rate. So what we expect and what I'd say what we're doing is obviously working with CMS now in this comment period. And Scott mentioned earlier around voicing our concerns with the reimbursement methodology. We have some concerns around how they're going to calculate the additional funding. But let's be clear, there is going to be additional funding added to the bundle in their proposed rule. And when we kind of understand where CMS is going to land with that as well as the extra TDAPA period that Scott mentioned, we'll have a better sense of the trajectory of this drug, based on the ability of dialysis facilities to resource it. And that will be critical. And that will determine kind of the future of this drug.And again, we're encouraged -- I would say we're confident that we have a strong case for additional TDAPA time that Scott mentioned. We're certainly not going to handicap that at this point. I mean, we are working closely with CMS or at least providing comments to them, and we'll engage with them during this period of time.Chi Meng FongSo maybe help me understand here. So you have a 60-day comment period, and then you have this proposal coming out sometime in October, November. Is that sort of like a 2-way dialogue between you and CMS, or is it sort of more like you submit the comment, and you won't hear about anything until October, November time frame. Just help us think about sort of the level of visibility you have between now and when the final proposal comes out?Christopher A. PosnerSure. Let me give it to Scott.Scott M. TerrillionYes. So we'll be providing -- as you said, we'll be providing comments during the 60-day period. We will engage with CMS to provide more information. We would not expect to get anything back from them before the rule. They're in a comment period. They have rules they have to follow. We wouldn't expect there'd be any information back directly to us or certainly publicly before that November rule came out.Chi Meng FongOkay. Maybe just one last one for me. Can you talk about -- remind us sort of the connection between the manufacturing supply revenue on KORSUVA and the -- the revenue recognitions of IV KORSUVA. It looks like -- it looks -- the manufacturing supply revenue looks a little light this quarter. And the sequential increase in the revenue. So is it just the nature of lumpiness? Or does it like sort of like -- is there any way a leading indicator of how much IV KORSUVA, Vifor will order from Cara?Ryan D. MaynardChi, this is Ryan. Thanks for your question. I would start by saying that they're really disconnected in the short term. The commercial supply revenue is basically us shipping vials to Vifor based on the release from quality, because we're basically -- we're acting as the -- manufacturing CRO for Vifor. And as we get vials released from quality, we ship them immediately to Vifor under a PO. So there's no connection to short-term demand. And as you know, the IV KORSUVA revenue is based on shipments from Vifor to the wholesalers, and that's how we recognize revenue. So you're correct in the sense that the shipment of commercial supply revenue was down from the prior quarter, but that was simply based on the QA releases we get from our provider.OperatorThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Christopher Posner for closing remarks. Sir?Christopher A. PosnerThank you, Latif. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and I just wish everybody a great afternoon. With that, I'll end the call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(SoCalGas) has filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to support the development of a pilot project that would utilize organic waste such as chipped wood, along with nut shells, and turn it into renewable natural gas (RNG).If approved, the project would be the largest RNG project in the state of California, producing up to 4.5 billion cubic feet of fuel each year from 400,000 to 500,000 tons of agricultural waste, some of which would otherwise be burned. It would more than double already historic deliveries of RNG in 2022 from existing projects within SoCalGas's service territory and could deliver carbon-neutral or negative fuel equivalent to taking up to 52,000 gasoline vehicles off the road each year.The project would be developed by San Joaquin Renewables LLC in the City of McFarland. Pursuant to CPUC direction, SoCalGas proposed funding its portion of the project – about $13 million – with cap-and-trade funds. If approved, which could come as soon as May 2024, the project is planned to come online in late 2026.""As the State of California has recognized, renewable natural gas remains a critical tool, along with other decarbonization pathways such as electrification, hydrogen and carbon management, in our efforts to decarbonize our great state,"" said Neil Navin, Chief Clean Fuels Officer at SoCalGas.  ""Instead of burning this agricultural waste, this project could produce more RNG annually than the entire state of Hawaii uses each year, putting this waste to good use to help shore up energy reliability and resiliency as we transition to a clean energy economy.""""Converting biomass into renewable natural gas provides a sustainable and renewable source of energy from waste material,"" said T.J. Paskach, President of San Joaquin Renewables.  ""Additionally, the San Joaquin Renewables facility will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, will help clean the air of the Central Valley by producing a carbon negative fuel, and will provide hundreds of high-quality jobs in McFarland.""Story continuesThe project will work by using a non-combustion process to turn agricultural waste into a mixture of gases, including hydrogen. The mixture is then cleaned, compressed and is then usable as RNG.In February 2022, the CPUC adopted the Renewable Gas Procurement Standard, which sets goals for the procurement of renewable gas made by capturing methane emitted by organic waste from wastewater treatment plants, dairies, landfills, agricultural waste, and forestry residues. The standard also requires SoCalGas to replace approximately 12.2 percent of the traditional gas it delivers to core customers with renewable natural gas by 2030. The CPUC also required SoCalGas to submit an application proposing at least one gasification or pyrolysis pilot project focused on conversion of woody biomass to biomethane.RNG is a key tool in decarbonizing the gas system as it can be carbon neutral or even negative, depending on its source. RNG, along with carbon management and clean fuels like hydrogen, is one in a suite of tools SoCalGas is utilizing to help achieve its aim to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.More information about SoCalGas' renewable natural gas efforts can be found here: https://socalgas.com/rng.About SoCalGas Headquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

Six weeks prior to the marathon, their goal took on new meaning when a dear colleague, Jeroen Breen, sadly passed away from brain disease. Employees laced up their shoes and raised over 11,000 EUR to honor his memory. Richard Roudeix, LyondellBasell president, Europe, Asia, Middle East &amp; International Ventures, said, ""Participating in the marathon to help advance brain tumor research will be one of the best ways for us to pay tribute to Jeroen. He will be greatly missed."" The funds from The NM Rotterdam Marathon will help support more effective treatments for brain tumors at the Erasmus Medical Center, one of the most reputable institutions in clinical medicine in Europe.Elsewhere, LyondellBasell employees in Texas got on their bikes to raise funds for lifesaving programs and research to find a cure for multiple sclerosis (MS).

LyondellBasell matched these donations 2:1 totaling more than $280,000, bringing the total amount given to the emergency response efforts, from the company, to half a million dollars.LyondellBasell, Channelview Fire Department in Channelview, Texas, and Memorial Hermann Life Flight in Houston launched a new pre-hospital whole blood program to address severe blood loss in emergency settings. Funded by a $10,000 grant from LyondellBasell and modeled after Memorial Hermann Life Flight's Pre-hospital Blood Product Administration Program, the Channelview Fire Department now carries one unit of o-positive whole blood for patients that experience any medical or trauma-related condition resulting in uncontrolled hemorrhage.""Our emergency responders are critical to our communities, and vital within our operations at LyondellBasell,"" said Tony Wood, LyondellBasell Channelview Complex site manager. ""We are honored to support the whole blood program and grateful for the sacrifices and relentless efforts our first responders make every day; they are true heroes to our community."" Patients can receive the first unit of whole blood from the Channelview Fire Department and in conjunction with Memorial Hermann Life Flight, be transported to the Texas Medical Center via helicopter in preparation for a higher level of care if needed. ""It's been a great privilege to help Channelview Fire Department launch their whole blood program,"" said Rudy Cabrera, Chief Flight Nurse of Memorial Hermann Life Flight. ""Not only does the program benefit patients tremendously in the pre-hospital setting, but furthers to serve the community and those in need.""ADVANCING OUR PLANET: PROMOTING A BEAUTIFUL AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTIn keeping with the 2022 Earth Day theme, ""Invest In Our Planet,"" LyondellBasell focused its Earth Day activities on meaningful action. The company's aim was to help protect the environment and make progress toward our goal of planting and distributing 6,000 trees across the greater Houston area by the end of 2022. In May, together with Trees For Houston and the Astros Foundation, LyondellBasell young professionals employee network (YPEN) members and Houston Astros pitcher Framber Valdez, gave away 2,500 trees. In October, employees, friends and family from five Houston-area LyondellBasell locations gave away another 2,500 trees in celebration of our annual global day of service, Global Care Day, at the LyondellBasell Center for Petrochemical, Energy and Technology at San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Texas, and planted an additional 900 trees at Herman Brown Park. These two events along with additional planting projects at San Jacinto College achieved the 6,000 tree goal.Also in October, 11 LyondellBasell employees in India volunteered their time to clean up an area at Fort Raigad, a historic hill standing 4,400 feet (1,356 meters) above sea level. Thanks to their efforts, 35 kg of bottles, straws, bags, cups, lids, wrappers, plastic cutlery and many other plastic items were cleared along the path.ADVANCING TOMORROW'S WORKFORCE: MEET CHAKEITHALyondellBasell invests in training opportunities for the next generation of workers. For many years, our company has been involved in vocational office education programs (VOE) with local high schools. With years and time invested, we know that many high school students are unaware of the career opportunities our industry provides.

During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3. During today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance. Safety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success. Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars: grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress. Let me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapid progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes. In grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy. In May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. Now let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030. Through multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, [indiscernible] sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [Devon] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas: technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional health will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions. We're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling. In line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers. Most importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society. On Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually. Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce. When we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023. Let's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue. Modest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years. At our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000. In addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons. One of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process. The value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results. Let's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $500 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects. With the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery. In the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&amp;P margins and higher I&amp;D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Ken Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&amp;P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins. In the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy. On June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&amp;P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million. Looking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions. Having said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower. In line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&amp;D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. In the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins. In the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman: Thank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter. We expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our number 1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design. One KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results. In early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is stopped and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022. In China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low. Building and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to be part of the infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act. Demand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low. At LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle. Now let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&amp;P businesses moderately improved amid tipid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. Cash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teens to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies. At our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement around our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce, from frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. We're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions. See also 25 Most Health-Conscious States in the US and 10 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Just taking a step back on Slide 14. You had a pretty solid 2Q in the Americas. But at the same time, as you've been consistently highlighting, there's been a lot of volatility in NGL pricing, there's going to be a difference in operating rates in the second half. There's a little bit of a choppy macro picture. Just when we're thinking about integrated olefin margins, just how should we be thinking about the run rate for the second half and in 2024, just want to take a look at the current dynamics? And then any comments on how you expect this to eventually inflect and improve, hopefully, next year. Ken Lane: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Like we have said in the remarks that we made, we do expect it to be volatile. So the good news is we've seen NGL prices come down. NAV was really peaking in July, but we do see that coming off here in August, but it did have an impact in July. That's not going to continue. The inventory levels for NGLs are still very healthy and production is growing. So overall, we expect that we're going to see advantages with NGL production here in the U.S., especially with ethane. Now having said that, we still do have a lot of new supply that's coming into the market. And at the end of the second quarter, we saw prices in the Americas coming down and that's going to continue into the third quarter, let's say, it's going to carry into the third quarter. We've seen some green shoots in the export market. So I think we're kind of bouncing along the bottom here. But it's just going to support that theme of continued volatility going forward. What I would expect is that we're going to see that normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, some weakness on volumes. Q1 will typically be a little bit better. And then when we get into the second half of next year is when I expect to start to see things really improve. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Question around the export split versus sales in North America. So if you would -- maybe 3 parts. So where are you guys on that split? Where do you think the U.S. industry is and then when you think about the 3 plants that are going to start up or are in the process of starting up, where do you think their split will be in their first year of operations? Peter Vanacker: That's a very good question, Duffy. Let me hand it over to Ken on the olefins and polyolefins side. Ken Lane: Duffy. Yes, so listen, we have traditionally been lower in terms of a percentage for exports in our portfolio, and you see that this year. Now some of that as well is driven by the turnaround that we've had in the first half of the year. We've got some of our capacity down right now in the Midwest. So we've been a little bit lower on the export sales in the first half of the year. As an industry, the Americas or the U.S. typically is exporting somewhere around 35% to 40% of the capacity. Normally, when these new assets come online, you're looking at them exporting significantly above that level for the first year or so as they work their way into the market. But I don't see any change in the midterm around the industry being at that 40% level of exports, but it's always our goal to find the highest value for our products. And that is in the domestic market. So our focus is on serving the customers here and building out a portfolio that is more resilient by supplying domestic. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. Is e-cracker concept that you're pursuing, is that fair to assume that this would require a complete rebuild and not a retrofit. And if so, how do you look at the economics of that approach versus these multiple hydros that you have at your refinery that you could produce renewable map, particularly if the DOE goes along with your hydrogen hub proposal.Peter Vanacker: Thank you, Steve. Very good question that you're asking. I mean what we are doing here together with our partners is, first of all, developing the technology further into, let's call it, a semi industrial scale. So this is not replacing, but it is feeding into a cracker. Next to that, of course, we are following different other avenues in order to prepare ourselves, I mean, for more renewable hydrocarbons. And here, that's what we are looking at, at the refinery and how can we leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have. So there will not be one solution fits all is the key message, but we are playing, let's say, very broadly, being technology agnostic, and investing in the different types of technologies that eventually where we then would decide to invest in those technologies on an industrial scale. We're talking about 2013 plus in my view. Then, of course, there can be different solutions depending on where you are in the world. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Steve Richardson : I was wondering if you could ask on APS, Torkel. I appreciate the update. I was wondering if you could maybe remind us of some of your longer-term goals in terms of restoring profitability. It sounds like you're making some good inroads. And then also I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more if acquisitions should be expected to be persistent part of the outlook there or if this is something unique. Torkel Rhenman: Thank you. So as we communicated, our target is to get the business to what we believe is very feasible that the $0.5 billion earnings by 2027. And that's the plan that we have embarked on. And I have to say we are at the current moment right as I expect us to be. I've led multiple business transformations, and this is where I expect us to be at this time. So if you look at our earnings performance, I think fourth quarter of last year was the bottom, and we have then 2 months behind us where we are gradually improving it, but it is a multi-year effort for us and we're feeling the growth pipeline, as I mentioned, is our number 1 priority, and we're making good progress, but that also takes time. But it is our focus. In terms of acquisitions, the Mepol, I think, was an acquisition that perfectly fit in, but there is nothing else that we have that we are in that sort of category for our space at the moment. Peter Vanacker: And here -- it's Peter. I mean just to add to that, I mean, in terms of the acquisitions, I mean, one needs to look at the Mepol acquisition, being at the boundary, the interface between circular and low-carbon solutions and then the APS business with the compounding. So Mepol has a very strong mechanical recycling position in those different markets, and that's what made it so attractive for us to do that acquisition. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to follow up on your outlook for O&amp;P margins across both North America and EIA. So it calls -- it looks like you're calling for double-digit declines in your profitability in Q3 sequentially from Q2. Can you just walk us through some of those mechanics? I know that we had the $0.03 decline in June on polyethylene. Are you looking for further declines in Q3? And just wondering, given the feedstock volatility there as well and then the recent decline in ethane prices, or is it continued weakness in volume? Or is it a little bit of both? Or maybe just walk us through some of the tanks. Peter Vanacker: Yes. Maybe first of all, let me repeat what has been said in the prepared remarks is that we have an outlook, I mean, for Q3, which we believe will be mid mid-double digits, so mid-teens to mid-20s, lower in terms of EBITDA compared to [indiscernible] Q2. And why that relatively broad range still because as you know, I mean, we have a very broad portfolio of different products. And we've seen a bit of improvements in the refinery markets. On the one hand side, we continue to believe, I mean, that we will have strong oxyfuel margins as Kim mentioned in the prepared remarks. But then, of course, I mean, with the volatility that you see in the olefins and polyolefins markets and then China still not being back as it should be at this point in time right now. So we will then, of course, fine-tune that towards more at the end of the quarter. When you Michael will speak on a conference, and then we'll give a further update on where we are standing, I mean, in that quarter. So with that, I mean, on the O&amp;P maybe answer that question as well. I mean, Ken, if you can give some additional? Ken Lane: Yes, like I had said previously, we're looking at the feedstock kind of peaked in July. So that definitely is going to hurt us versus Q2, if you think about it sequentially. Also, like I said, with prices coming down in the U.S. at the end of Q2, that's carried into Q3, so both of those are going to be headwinds. Then there is some volume component to that. Q2 is normally our peak fall in terms of seasonality and in Q3, especially in Europe, in the summer months, you start to see the volume slow down. So we will have some volume slowdown in Q3 as well. Overall, I expect that we are, like I said, bumping along here on margins in Q3 in terms of being at the bottom.Michael McMurray : And then what I would remind investors is that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally weak to the third. Just as a reminder. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Government in China recently included the plastics industry, specifically in their economic support program, just very recently. Do you have any insight into how the support actually is implemented in practice. It sounds like you haven't seen much benefit so far. But -- just any color on specific program maybe that you have would be helpful -- Peter Vanacker: Yes, Aleksey, I mean, we have seen a couple of areas where that eventually could have an impact. But at this point in time, it's too premature to say, I mean how much that impact will be. Our people, as you know, they are on the ground, I mean, following that. There seems to talks around, I mean, automotive industry, talks about white goods industry, but too premature, I mean, to say because we need -- we've seen a couple of these initiatives so far, but we are rather in a wait-and-see position now and ready. I mean, if the market would see, I mean, an uptick because all the initiatives so far have not had the impact as we would have hoped despite the fact, I mean, that the saving rates of individuals is extremely high, I mean, in China. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : I had a question on I&amp;D. You noted in your slide that you're anticipating a $20 million headwind in 3Q from turnarounds, but also you indicated that you're shutting down 2 PO/SM plants for both the months of July and August, I assume that that's not included in that guide. So I'm just curious what sort of financial impact we should be anticipating with the shutdowns of the PO/SM facilities and are you awaiting a return in demand before you bring those facilities back up? Any more color there would be very helpful. Peter Vanacker: Yes. Very good question, Frank. And of course, I mean, like we have done last year as well. We don't call this, let's say, cost savings, but I mean, we call this, I mean, we look at what is happening in the marketplace. You know that with our PO/TBA capacities and especially the new one that we have rather seen successfully. We have the lowest cost and also lowest carbon footprints, propylene upsides in the world. So it's clear, I mean, that the PO/SM facilities are more kind of playing a role of a swing capacity. So with that, I will hand over to Kim to give more details. KimFoley : Frank. Thank you, Peter. Let me just add a little bit more color, as Peter alluded to, when we provide the guidance, the guidance was really to help investors understand the difference of bringing on this new PO/TBA capacity and relative to the other capacity that we would be taking offline for maintenance. And we really looked at that from the PO/TBA technology. So that you can see both the PO impacts as well as the oxyfuel impacts because they're almost offsetting, which is what you see in the guidelines. We talked about a 50% run rate for the new plant versus the maintenance of the other assets. So when you ask about what's the impact of the PO/SM market or assets going down, I think the way to think about it is where is styrene today. Styrene is oversupplied, it's changing month-to-month on very, very thin margins. So what -- how I would answer your question, Frank, is I don't think there is an impact based on PO demand of those plants idling at this point in time based on the durable demand for polyurethanes regionally as well as globally. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Question within your wide range of EBITDA guidance, you have sort of a single point targets for operating rates. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about operating rates given they fluctuated a fair amount a lot more than normal over the past 12 months. And so what are you solving for with those operating rates versus the profitability you're seeing? Michael McMurray : It's pretty simple, Vincent. We're matching supply to demand. I wouldn't say it any other way.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Mike Leithead : Question on O&amp;P EAI. Historically, if I look back, this business did about $1 billion or more of annual EBITDA. And now it seems like profitability is likely going to be a bit below that for some time, just given energy dynamics and some of the new supply that's coming on in Asia. So just if we take a step back, how are you thinking long term about the competitiveness and profitability of your assets there? Peter Vanacker: Yes, Ken, I mean, if you can take that question? Ken Lane: Yes. So listen, of course, the headwinds in the European business with energy like everybody else has. And we're focused on generating the highest value from those assets because there are things that we can do through our VEP program that still does generate good value from a margin standpoint. We've seen probably the biggest headwind in Europe around demand. So volume is down pretty significantly year-over-year. As you can imagine, the whole inflation equation has hit the consumer very hard in Europe. So we believe we've got good competitive assets there. But of course, we're operating at a very difficult market. We're going to look for ways to continue to improve the value that we can get from those assets. In the longer term, we're always looking at our portfolio, and we'll continue to do so and make sure that we have the most competitive position that we can with reasonable amounts of capital that we would have to deploy there. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Matthew Blair : I had a question on just the longer-term PE outlook. Some of the consultants are showing global capacity growth in about the 2.5% range for 2024 through 2026, which, as you know, is about half of what we've seen recently. And so my question is, do you -- what are your expectations? Do you believe this forecast? Do you think this number will creep up? Or is it too late to really see any meaningful increase in like the 2024 and 2025 numbers, specifically. Peter Vanacker: Well, Matthew, I mean, normally, you have quite a good visibility. I mean, with the announcements of capacity increases. So -- and that visibility in our industry is normally around what, 4, 5 years, I mean, down the road. I would be very surprised, I mean, if there would certainly be additional capacities that come on stream. I mean, within that period that have not been announced because that's not how the industry is working. I mean, Ken, with regards, I mean, to the announcements now as the supply and demand. Ken Lane: I -- the only thing I would add to that, Peter, is we have seen some projects starting to slow down, right? So we are hearing about that in the market. And look, I'll remind you, too, we always get into these down cycles, and it happens every time. And it feels like you're going to be here forever but there will be capacity that also comes out of the market. So yes, there are some additions that are going to come. And some of those are going to make sense depending on their feedstock position and the region that they're in, but there are going to be some capacities that come out. It takes a couple of years for that to happen, but that's how the cycle works. So in the short term, I don't expect there to be any significant change in capacity coming on. But in the midterm, I do think you're going to see some projects start to be slowed down. Peter Vanacker: And then if you look at it, I mean, from the demand side, if you look into the history, than with the financial crisis 2008 and 2009, then certainly in 2009 and 2010, you had a big recovery. So growth was higher than it normally is, let's say, over the cycle, let's say, around, I mean, 4% per year. And the same we've seen, I mean also with the pandemic, I mean, pandemic in 2021. During the second year, you saw a recovery with -- when you compare that to 2020. So I mean, we continue to be just looking, I mean, from a historic point of view. We have a consumer behavior. It could very well be that also then we see in the future that there's going to be higher demand compared to, I mean, to the average over the cycle demand growth of about 4% per year on polyethylene. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Will the delay in closing the refinery pushback the time frame to achieve the $1 billion EBITDA from circular plastics? I assume you're going to be later in converting some of the gasifiers and so forth at the location. Peter Vanacker: The clear answer on that is, John, no. It's not. I mean, our target remains, I mean unchanged in the circular and low-carbon solutions business as we have communicated on the Capital Markets Day and we have been evaluating that option, obviously, exactly if you did our Capital Markets Day, so it was on the radar screen. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.Jeff Zekauskas : I think a couple of years ago, in Advanced Polymer Solutions, you were earning about $300 million. And today, guess the quarterly run rate is about $1 billion, and maybe you're making $10 million in EBIT. What happened to that business? And in your forecast of $500 million in EBITDA from circular polymers, what EBITDA margin do you expect on that? Or what EBITDA margin does that number still -- Torkel Rhenman: Thank you for the question. On the APS, I covered when we had the Capital Markets Day, I think we've really lost the focus on the business and our customers when we went through the integration. And we took out a lot of cost and synergy but this is a business that really requires this customer centricity. It's a project-based business. You have to have a really good growth pipeline and a very, very good service level and that's the recognition that I think from the whole integration that we made some mistakes and we really have not put together this transformation plan to deliver what this business can perform. And that's the journey that we're on. And I'm confident that we're going to deliver on it. We're making good progress. But it is a transformation, it will take up years. Michael McMurray : And then Jeff, it's Michael. One of the things that I'd add, if you're looking at current year results versus historic results, remember, at the start of this year, we removed 2 relatively significant businesses from the APS segment and put it back in O&amp;P. So that's not an apples-to-apples comparison if you're looking at this year versus history, just as a reminder. Peter Vanacker: And to your question, I mean, on the circular business, Jeff. I mean the $500 million in -- by 2027 and then the $1 billion by 2030. When we talked about that on the Capital Markets Day, you know that we are talking about 2 million tons of target by 2030. The margins that we talked about, I mean, you can do the back of the [indiscernible] Calculation pretty much is incremental EBITDA on top of the EBITDA that we normally make, I mean, in our crackers. So it gives you a bit of guidance also here. I must say, I mean we're -- we look at the margins that we are creating, I mean, today with that business, you know that since we started the business, we have been able, I mean, to grow the business quite substantially. Of course, albeit, I mean, still at a low level compared to the overall volumes that we are having in the polyolefins. We see that the margins that we can capture or substantially higher than what we have said, I mean, at the Capital Markets Day. And again, it's a separate business that is being created. I keep repeating that. Like I said at the Capital Markets Day, with its own supply and demand that has its own value-based pricing mechanisms that we are positioning in the marketplace. So this is not a market where you have a polyolefin plus a premium type of approach. Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Just wanted to revisit the earlier question around polyethylene exports out of the U.S. Look, I mean, a lot of this capacity that's been coming online in the U.S. has been with an eye to the export markets. And as you guys and others have talked about, the European market isn't looking great. Asia hasn't rebounded the way one would have expected it to. So I mean, are you seeing a scenario where some of that product that was meant for the export market isn't making its way to the export markets and potentially is putting further downward pressure on PE pricing in the U.S.? Peter Vanacker: One of the things, Hassan, that we have seen already since the end of last year, and this has maybe also a bit to do, I mean, with some learnings out of running a business like that in a pandemic environment, is that there has been substantially more disciplined in the marketplace. So just like we, as a leader in the industry, have reduced, I mean, the output instead of pushing products into the market. Others have done, I mean, the same thing. So you see a change, in my view, in terms of behavior compared, I mean, to the history. Ken, anything you want to add?Ken Lane: I completely agree with that. And like I had mentioned before, there will be headwinds with this capacity coming on. There always is. But the capacity comes on one time and then you feel it and the market will adjust to that. I also said earlier, we're seeing some strength in some of the export markets, especially going south. So we're starting to see some growth in some markets like Brazil that's going to help absorb some of that capacity. So I'm not any more concerned about it now than I was 6 months ago. Southeast Asia is even looking a little bit better. We've seen that trend over the last couple of months. So the markets are going to absorb it over time. And like Peter said and Michael had said, we'll adjust our operating rates to optimize cash. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Okay. Thank you very much. As usual, very thoughtful questions. We're looking forward to sharing the updates on our progress towards unlocking additional value, of course, over the coming months and we wish you all a great weekend. And as usual, stay safe. Thank you very much. Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

But on June 28, the REIT and Regal Cinemas allayed some fears by entering into a restructuring agreement and new master lease before its parent Cineworld's bankruptcy resolution. The new master lease will be on 31 of the 57 theaters that Regal leases.Under the terms of the agreement, the theaters will have triple-net leases with $65 million in total annual fixed rent and will escalate by 10% every five years.

Despite elevated interest rates and ongoing inflation, the S&amp;P 500 is up for the fifth consecutive month. The index returned a solid 20% since January, and the breathless cries of “imminent recession” are mostly whispers now. We’re now left looking at increased bargain stock opportunities because the previous panic is subsiding. Still, overall market volatility left a handful of stocks trading at a steep discount. Less affected by the sharp reversal, these stocks are down 10% or more this year. This imbalance creates a unique opportunity for savvy investors hunting for potential bargains. Although suppressed share prices often indicate underlying issues, these companies exhibit solid fundamentals, promising prospects and potential for recovery, making them attractive options for most investment portfolios. Whether you’re a value investor looking for an undervalued gem or a contrarian willing to go against the market grain, these three stocks should be on your radar for the rest of the year. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsQuest Diagnostics  (DGX)Quest Diagnostics Patient Service Center in San Francisco Bay AreaSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comQuest Diagnostics  (NYSE:DGX), the healthcare mainstay offering independent diagnostic testing, is struggling to hit analyst expectations post-pandemic. The company recently reported an earnings drop, mostly driven by “faster than expected declines in Covid-19 revenues,” according to the company CEO. Still, Quest’s core operational base remains strong and revenue from those business sectors is up 10%.Ultimately, Quest’s core business is on a solid path to recovery. The company’s executives predict a steady 2% revenue growth through 2024, while its expanded testing toolkit integrating cutting-edge AI features helps maintain its competitive position. Ultimately, the American healthcare landscape has a profitable forecast. A recent McKinsey report indicated a 4% combined annual growth rate through 2026, although increased provider costs may cut into hospital and specialty care center profits. This bodes well for Quest, as many of these providers, looking to streamline operations and cap internal costs, will outsource diagnostics to third-party providers. Story continuesQuest has a long road ahead despite an optimistic outlook. Still, this year’s stock price beatdown is undeserved. The firm should see a healthy bounce back and become an optimal choice of bargain stock opportunities, as its core operations pick up the post-Covid-19 slack.American Tower Corp (AMT)American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockCell tower and data center REIT American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) is having a rough year, largely because telecom mergers reduced the company’s American customer pool. At the same time, the company’s been shedding unprofitable overseas operational assets, including those in India. But both these factors are a positive sign for AMT’s prospects. They indicate a renewed focus on what matters for the real estate giant: a focus on expanding core connectivity. This focus will serve the REIT well as the global Internet of Things paradigm accelerates.Analysts agree, sticking the stock with a strong “Buy” consensus and pegging the REIT’s fair value at $220 per share – indicating a significant upside from today’s pricing. BMO Capital, who began coverage of the company in July, is representative of overall analyst expectations moving forward. BMO expects as much as 25% upside from current pricing, projecting nearly 4% revenue growth for future periods. AMT investors waiting for the reversal can also enjoy the company’s substantial dividend yield. The company currently distributes $6.28 annually, a more than 3% yield. That yield may be lower than many fixed-income investment options. Still, investors can capitalize on the yield through dividend reinvestment to continue building a position in the REIT. With reinvestment, keen investors can keep their cost basis low while they await the company’s bounce back.General Dynamics (GD)image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocksSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comDefense giant General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) had a tough year as they’ve struggled to adapt to stretched supply chains that feed the development of their weapons and aerospace manufacturing sectors. But, today, they’ve mostly managed to reorient themselves to a changing global landscape. Likewise, recent reports indicate a hefty upside for the company, making them one of the ideal bargain stock opportunities.At the end of July, management issued increased revenue forecasts driven by increased demand for private jets and military equipment demand. The company’s improved forecast is backed by performance. The recent $2.70 earnings per share beat analyst estimates by a solid 6%. Sales are also up across the board. The company reported $2.5 billion in new aerospace sales last quarter and a 15% increase in marine sales demand.Ultimately, while strained supply lines present a continued challenge for the company through 2023, analysts commend the company for being “an extraordinarily well-run and financially disciplined company.” In an industry where many struggle with slim profit margins, GD’s double-digit margins and consistent profitability shouldn’t be ignored. As the world continues returning to normal and adapting to supply shifts, this dividend aristocrat stock is poised for substantial upside growth.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

He’s now calling it “X” and plans to turn the social media platform into a super app where you can do just about everything.“In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird,” Musk stated in a July 24 post.Time will tell if the eccentric billionaire made the right call.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn the meantime, it’s important to note that corporate rebranding is risky because you potentially alienate your core customer. Twitter/X is already losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Alienating customers further would be a death sentence for the social media platform.However, the impact of rebranding on stocks can be positive for shareholders. Investopedia pointed out that in 2007 Steve Jobs changed the name of the iPhone maker from Apple Computers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reflect that the company was more than just computers. Oh, how right he was.Here are three companies that ought to be following Musk’s lead.Gap (GPS)A close-up view of a Gap (GPS) sign in the window of a Los Angeles, California mall.Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.comI can name at least three companies that have changed their corporate name to reflect the diversity of their holdings: Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), and Driven Brand Holdings (NASDAQ:DRVN). They haven’t suffered by changing their name to reflect their multi-brand status.Yet, Gap (NYSE:GPS) continues to go by its legacy brand, even though other brands in the company are better growth vehicles. Rather than continue to remind investors how much of a disaster the Gap brand has become, it should create a name that implies a future with authentic growth brands.That’s it: Retail Growth Brands Inc., or RGB, just like the late, great Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.How bad has it gotten at the Gap group of companies?Story continuesThey replaced former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sonya Syngal with Richard Dickson, the former president and CEO of Mattel (NYSE:MAT) and the man behind Barbie’s revival. At Athleta, its once-promising athleisure brand, it hired Chris Blakeslee, the former president of Alo Yoga.Given how many women work at the four major Gap brands, it’s beyond crazy the board couldn’t find a qualified woman to lead the entire company.That tells you all you need to know about the dysfunction at Gap. No wonder it’s traded under $20 for the past 20 months.Rollins (ROL)pest control spray ROL stock dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockRollins (NYSE:ROL) is a company I’ve recommended to readers over the past few years. In 2016, I included the pest control company in a group of 10 stocks I thought every retirement portfolio should have.“Over the long haul, it hasn’t disappointed delivering 18 consecutive years of earnings growth and 14 consecutive years of dividend increases averaging 12%,” I wrote in May of that year.The stock is up around 235% in the years since. However, its stock’s become much more volatile since the pandemic started in early 2020. Year-to-date, it’s up 11.7%, trailing the S&amp;P 500 by over 800 basis points. One thing to remember about that lack of performance: Most of the index’s gains are from the “Magnificent 7,” the tech stocks all benefiting from artificial intelligence.Take out the Mag 7, and Rollins’ returns look just fine.On July 26, the company reported healthy top and bottom line growth. Its revenues were $821 million, 14.9% higher than a year earlier. Excluding acquisitions, its revenues were up 7.7% year-over-year. In terms of net income, it earned $114 million on an adjusted basis, 12.2% higher than Q2 2022.With industry-leading brand names such as Orkin and Critter Control, the Rollins name says little about those businesses.GameStop (GME)GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning lightSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisualsGameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are two meme stocks that I will not recommend to any investors. They are ridiculously overvalued and represent everything bad about the current investment environment.However, I don’t have a problem recommending that the video game retailer rebrand to something other than GameStop. This legacy name is like a chain around its neck, constantly dragging it down. Serious investors will continue to keep it off their watchlists.It doesn’t help that the Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder and GameStop savior, Ryan Cohen, keeps mowing through senior management. CEO Matt Furlong was shown the door in June after two years in the top job. On July 27, former chief financial officer (CFO) Diana Saadeh-Jajeh resigned after just a year.GamesIndustry.biz managing editor Brendan Sinclair wrote a scathing piece about GameStop in June. If you’ve got any thoughts on buying GME stock, do yourself a favor and read his article. It’s spot on.Sinclair’s strongest point is that the company has known for years that its days selling video games through brick-and-mortar stores were done. Digital was the only way. Yet, it continues to sputter on that front.“But the idea that Cohen has a brilliant plan to fix everything in one fell swoop is simply not credible. He’s essentially been in charge for years now, the fundamental business is still the same, and the user experience online or in-store is not meaningfully better. Bafflingly, it may actually be worse.” Sinclair wrote on June 9.With $1.3 billion in cash on its balance sheet, it’s got plenty to do a full-scale rebrand. Unfortunately, as Sinclair pointed out, it’s likely far too late.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cisco Systems:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$15b ÷ (US$98b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 9.1%. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Cisco Systems' ROCE Trending?Cisco Systems has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 44% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Cisco Systems has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 41% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon.Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.Video Transcript- Well, as the earnings season approached, many cast a wary eye on tech. The sector's been propping up the market. And given the unstable economic environment, investors have been using it to judge the health of the economy. And the majority of the so-called Magnificent Seven have all been able to beat Wall Street expectations. All have done well this earnings season.So let's bring in Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan to discuss more. Good to have you on the show, Daniel.DANIEL MORGAN: Hi, Rachelle.- So give us this breakdown of-- good to see you-- of how tech has been faring. Because obviously this initial rally started with tech. But where are we now when we factor in the earnings season?DANIEL MORGAN: What's interesting, Rachelle, as you mentioned in the beginning of the conversation, the bar for the tech sector coming into this second quarter was really low. But I will have to say that I was very pleased with the way that a lot of these earnings reports go. I mean, if we just kind of kick off and we look at online ad spend rates with Meta and Google a couple of weeks ago, the expectations were they would be flat to negative. And both those companies reported an increase in revenue. So Meta was up 11%, Google was up about 3.5% in their ad revenues.Story continuesAnd that kind of worked itself through the reports. Amazon kind of capped things off with a very good report with revenues up 11%. And then we had Apple, which was kind of a mixed review. We knew that smartphone unit volumes were going to be very muted going into the second quarter. But overall, their guidance that they gave for the upcoming third quarter was very strong in regards to services and iPhones.So I think overall, we'd have to take-- a takeaway from this, Rachelle, that is that numbers came in better than expected. We had a very low bar. Can we make up for these huge runs that we've had in these stocks, though? Right, Rachelle, coming into these reports. And I think that's where investors are pondering right now.- And of these Magnificent Seven, who was the most underwhelming for you? Especially when you factored in some of the guidance and the softness that we saw.DANIEL MORGAN: Microsoft was somewhat muted. Apple was somewhat muted. Those would be the two that kind of stood out at least at this point, to me, that were good numbers. They weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create like a catalyst or surprise, like we saw with Google, Meta, and let's say Amazon. So those two kind of stick in my mind.- And as we look at, of course, the chip space, NVIDIA riding high and enjoying those gains on that generative AI push that kept popping up in everybody's earnings call. But what about some of the other chipmakers? Who are you following there? And any surprises there?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, there's other stocks in that group, Rachelle, that could turn out to take some sort of not leadership role, but market share in the AI space. If you look at-- just to name a few, Marvel Technologies has their DSP chip called PAM, which is somewhat exciting. You have Broadcom, which has their Jericho3 chip. Now these are all chips that are just being rolled out that are in that same space that can compete directly against NVIDIA.We also know that Intel has their Falcon Shores chip that's going to come out next year. AMD, which reported last week, has their MI300, which is a AI chip that's being promoted as something that's going to compete directly against NVIDIA. So there are other companies in that space. We're going to be rolling into NVIDIA, Rachelle. About two weeks from now, we're going to get numbers from then mid week.But those are some of the reports that have kind of rolled in. Qualcomm has their AI 100 they reported last week also. So but that's still in an infancy stage. Rachelle, as we know, we haven't had a lot of tangible evidence that AI has actually directly impacted the financials of these companies. NVIDIA's really the only company that's actually shown tangible evidence of strength in terms of their AI chips.- And of course, a lot of these markets, these big tech names, also have a lot of exposure to China as well. And we're seeing some softness there in terms of demand. What are some of the stories that you're looking at coming out of China that you think we should be really keeping an eye on when it comes to big tech and where valuations then go from here?DANIEL MORGAN: You're right, Rachelle. I mean, Qualcomm gets about 60% of their revenues coming out of China. And China's head of the double sword, right? You have not only the impacts of them coming off of COVID lockdowns and how overall demand for, let's say, smartphones are coming. We know that when Apple reported numbers last week, their overall demand for smartphones in China was actually much stronger than people considered. It was actually positive where people thought it was negative.And then you also have this issue with regulators in terms of these back and forth of China no longer allowing certain chips that are produced by US companies to come into their country and vice versa. So China has got a lot of moving parts not only from the overall growth of their economy and demand for different electronics, but also in terms of what's going to happen from a regulatory perspective. How is that going to impact various companies?We already know there was news out a couple weeks ago about Micron. We know that NVIDIA-- those are companies that China has isolated as being not allowed to bring chips into their country, various chips that they make. So a lot of things coming out of China, a lot of things to follow.- And in terms of companies that you're going to be keeping an eye on as we continue through the thick of the earnings season, what are some of the bellwether stocks that are going to give us a better idea of how the consumer is feeling and how looking at things like business CapEx and what-- how companies are choosing to invest based on this macroeconomic environment?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, Rachelle, we have Cisco next week. So that's going to give us a good idea of what's going on in terms of CapEx, in terms of networking. The following week, we have Snowflake, we have NVIDIA. So those are some big numbers that are going to be coming out. Snowflake, as you know, is a middleware company and the data center space. They make the tools and software that allow you to pull data off of the big data centers.Obviously, NVIDIA, which we've already talked about in terms of AI. We also have Applied Materials reporting next week. They'll give us a good idea of how CapEx budgets are going in terms of companies spending on semiconductor equipment. And that gives us an idea of what the demand is in that space.So we still have a lot of big numbers coming out here. We also have Salesforce, which is a big play on the software as a service in terms of the enterprise. So we have more to go than just the so-called FAANG stocks or Magnificent Seven that have mostly reported up at this point. So we'll obviously be checking in here over the next couple of weeks on those numbers.- We appreciate you getting us up to speed on all of that and for joining us with your insights.DANIEL MORGAN: Thank you, Rachelle.- Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan. Good to see you.]"
