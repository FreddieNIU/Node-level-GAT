FNDA has been able to amass assets over $5.97 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Value. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDA, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesFNDA's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.46%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.FNDA's heaviest allocation is in the Industrials sector, which is about 19% of the portfolio. Its Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG) accounts for about 0.46% of the fund's total assets, followed by First Citizens Bancshares Inc Clas (FCNCA) and Patterson Uti Energy Inc (PTEN).FNDA's top 10 holdings account for about 3.42% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -10.91% so far this year and is down about -11.35% in the last one year (as of 11/25/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $56.50.The ETF has a beta of 1.18 and standard deviation of 31.15% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 983 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $12.53 billion in assets, Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF has $24.69 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Texas Instruments' EPS has grown 21% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Texas Instruments shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 47% to 53%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Texas Instruments' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Texas Instruments, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$176m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Texas Instruments To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Texas Instruments' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Texas Instruments' continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Shares have added about 13.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Texas Instruments due for a pullback?

The top line was near the higher end of management’s guided range of $4.9-$5.3 billion. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 billion.Year-over-year top-line growth was driven by well-performing Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments.Sequential growth in automotive, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets remained a positive.However, softness in the personal electronics and industrial end-markets was a concern.Nevertheless, Texas Instruments’ efficient manufacturing strategies and continuous returns to its shareholders are likely to instill investors’ optimism on the stock. Its substantial investments in growth avenues and competitive advantages are other positives.Segments in DetailAnalog: Revenues of $3.99 billion were generated from the segment (76.2% of total revenues), up 13% from the year-ago quarter’s level.Embedded Processing: Revenues summed $821 million (15.7% of total revenues), up 11% year over year.Other: Revenues totaled $427 million (8.1% of total revenues).

TXN repurchased shares worth $996 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2022, Texas Instruments expects revenues between $4.4 billion and $4.8 billion.Texas Instruments expects earnings within $1.83-$2.11 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.28% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Texas Instruments has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

3,9dcb8a81-6a23-31b5-8287-a4f2c89cdbcb,TXN,2022-11-25,7 Value Stocks You Can Count On in This Uncertain Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-value-stocks-count-uncertain-022735639.html,1669084055,STORY,"['TXN', 'UNP', 'UPS', 'AMT', 'URI', '^GSPC', 'V']","[Value stocks are securities that that trade below intrinsic value. For any number of reasons, such value stocks may have fallen out of favor with investors and analysts. As such, the share price trades below what it should be worth based on the company’s fundamentals such as its earnings and book value. Most value stocks are older, more established companies where shares are trading at depressed or bargain prices. Value investors are people who take a long-term approach and buy a stock that is currently undervalued with the expectation that it will appreciate over time as the market eventually takes into account the company’s overall financial health as well as its future earnings potential.In fact, many of the most successful investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, identify themselves as value investors. They’re always on the hunt for stocks of good companies that are undervalued but should eventually recover and trade higher. Here are seven value stocks you can count on in this uncertain market.VVisa$212.34UPSUnited Parcel Service$183.65TXNTexas Instruments$179.14CETCentral Securities$34.96URIUnited Rentals$360.81UNPUnion Pacific$211.95AMTAmerican Tower$218.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks: Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit card giant Visa’s (NYSE:V) stock is down 6% this year and 12% below its 52-week high of $235. The median price target on the stock is currently $248 a share, which is 20% higher than its current level. This presents a rare opportunity for value investors with a long time horizon to buy shares in a great American company at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. Over the past five years, V stock had gained 85%.V stock had been as low as $178 a share in mid-Oct. before the company issued better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. The San Francisco-based company reported that it earned $1.93 a share on revenues of $7.79 billion in the July through September period. Wall Street had forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on revenues of $7.55 billion. Visa also announced in Oct. that it’s raising its quarterly dividend by 20%, providing even more value to shareholders.Story continuesValue Stocks: United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockWith the exception of, perhaps, the holidays, shipping parcels around the world isn’t a very exciting business. But as the world’s largest shipping and logistics company with annual revenues in 2021 of $85 billion, Atlanta, Georgia-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is the kind of value stock that investors can buy on the cheap with expectations that it will deliver long-term gains. UPS stock is down 16% on the year and trading at $180 a share. But over the last five years, the share price has grown 60%, and it is up 157% over the past decade.The median price target on UPS stock is currently $196, or nearly 10% higher than where the shares currently trade. For all of this year, UPS is forecasting revenue of about $102 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%. The company also intends to payout $5.20 billion in dividends to shareholders, giving it a strong yield of 3.37%. The company also plans to buy back at least $3 billion of its own stock. UPS stock currently trades at 14 times future earnings, which is below the average among stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making UPS shares look comparatively cheap.Value Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockDallas-based Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the kind of mature company that Wall Street has fallen out of love with and investors tend to ignore. However, discounting TXN stock would be a mistake. Today, Texas Instruments is a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. Unbeknownst to most people, the company is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world.TXN stock is down 10% this year and currently trading at $172 a share. However, over the last five years the shares have climbed 74% higher. Looking out 10 years, the stock has gained nearly 500%. If the share price appreciation isn’t enticing enough, consider also that Texas Instruments pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.76%. In addition, the stock looks quite undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more.Central Securities (CET)closed-end funds (CEFs)Source: ShutterstockCentral Securities (NYSEAMERICAN:CET) is a closed-end fund that offers great value to investors. In operation since 1929, Central Securities has been led since the 1970s by Wilmot Kidd III. While Kidd is also not a household name, he is regarded by many in professional investing circles as one of the greatest investors of all-time and the equal of Warren Buffett in terms of his returns.When Kidd took over Central Securities in 1974, the fund had $34 million in assets under management. Today that figure is $1.3 billion. While unknown to most, Central Securities has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A /BRK.B) over the past two decades. Central Securities has returned an annualized 14.5% with dividends reinvested to shareholders over the past 48 years, beating an 11.7% return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the same timeframe.Central Securities holds concentrated positions in a select number of stocks, some of which it has owned for 40 years. The company first bought Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock in 1986, and spent $700,000 to establish a position in private insurer Plymouth Rock back in 1982. The Plymouth Rock investment is worth more than $295 million today. Central Securities also has an extremely low expense ratio of less than 1% and has a history of paying outsized dividends. Down 23% this year, CET stock is a steal at its current price of $34 a share.United Rentals (URI)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockStamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world.  The company also boasts the biggest fleet of construction vehicles for rent on the planet. While URI stock has performed well, it gets scant attention from the media or public and continues to trade at levels that suggest it is undervalued. Year-to-date, United Rentals stock is up 6% and trading at $349 a share. That’s a significant outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500 that is down 18% in 2022. Over five years, the stock is up 128%.However, a price-earnings ratio of 12 is low and indicates that URI stock is trading at a discount right now. The median price target on the stock is $387.50, implying 11% upside from here. This is the type of stock that, while not cool, is necessary and manages to perform well in any market conditions.Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.Source: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.comUnion Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) is a major part of the U.S. rail infrastructure. Along with Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific forms a duopoly over long-haul freight rail service in the Western U.S., controlling much of the rail traffic west of the Mississippi River.This year, UNP stock is down 14% at $212 per share, and 24% below its 52-week high of $278.94. But over the last five years, the stock has climbed 80% higher, and it has gained nearly 250% since November 2012. Despite the success, Union Pacific’s stock trades at a modest 18 times forward earnings. Shareholders benefit from a dividend yield of 2.45%. Analysts seem to agree that there is more value to be extracted from Union Pacific. The 30 professional analysts who cover the company have a consensus “buy” rating on UNP stock.American Tower (AMT)Antenna Telephone and communication towers have a sunset background. American Tower (AMT) is one of the largest 4G tower operators in the U.S.Source: SERDTHONGCHAI / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). While most investors might yawn at the mere mention of a REIT, American Tower stands out as owner of the largest portfolio of wireless internet towers in the U.S. With its towers being adapted to handle fifth generation (5G) wireless, the company is rapidly expanding its infrastructure and network as demand soars for the most powerful internet possible.AMT stock is down 23% since January and changing hands at just under $220 a share. However, the shares have gained 50% over five years and grown 195% over the last decade. The P/E ratio is a little high at 34, but analysts seem to feel that the share price has room to run. The median price target on the stock is $240 a share, which would be about 10% above where it is currently trading. AMT stock also pays a solid quarterly dividend that yields 2.67%. The company’s earnings are forecast to rise steadily as demand for 5G internet continues to swell.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in V and CET.

4,6bc7c764-eac5-3e85-bef1-b9e5ae57a3e4,WDC,2022-11-25,Western Digital Corporation's (NASDAQ:WDC) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-corporations-nasdaq-wdc-134605344.html,1669297565,STORY,['WDC'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) recent performance, when its stock has declined 23% over the past three months. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Western Digital's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Western Digital How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Western Digital is:7.6% = US$917m ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Western Digital's Earnings Growth And 7.6% ROEWhen you first look at it, Western Digital's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 23%. Despite this, surprisingly, Western Digital saw an exceptional 25% net income growth over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Western Digital's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for WDC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Western Digital Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Western Digital doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryIn total, it does look like Western Digital has some positive aspects to its business. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.Have feedback on this article?

5,aa39294b-dff0-3122-818a-77ec9e7d7443,UNM,2022-11-25,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth to Navigate Volatile Markets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-solid-sales-growth-112911409.html,1669375751,STORY,"['UNM', 'CROX', 'CLH', 'LPLA']","[Concerns, including the persistent disruptions in the global supply chain system, record-high inflation and the aggressive monetary policy globally, continue to weigh on investor sentiments. These have led to an increase in recession risks in the next six to nine months.Amid such headwinds and market volatility, investors are wary about entering the market. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour, which will help generate robust returns. One such method is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Crocs, Inc. CROX, Unum Group UNM, QuidelOrtho Corporation QDEL, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA and Clean Harbors, Inc. CLH are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more analyzed than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Stable or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continuous bottom-line improvement usually requires robust sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn’t indicate much about a company’s prospects. So, taking into account a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a sensible investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Selecting the Potential Winning StocksTo shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePVH Corp. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PVH Corp. QuoteFactors to NotePVH Corp has been reeling under uncertainty related to the Ukraine war, macroeconomic challenges, inflationary pressure and the pandemic. Also, continued weakness in the North America business due to the ongoing supply-chain pressures and logistic delays have been concerning. This, along with higher inventory and reduced discretionary spending, is likely to have dented the fiscal third-quarter performance.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected a 4-5% year-over-year revenue decline for third-quarter fiscal 2022. This is inclusive of a 2% decrease from the war in Ukraine. The bottom line was predicted to be $2.10-$2.15. Notably, the company reported $3.89 and $2.67 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 35 cents, as well as 18 cents of adverse impacts of the Ukraine war.However, the company has been gaining from the continued momentum in its core brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, along with strength in its international business. The company's Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands are anticipated to have performed well in the quarter under review, driven by robust consumer demand. Also, strength across smart casual categories like woven shirts, dresses and pants bodes well.Also, the continued momentum in PVH Corp's international unit is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fiscal third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PVH Corp this season.

That would come in below both the 13.5% jump reported last year, and the 9.3% gain in 2020.Retailers, meanwhile, began running unusually early discounts this year to entice shoppers.Target Corp, Kohls Corp, and Amazon.com Inc ran so-called early Black Friday deals - the term for the day after the Thanksgiving holiday - that discounted toys and some other goods by as much as 50%.Those companies did not respond to comment for this story.Yet even with steep discounts, consumers will still have to spend more for popular products like a PJ Masks toy car or Mattel Inc's Mega Hauler semi-truck because prices have risen faster than promotions, according to data provided by DataWeave.Story continuesMattel did not respond to a request to comment.The attempts to lure shoppers comes as the closely-followed University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was revised up Wednesday to up to 56.8 from 54.7, beating the consensus expectation of 55.0 but still below the 59.9 index level from October. Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.Retailers have struggled to shift their offerings as consumers fully emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, leaving some companies bogged down with excess inventory.Walmart Inc, for instance, lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices. Target, meanwhile, forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.Shares of Walmart are up 7.5% for the month to date, while shares of Target are down 1.2%.Department store Macy's Inc raised its annual profit forecast last week. Shares of the company are up nearly 12% month-to-date. Kohl's, meanwhile, withdrew its forecast as it faces weakening demand due to rising prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7% month-to-date.Walmart, Macy's and Kohl's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by David Randall Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

Not only are they cheaper than their name-brand counterparts, but they also have a standard of quality that compares to more expensive brands. Here are 10 items you should always buy at Walmart, according to experts. carlosgaw / Getty ImagesGreat Value Hazelnut SpreadA 13-ounce jar of this Nutella knockoff is about 25% less than the same-size name-brand stuff, and you'll save even more by choosing Great Value over the premium brands. ""They taste so similar that no one is likely to know you bought the store brand and not the fancier stuff,"" said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews.Take Our Poll: Are You Struggling To Keep Up With Your Utility Bills?Fortyforks / Shutterstock.comGreat Value Peanut ButterA 40-ounce jar of the store-brand lunch staple is a bargain compared to a name brand like Jif, Skippy or Peter Pan. If you opt for the same amount of a pricier name-brand, ""you'll be paying nearly twice as much for something that tastes basically the same,"" advised Ramhold.nishka321 / Getty Images/iStockphotoEquate No-Metal Elastics""These are a beauty standard that anyone with longer hair that's fond of ponytails should keep in their beauty tool kit,"" said Ramhold.A 30-pack of the name-brand Goody Ouchless elastics could cost you 20% more than a 30-pack of Equate elastics. By choosing Equate, ""you'll get the same quality at a fraction of the cost, which if you have a tendency to lose them makes this an even better buy.""Story continuesEnes Evren / Getty Images/iStockphotoEquate Cotton SwabsGrab a 500 count of these staples for around one-third less than you'll pay for the name brand. ""There's no discernible difference between the store brand and name brand, so the Equate swabs should suffice just fine at a fraction of the cost,"" Ramhold said.Iakov Filimonov / Shutterstock.comEquate Blonde &amp; Silver Shampoo""This formulation is meant to make sure blonde and silver hairs look their brightest, but they tend to be on the pricier side,"" said Ramhold. Equate's purple shampoo provides the same benefits as the Shimmer Lights version, and it comes in a nearly identical bottle. But you'll get it for about 50% less.eugenekeebler / Getty Images/iStockphotoGreat Value Sweet Cream Coffee CreamerJanell Poulette of Saving You Dinero believes Great Value Sweet Cream Coffee Creamer is something you should always buy at Walmart. ""This is my favorite coffee creamer,"" she said. ""It's the right sweetness for my morning coffee.""Natural Bliss is one of the more popular name brand sweet creamers, but the price for a 32-ounce bottle is almost 40% higher than a same-size Great Value Sweet Cream Coffee Creamer.Shutterstock.comGreat Value Chocolate ChipsI bake a lot!"" said Poulette. ""[Walmart's] chocolate chips are much cheaper and just as delicious as the name brands.""No matter what type of chocolate baking chips you like to use -- semi-sweet or milk chocolate -- Walmart has them for a great price. A 12-ounce bag of Great Value Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips costs less than any of the name brands Walmart carries, and it's an especially good deal compared to premium brands like Ghirardelli.Chekyravaa / Shutterstock.comGreat Value Chewy Variety Pack Granola Bars""My kids love to have access to granola bars for a quick snack, and they love the variety pack I can pick up at Walmart,"" said Poulette.It can be a little harder to compare Great Value against packages from Quaker and other big names because they don't always have the same variety in the same-size package. But priced per-bar, Great Value lives up to its name no matter what size or flavor you buy.Jiri Hera / Shutterstock.comGreat Value Salsa""I love to throw a jar of salsa and chicken breasts into the crockpot for the easiest, kid-friendly meal. [Walmart's] salsa is perfect for this meal,"" Poulette said.You can pick up a 24-ounce jar of Great Value Thick &amp; Chunky Salsa for less than a 16 oz. jar of the equvalent Chi-Chi's or Pace-brand salsa.DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.comGreat Value Cooking Oil""When we had a fish fry for Good Friday, I was asked to pick up a gallon of oil,"" said Poulette, noting that even the store brands were pricey at her local supermarket.Walmart's Great Value Canola Oil compares favorably to the lowest-cost store brands Poulette saw.

(NYSE:MMC) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.How Is Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' Growth Trending?Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 26%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 130% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.5% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.0% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's alarming that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

(NYSE:IT). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Gartner’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Gartner What Is Gartner Worth?Gartner is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 35.68x is currently well-above the industry average of 28.49x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Gartner’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Gartner look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -1.4% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Gartner. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe IT should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on IT for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its industry peers, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Gartner.If you are no longer interested in Gartner, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.

While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

There was no WTI settlement on Thursday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and trading volumes remained low.""Because there's light volume after the holiday, we're giving up some of the gains here a bit,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.Both contracts posted their third consecutive weekly declines after hitting 10-month lows this week. Brent ended the week down 4.6%, while WTI fell 4.7%.Brent and WTI's market structure implies current demand is softening, with backwardation, defined by front-month prices trading above contracts for later delivery, having weakened markedly in recent sessions.For two-month spreads, Brent and WTI's structures even dipped into contango this week, implying oversupply with near-term delivery contracts priced below later deliveries.China, the world's top oil importer, on Friday reported a new daily record for COVID-19 infections, as cities across the country continued to enforce mobility measures and other curbs to control outbreaks.This is starting to hit fuel demand, with traffic drifting down and implied oil demand around 1 million barrels per day lower than average, an ANZ note showed.Meanwhile, G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing a Russian oil price cap between $65 and $70 a barrel, but an agreement has still not been reached. A meeting of European Union government representatives, scheduled for Friday evening to discuss the proposal, was cancelled, EU diplomats said.The aim is to limit revenue to fund Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets, but the proposed level is broadly in line with what Asian buyers are already paying.Story continuesPoland is seeking German support to slap EU sanctions on the Polish-German section of the Druzhba crude pipeline so Warsaw can abandon a deal to buy Russian oil next year without paying penalties, two sources familiar with the talks said.Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on Dec. 5 when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies on Dec. 4.(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York; Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London, Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Kirsten Donovan and Cynthia Osterman)]"

We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the top 10 tech stock picks of Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners as of the third quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these tech stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months.However, we should keep the 2022 market crash in mind when reading this article. You will notice that most of the stocks in this list lost value over the past 12 months. That doesn't, however, mean that GQG was entirely wrong. It's a major hedge fund that believes in holding stocks for longer periods of time. These tech holdings might end up creating profits for the hedge fund in the months and years to come as analysts believe the market could rebound strongly in 2023 and beyond.Before seeing the tech stock picks of GQG, let's see our primer on the hedge fund and its manager we wrote back in January.GQG Partners was founded by Rajiv Jain in 2016, who is the chairman, portfolio manager, and chief investment officer of the hedge fund.

Shares have added about 16% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Moody's due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Moody's Q3 Earnings Miss, Revenues Decline Y/YMoody's reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06. The bottom line also plunged 31% from the year-ago quarter figure.Subdued issuance volume was a major headwind, which hurt Moody’s results. A rise in operating expenses posed an undermining factor. However, strategic buyouts strengthened the MA segment’s performance. The company’s liquidity position was robust during the quarter.After taking into consideration certain non-recurring items, net income attributable to Moody's Corporation was $303 million or $1.65 per share, down from $474 million or $2.53 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Down, Costs UpRevenues were $1.28 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion. The top line declined 16% year over year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by 4%.Total expenses were $873 million, up 1%. The rise was mainly due to operational and transaction-related costs related to the recent acquisitions. Foreign currency translation positively impacted operating expenses by 5%.Adjusted operating income of $497 million was down 33%. Adjusted operating margin was 39%, down from 48.3% a year ago.Mixed Segment PerformanceMoody’s Investors Service revenues plunged 36% year over year to $590 million. The fall was mainly due to muted capital market activities. Foreign currency translation affected the segment’s revenues by 3%.Moody’s Analytics revenues grew 14% to $685 million. This was mainly driven by the RMS acquisition and steady demand for Know Your Customer solutions and credit research. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted the segment’s revenues by 7%.Story continuesStrong Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2022, Moody’s had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.75 billion, down from $1.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2021.The company had $7.5 billion in outstanding debt and $1.25 billion in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the quarter, Moody's repurchased shares worth $113 million.2022 GuidanceMoody’s lowered its earnings guidance on subdued year-to-date performance and “the ongoing macro uncertainties.” The company expects adjusted earnings of $8.20-$8.50 per share, down from the prior mentioned $9.20-$9.70 per share.On a GAAP basis, earnings are projected to be $6.90-$7.20 per share, lower than the earlier mentioned $8.10-$8.60 per share.Moody’s projects revenues to decrease in the low-double-digit percent range, a change from the earlier stated fall in the high-single-digit percent range.Operating expenses are projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, changed from previously mentioned high-single-digit percent growth.Net interest expenses are expected to be $220-$240 million.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 42%, down from the prior stated 44%.The operating margin is likely to be 34-35%, lower than 37-38% previously targeted.Moody’s expects cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion, lower than $1.7-$1.9 billion stated earlier. Similarly, free cash flow is projected to be $1.2 billion, down from $1.4-$1.6 billion mentioned previously.The company will likely repurchase shares worth $1 billion.The effective tax rate is projected to be 20.5-22.5%.Segment Outlook for 2022MIS segment revenues are anticipated to decline 30%, a change from the prior stated decrease in the low-twenties percent range.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 51%, lower than the previously stated 54-55%.Coming to the MA segment, Moody’s anticipates revenues to grow in the mid-teens percent range.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 30%, changed from the previously mentioned 29%. Further, the segment’s organic Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) is projected to rise in the low-double-digit percent range.2022-2023 Geolocation Restructuring ProgramManagement expects the program to help the company further adapt to the new global workplace and talent realities. Also, the restructuring plan will accelerate a number of ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives, and includes real estate optimization and increased utilization of lower-cost operational hubs.The program is expected to result in annualized savings of $100-$135 million per year.The exit from certain leased office spaces is expected to begin late in 2022 or early 2023 and is expected to result in $50-$70 million of pre-tax charges to either terminate or sublease the affected real estate leases.The program also includes $75-$100 million of pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, an amount that includes severance and related costs primarily determined under the company’s existing severance plans.Cash outlays associated with the program are expected to be $75-$100 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024.The program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2023.Medium-Term TargetsMoody’s projects total revenue growth of at least 10%, with adjusted operating margin in the low-50s range.

Higher rates have dampened the growth outlook and challenge valuations in the tech sector.Meta Platforms (META), which is down 66% this year and among the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500, fell out of the top five among top hedge fund holdings for the first time since 2014.Goldman’s hedge fund “VIP” basket is comprised of the 50 stocks that appear most often among the top 10 holdings of fundamental hedge funds, which have roughly $1.5 trillion worth of long equity positions.

42,184478a9-71d0-3ab5-9738-7516c5c8d94f,ADM,2022-11-25,3 Reasons Why ADM (ADM) Is a Great Growth Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-adm-adm-174505921.html,1669311905,STORY,['ADM'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this agribusiness giant a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for ADM is 21.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 42.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 38.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ADM is 31.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 19.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of -1.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for ADM have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 7.4% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made ADM a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions ADM well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 3.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Archer Daniels Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Rise Y/YArcher Daniels posted stellar third-quarter 2022 results, wherein both the top and the bottom line advanced year over year and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results were bolstered by robust global demand, gains from the integrated global value chain, a solid product portfolio and ADM’s team expertise in navigating dynamic market conditions. Management cited that ADM is well poised to conclude 2022 on a solid note, continuing the momentum into 2023.Q3 HighlightsArcher Daniels’ adjusted earnings of $1.86 per share in the third quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42. The figure also surged 91.8% from 97 cents in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were $1.83 per share, up 96.8% from the prior-year quarter’s $1.26.Revenues advanced 21.4% year over year to $24,683 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,912 million. Solid sales across all the segments contributed to the top line.Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds grew 22% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutions’ revenues rose 24.9% year over year. The Nutrition segment witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 9.8%.The gross profit increased 36.6% year over year to $1,811 million, while the gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 7.3% in the quarter under review. SG&amp;A expenses rose 13.6% to $818 million.Archer Daniels reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,579 million in third-quarter 2022, up 57.6% from the year-ago quarter’s level. On a GAAP basis, ADM’s segmental operating profits grew 55.9% year over year to $1,559 million.Story continuesSegmental Operating ProfitAdjusted operating profit for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds rose 73.9% year over year to $1,075 million. The short crops in South America boosted U.S. exports, and improved volumes and margins in North American origination. Improved margins in global ocean freight, driven by efficient execution amid dynamic global trade flows powered by solid results in Global Trade. South American origination witnessed improved volumes and margins on higher farmer selling in addition to elevated volumes through the export facilities.Crushing results were sharply higher along with margins on resilient global demand for both the meal and oil. Solid rapeseed margins in EMEA, aided by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations coupled with positive impacts from an insurance settlement, drove results. North American soy crush margins continued to gain from renewable diesel demand. Solid results were partly offset by reduced crush volumes, including impacts of idled facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay.Refined Products and Other results were strong year over year, benefiting from a robust margin environment for refined oils and biodiesel. Solid performance in global refined oils was led by healthy demand and higher refined oil margins despite supply-chain headwinds. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher than the year-earlier quarter’s figure.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit grew 45.1% to $309 million. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, recorded improved year-over-year results, and global demand for sweeteners and starches.Corn co-products with continued robust demand for corn oil and effective risk management expanded execution margins in North America. Wheat milling was strong, generating better volumes and margins to serve robust demand for flour. In EMEA, the business saw higher volumes and margins amid a dynamic energy environment.Vantage Corn Processors’ results were soft. Ethanol margins were affected by reduced domestic demand and higher corn costs.In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $177 million grew 0.6% from $176 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit gained from solid demand for plant-based proteins, a robust performance in texturants and strength in Specialty Ingredients. Animal Nutrition results were weaker than the year-earlier quarter’s level.Pet results were down in Latin America due to soft volumes, partly offset by sturdy volumes and margins in North America. Weak animal protein demand adversely impacted feed volumes.Other FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,099 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,559 million and shareholders’ equity of $24,029 million. In the nine months ending Sep 30, 2022, ADM used $3,348 million of cash for operating activities.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 7.82% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, ADM has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise ADM has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Moreover, the bottom line improved by more than 100% year over year.Revenues of $6,220 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,228.1 million but improved 32.9% year over year on the back of an improvement in leisure demand and close-in bookings in September 2022.Southwest Airlines Co. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteHow is Southwest Airlines Doing?Continued recovery in air-travel demand (mainly on the leisure front) has been aiding Southwest Airlines’ top-line performance. Notably, in the third quarter of 2022, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 7.2% year over year to 33.53 billion. The company’s top line also benefitted from its loyalty program, including elevated point redemptions for flights and incremental revenues from its co-brand credit card agreement, along with increased upgraded Boarding take-rates following the new digital self-service launch in August 2022.Anticipating the trend to continue, Southwest Airlines’ management expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating revenues to register 13-17% growth compared with 2019.LUV’s liquidity position further raises optimism in the stock. At the end of the third quarter, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $10,443 million, higher than the long-term debt (less current maturities) of $8,315 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its debt obligations.Despite the aforementioned tailwinds, escalating fuel prices continue to remain a concern. In third-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) surged 68.7% year over year to $3.39. Economic fuel costs per gallon are expected between $3.15 and $3.25 for the fourth quarter. For 2022, economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated between $3.05 and $3.15 (prior view: $2.95 - $3.05).Story continuesApart from the increase in fuel costs, the rise in labor and airport costs are also likely to dent bottom-line growth by resulting in a spike in operating expenses. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 14-18% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the comparable period in 2019. For 2022, CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, is expected to rise 14-15% (prior view: 12-16%) from 2019. High capex may also play a spoilsport.Softness in managed business revenues continues. Managed business revenues declined 28% in third-quarter 2022 from the comparable 2019 level. The metric softened in July and August compared with June 2022 and experienced sequential improvement from August to September. Managed business revenues fell 25% in September from the comparable 2019 level. For fourth-quarter 2022, managed business revenues are expected to decline in the 20-25% band from fourth-quarter 2019.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector are Air Transport Services Group ATSG, Ryder Systems R and Teekay Tankers Ltd.

(NYSE:PM) is a multinational cigarette and tobacco product manufacturing company based in New York. With products sold in over 180 countries, its most recognized and famous brands include Marlboro.According to GQG Partners' 13F filings for the third quarter of 2021, the fund holds over 14.2 million shares of Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth more than $1.39 billion, representing 3.69% of the fund's portfolio value.Terry Smith of Fundsmith LLP is one of the biggest stakeholders of Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM) as of the end of the third quarter, according to the data tracked by Insider Monkey. Overall, 48 funds were bullish on the company by the end of Q3, compared to 46 in the previous quarter.9. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.37 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -41%Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a Connecticut-based telecommunications and mass media company that provides broadband communications and entertainment services.According to the third quarter securities filings, Rajiv Jain's hedge fund owned over 1.88 million shares in Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) worth $1.37 billion and representing 3.76% of the portfolio value.On November 22, Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould lowered the price target on Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) to $730 from $815, and kept a Hold rating on the shares after assuming coverage of the company. The analyst notes that Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) reported a mixed quarter, with solid financials but weak subscribers.In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included communication services, where Charter trailed after generating robust returns earlier in the recovery.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.4 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: +17%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a multinational healthcare and insurance company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. One of the largest companies in the world based on revenue, it provides healthcare products, health care coverage, software, and data consultancy services.Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners currently holds over 3.6 million shares of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These shares are valued at $1.4 billion and account for 3.87% of the investment firm's portfolio.On November 16, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised his price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $477 from $421, and kept a Buy rating on the shares of the company after the quarterly filing release.Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boykin Curry's Eagle Capital Management is one of the leading shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  (NYSE:UNH), with 3 million shares worth approximately $1.2 billion.Wedgewood Partners mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q3 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group detracted from performance due to investor concerns about Medicare premiums as well as post-COVID medical cost trends. Medicare enrollment should continue to grow at double-digits at UnitedHealthcare. Meanwhile the Company’s Optum segment should be able to help bend the cost curve if indeed post-COVID volumes pick up to above pre-COVID levels. In any case, we do not think the long-term normalized trend of medical care in the U.S. has changed substantially and would look to add to our new position on any continuing short-term concerns.”7. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.56 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: +78%Based in Irving, Texas, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s largest multinational oil and gas companies that manufactures and transports crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Although the U.S Energy sector has posted strong gains year-to-date, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) seems to have lagged due to its late transition into the sector.Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners owns over 26.5 million shares in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), valued at $1.56 billion, making up 4.28% of the fund’s 13F portfolio. Of the 867 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 64 reported holding stakes in the company by the end of the third quarter. Jean-Marie Eviellard of First Eagle Investment Management is among the leading shareholders in the company.On October 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott kept an Overweight ratings on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), alongside an $84 price target on the company's shares.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, First Eagle Investment Management stated that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of the leading contributors in the fund for the quarter. Here is what they said:“Leading contributors in the First Eagle Global Fund this quarter included Exxon Mobil Corporation. The continued recovery in oil prices as economies reopen helped fuel another strong performance across the energy complex, including shares of Exxon Mobil. Exxon Mobil recently lost a proxy fight with an activist investor that took three of the company’s 12 board seats. While the press was focused on the investor’s concerns over Exxon Mobil’s long term energy transformation strategy, other factors fundamental to shareholder returns—like capital discipline and balance sheet management—were also at play.”6. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.68 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -26%One of the Big Five US Tech corporations, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational firm based in Washington.

In aggregate, we believe we were able to increase expected earnings growth while reducing risk and the overall portfolio valuation… We also trimmed Microsoft, which had grown to nearly 10% of the Portfolio. At an 8% weighting, it still represents one of our largest positions.” Click to continue reading and see Was Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners Right About These 5 Stocks?.

47,f8acc422-af01-31aa-ac92-9c3e461c8f42,SPG,2022-11-25,7 Juicy Dividends to Be Thankful For This Year,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-juicy-dividends-thankful-014119260.html,1669081279,STORY,"['PLD', 'SPG', 'AFCG', 'MO', 'KO', 'ADC']","[High-yielding dividend stocks have been some of the safest investments of 2022.In fact, “The recent outperformance of dividend stocks is contrary to the traditional wisdom that they tend to lag the overall market in a rising-rate environment. This theory’s adherents think rate hikes make newly issued fixed-income products more attractive and reduce the appeal of stable income from equities. Some investors also argue that higher rates make it harder for companies to pay back debt, let alone sustain healthy dividend payouts. But neither argument holds up this year,” reported Institutional Investor.Instead, it has again been proven that companies with attractive yields tend to outperform even the worst of markets over time, as I noted on Nov. 7. Now, with just weeks to go before we bid adieu to 2022, we wanted to take a look at some of the juiciest dividend stocks of the year. I think these high-yielding dividend stocks will continue to outperform in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSPGSimon Property Group$117.18AFCGAFC Gamma$16.73ADCAgree Realty$70.30PLDPrologis$114.95KOCoca-Cola$62.08MOAltria Group$44.80KSSKohl’s$30.93Simon Property Group (SPG)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comWhile most of 2022 was miserable for dividend stocks such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), it’s a REIT well worth paying attention to. Indeed, with a solid yield of 6.1%, this $44 billion owner of shopping centers all around the world is worth a look.While we often hear about the “death of the mall,” occupancy rates for U.S. malls and outlets jumped to 94.5% in the third quarter, as compared to 92.8% in the same quarter last year. Not only were occupancy rates rising, but so were rental rates. In fact, rent per sq. ft. was $54.80, as of Sept. from $53.91 year over year. Better, Simon Property Group says it’s on track to achieve pre-COVID occupancy by New Year 2023.“The flight towards bricks and mortar is real,” CEO David Simon said, as quoted by Footwear News. “The returns on e-commerce just aren’t quite what everybody talked about.” In addition, since cutting its dividend in 2020, the company has raised its distribution six times since then, which tells us the company is on the mend.Story continuesSimon Property Group also just raised its 2022 guidance. The REIT now expects net income to fall in the range of $6.16 to $6.21 per diluted share. Additionally, it expects comparable FFO to be in a range of $11.83 to $11.88 per diluted share, which is an increase of 12 to 26 cents per diluted share.AFC Gamma (AFCG)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAt the moment, AFC Gamma (NASDAQ:AFCG) carries a dividend yield of 13.2%. I expect that dividend to remain intact, especially with more states and countries throughout Europe looking to legalize cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes. Additionally, I think federal legalization may be possible sooner than later, especially with such a large percentage of Americans in support of legalization.AFC Gamma is not a landlord. Instead, the company provides financing, such as mortgage and construction loans, to help cannabis companies that typically can’t secure traditional financing from banks. The company currently holds 13 loans across 17 states. In its most recent quarter, the REIT reported net income of $11.5 million, a 45% increase year-over-year. Distributable earnings were also up to $11.8 million, a 64% year-over-year improvement.Agree Realty (ADC)Source: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 4.1%, Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is another interesting real estate company I’ve been focusing on. Much of this has to do with the company’s business model, which is aimed at acquiring and developing properties that are net leased to industry-leading omnichannel retail tenants. These tenants include the likes of blue-chip names such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD).At the moment, this company has just under 36 million square feet of space it leases to those reliable investment-grade tenants. Better, as of September, the company acquired another 303 properties across 42 states for about $1.19 billion.This company’s growing property portfolio has allowed it to recently increase its monthly dividend to 24 cents per share, which amounts to $2.88 per share annualized. Even more impressive are its recent earnings. In its second quarter, the company posted revenue of $104.9 million, as compared to expectations of $102.3 million. Agree also increased its full-year acquisition guidance to a new range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.Prologis (PLD)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a warehouse REIT showing big signs of life again. At the moment, the REIT owns more than a billion square feet of real estate across 4,914 buildings in about 19 countries, with about $165 billion of assets under management. Better, the REIT has grown its dividend payout at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, making it among the top dividend stocks on my list right now. Currently, PLD stock yields 2.8%.Prologis is benefiting from a massive gap between rental rates on existing leases, and current market rates. So, as leases expire, Prologis is able to sign new leases at higher rates. Accordingly, the company anticipates its effective same-store net operating income (SSNOI) could grow between 8% and 10% for the next few years.Even better, the REIT is betting big on electric vehicles. Currently, Prologis is installing EV charging infrastructure in several large U.S. industrial markets. “Prologis is helping its customers transition their commercial fleets to zero emissions transportation, spanning heavy-duty trucks (18 wheels) to last-mile vans. With more than 1.2 billion square feet of logistics properties around the globe, deep development expertise, and relationships with some of the world’s largest brands, the company is uniquely positioned to help accelerate the adoption of electric fleets,” as noted by the company.Coca-Cola (KO)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockWith strong demand, dependable dividends, and incredible earnings growth, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best dividend stocks to consider as a long-term investment.Coca-Cola is also a dividend king, raising its dividend for the last 60+ years. This stock currently carries a yield of 2.9% and continues to be one of the safest stocks on the market. In addition, in its most recent quarter, the company posted earnings per share of 69 cents on sales of $11.1 billion. That’s up from the 65 cents on sales of $10 billion during the same quarter last year. Analysts were looking for 64 cents on sales of $10.5 billion.For the year, the company expects revenue growth to fall in the range of 14% and 15%, which is higher than its initial forecast of 12% to 13%. Coca-Cola also raised its growth estimates on adjusted earnings per share to a new range of 6% to 7%, from 5% to 6%. As a show of faith in the company, director Herb Allen just bought 33,200 shares for $2 million. That’s reason enough for me to be bullish on this stalwart company.Altria Group (MO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockCurrently, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) carries a yield of 8.5%. But that’s not the most impressive item of note for this top high-yielding dividend stock.Over the last 53 years, the company has raised its dividend 57 times, which makes it another Dividend King on this list. In fact, as of August, the company raised its dividend for the 57th time to $3.76 per share annually.Granted, sales of cigarettes are on the decline. However, vaping and e-cigarette use is on the rise. In fact, about one in 20 Americans now vape, with product sales expected to hit $40 billion by 2023. This is a trend Altria can capitalize on, with the help of a partnership the company recently entered into with Japan Tobacco to develop smoke-free products.Notably, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Pamela Kaufman raised the firm’s target price on MO to $109 from $102, with an overweight rating.Kohl’s (KSS)a bag on a table with the word ""dividends"" on it. represent dividend stocks to buySource: ShutterstockWith a yield of 6.5%, shares of Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) are attractive as a contrarian bet. This is among the most beaten-down dividend stocks of the year thanks to sky-high inflation, consumer cutbacks, poor earnings, slashed guidance, and supply chain issues. But don’t write the stock off just yet. Most of these issues are only temporary, and the company may soon see a solid turnaround. Plus, should inflation start to cool off, even more retailers like Kohl’s could be set up for a strong come back.One catalyst worth considering is that the company’s CEO just stepped down. Additionally, the company just announced preliminary earnings that were better than expected. Kohl’s now anticipates earnings per share to come in at 82 cents, as compared to expectations of 63 cents.If that’s not an indication that this is a top dividend stock to buy this holiday season, I don’t know what is.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Shares have added about 18.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Universal Health Services due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Health Q3 Earnings Top on Better Patient VolumesUniversal Health Services reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. However, the bottom line fell 4.9% year over year.UHS’ quarterly results benefited from higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical personnel that continues to grapple most U.S. healthcare providers.Consequently, the margins of Universal Health took a hit as it had to incur elevated labor costs in the form of recruiting expensive temporary personnel or raising wages and benefits to attract and retain nurses and other clinical staff to counter the staffing scarcity.Quarterly Operational UpdateNet revenues of $3.3 billion improved 5.7% year over year in the third quarter. The top line outpaced the consensus mark by a whisker.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization (EBITDA), net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (NCI), declined 4.6% year over year to $427.8 million.Total operating costs of $3.1 billion increased 7.7% year over year, primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.Segmental UpdateAcute Care Hospital ServicesIn the third quarter, adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) rose 1.9% year over year on a same-facility basis, while adjusted patient days declined 5% year over year.

Significant growth came on the back of a favorable change from the early return of Medicare-accelerated payments received in 2020 and repaid in first-quarter 2021.Share Repurchase UpdateUniversal Health bought back around 1.6 million shares worth $157.9 million. UHS had $1.1 billion left under its total repurchase authorization as of Sep 30, 2022.2022 GuidanceEarlier, management anticipated net revenues to be $13.235-$13.371 billion for this year, the midpoint of which implies 5.2% growth from the 2021 figure.Adjusted EBITDA, net of NCI, was estimated within $1.635-$1.712 billion. The midpoint of the outlook indicates an 11.9% decline from the reported figure of 2021.UHS expected adjusted earnings per share for 2022 in the range of $9.60-$10.40, the mid-point of which suggests a 15.4% drop from the 2021 reported figure.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.19% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Universal Health Services has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

(NYSE:GS) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-goldman-sachs-group-101530437.html,1669371330,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Readers hoping to buy The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Goldman Sachs Group's shares on or after the 30th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.50 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$10.00 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Goldman Sachs Group has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current share price of $386.25. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Goldman Sachs Group has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 22% of its income after tax.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Goldman Sachs Group's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Goldman Sachs Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 22% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpHas Goldman Sachs Group got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Companies like Goldman Sachs Group that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Overall, Goldman Sachs Group looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while Goldman Sachs Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

QuoteFurthermore, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $8 billion for 2022, indicating a 3.9% year-over-year rise.Key DriversThe growing demand for digital payment methods is expected to support Global Payments’ transaction volume growth. In the third quarter, its commercial card transactions grew 25% year over year. The momentum is not expected to subside anytime soon. This will continue supporting the company’s revenue growth. GPN expects 2022 adjusted net revenues to grow 8.9-9.8% from the 2021 reported figure.With the relaxation of COVID-19-related restrictions, spending on travel and entertainment is bound to rise. Despite inflationary pressure, consumer spending keeps growing, which is good news for GPN. Also, the company’s ongoing investments in technology are leading to a shift in its business mix toward technology enablement, which will support its strong financial performance.Global Payments’ strategic acquisitions to grow its overall business are effectively boosting its scale. It strengthened the technology platform through buyouts like APT, PayPros, Heartland, etc. Also, acquisitions of Total System Services, Zego, Mineral Tree and others are improving its presence in multiple fields across various markets. It is now looking forward to acquiring leading payment technology and services provider EVO Payments EVOP for $4 billion to strengthen its footprint in the business-to-business space.Story continuesIts financial flexibility enables the company to focus on strategic investments and return capital to shareholders. GPN exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,993.8 million, way above the current portion of long-term debt of $1,157.8 million.In the first nine months of 2022, net cash provided by operating activities came in at $1,534.5 million. It bought back shares worth $889.7 million during the third quarter. An increase in the capacity of GPN’s share buyback program was made to bring the total authorization amount to $1.5 billion.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that are impeding the growth of the stock.Increasing costs are eating into its profits. Despite implementing multiple cost-control measures, the company's operating expenses are on the rise. In the first nine months of 2022, its operating costs rose 22.6% year over year, which incorporated a significant amount of goodwill impairment charges. This can dent the company's profit levels.Rising competition in the payment market is concerning. Emerging payment companies with significant growth potential are capturing markets at a faster rate. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive GPN’s long-term growth.Better-Ranked PlayersSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are PaySign, Inc.

That would come in below both the 13.5% jump reported last year, and the 9.3% gain in 2020.Retailers, meanwhile, began running unusually early discounts this year to entice shoppers.Target Corp, Kohls Corp, and Amazon.com Inc ran so-called early Black Friday deals - the term for the day after the Thanksgiving holiday - that discounted toys and some other goods by as much as 50%.Those companies did not respond to comment for this story.Yet even with steep discounts, consumers will still have to spend more for popular products like a PJ Masks toy car or Mattel Inc's Mega Hauler semi-truck because prices have risen faster than promotions, according to data provided by DataWeave.Story continuesMattel did not respond to a request to comment.The attempts to lure shoppers comes as the closely-followed University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was revised up Wednesday to up to 56.8 from 54.7, beating the consensus expectation of 55.0 but still below the 59.9 index level from October. Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.Retailers have struggled to shift their offerings as consumers fully emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, leaving some companies bogged down with excess inventory.Walmart Inc, for instance, lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices. Target, meanwhile, forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.Shares of Walmart are up 7.5% for the month to date, while shares of Target are down 1.2%.Department store Macy's Inc raised its annual profit forecast last week. Shares of the company are up nearly 12% month-to-date. Kohl's, meanwhile, withdrew its forecast as it faces weakening demand due to rising prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7% month-to-date.Walmart, Macy's and Kohl's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by David Randall Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

(NASDAQ:MAT) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 24% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 53% during that period.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Mattel investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. View our latest analysis for Mattel To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Mattel became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Mattel has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling Mattel stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveThe total return of 19% received by Mattel shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -19%. So last year was actually even worse than the last five years, which cost shareholders 0.1% per year. Weak performance over the long term usually destroys market confidence in a stock, but bargain hunters may want to take a closer look for signs of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Mattel (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesBut note: Mattel may not be the best stock to buy.

Schlumberger (SLB) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.Schlumberger is a member of our Oils-Energy group, which includes 249 different companies and currently sits at #4 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Schlumberger is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SLB's full-year earnings has moved 6.1% higher. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.Our latest available data shows that SLB has returned about 71.7% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, the Oils-Energy sector has returned an average of 42.9% on a year-to-date basis. This means that Schlumberger is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.Another Oils-Energy stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Vista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR (VIST). The stock has returned 149% year-to-date.Over the past three months, Vista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V.

54,c82e6ff3-3238-3a42-b26d-90d5d7f1205c,SLB,2022-11-25,Investors Heavily Search Schlumberger Limited (SLB): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-schlumberger-limited-140002498.html,1669298402,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 11.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share, indicating a change of +65.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.14 points to a change of +67.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3 indicates a change of +40.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Schlumberger is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.4%. The $27.9 billion and $32.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.7% and +17.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.36 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.67%. The EPS surprise was +14.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While we are closely monitoring the potential impact of these dynamics, industry demand remains robust, driven by strong consumer balance sheets and pent-up demand after multiple years of constrained production. We also remain confident in GM's ability to navigate a complex operating environment, which the company has consistently demonstrated over the past few years. Finally, the long-term picture remains bright. We believe GM is significantly undervalued, is well-positioned for the long-term transition to electric vehicles and has numerous needle-moving ancillary business opportunities (most notably Cruise, which is an industry leader in autonomous vehicle technology) that are underappreciated. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Pet Food Companies in the World25 Most Polluted Countries in the World15 Biggest Fintech Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
56,411da3e7-5ad0-33d8-928d-59222cab0675,NTRS,2022-11-25,Is FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexshares-international-quality-dividend-etf-112011851.html,1669375211,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Launched on 04/12/2013, the FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Flexshares, IQDF has amassed assets over $479.93 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. IQDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.47%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.IQDF's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 5.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) accounts for about 3.07% of the fund's total assets, followed by Roche Holding Ag Common Stock Chf 0 (ROG) and Nestle Sa Common Stock Chf 0.1 (NESN).Performance and RiskSo far this year, IQDF has lost about -16.44%, and is down about -14.53% in the last one year (as of 11/25/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $17.72 and $26.19.The ETF has a beta of 0.82 and standard deviation of 22.19% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 299 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $44.41 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $65.64 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

57,a4a61fcf-2f7a-39b6-b5e3-5de1d47a0fc9,AIG,2022-11-25,15 Largest Bankruptcies in American History,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-bankruptcies-american-history-211232248.html,1669324352,STORY,['AIG'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 biggest bankruptcies in American history. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Bankruptcies in American History.While companies are established to earn profits and reward owners and shareholders, in addition to customers and employees, not many companies are able to become profitable. Initially, when a company is newly established, it doesn't expect to become profitable for some time, often a few years. This is because higher capital investment is required at the initial stages, with costs being significantly high while having little revenue as a company attempts to establish itself and earn customers and a positive reputation. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20% of all new businesses fail in their first two years, 45% fail during the first five years and 65% of businesses fail in 10 years or more. Only 25% of businesses are successful beyond 15 years.The Covid-19 pandemic really devastated many businesses, especially small ones. Hundreds of businesses folded as most states in the country went into lockdowns and businesses weren't able to operate as they would in normal circumstances. While the U.S. government did give PPP loans (paycheck protection programs) to business owners to allow them to pay their employees on time, many businesses still were unable to continue operating. The PPP program was worth $953 billion and the cost of the program was really high which led to criticism as estimates suggested that $169k - $258k were spent on every job saved, and many of the loans were then waived off, even for rich business owners. And to top it all off, more than a hundred such loans were made to businesses which didn't even have any name, while some loans were received by businesses owned by members of Congress.Outside of the pandemic, once a business has been running for over a decade, odds of success are high. This is why major bankruptcies are rare nowadays unless there is a major recession as happened in 2008. Many major companies in the U.S. are actually deemed too big to fail because their collapse would be devastating to the economy of the country and hence, have to be supported by the government with bailouts in case of collapse. This was seen in the market crash of 2007-2008 where the government bailed out many major corporations including American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) which was given $180 billion by the government. While many people mention this statistic, few mention that American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) actually paid back $205 billion to the government in 2012. American International Group, Inc. (AIG) has since rebounded in a strong way and earned over $52 billion in revenue in 2021.Story continuesHowever, every once in a while, there is a major bankruptcy that reverberates through the industry. Nowadays, this is becoming alarmingly common in the unregulated industry that is the cryptocurrency industry. Through 2020 and most of 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, went from high to high, followed by hundreds of other cryptocurrencies that made many early investors large fortunes. The consistent increase in value of cryptocurrencies led to more and more people investing their savings in the industry, which led to the establishment of several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN). However, since the end of 2021, the cryptocurrency industry has been in a downward spiral which has resulted in many exchanges declaring bankruptcy. Many smaller cryptocurrency companies have collapsed earlier, such as Celsius, a cryptocurrency lender which has offices in four countries. In June 2022, while the company had around $12 billion in assets under management, the company paused all transfers as well as withdrawals because of extreme market conditions, before filing for bankruptcy in July 2022, with the prices of cryptocurrencies declining significantly after the news broke.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashHowever, the biggest bankruptcy came very recently, when FTX, a Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange, had to declare bankruptcy.15. Refco IncTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $33,333The New York-based financial services company became bankrupt in 2005, at a time when it was the biggest broker on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, just two months after becoming a public company.14. Financial Corp of AmericaTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $33,864One of the earliest bankruptcies in our list, the Financial Corporation of America filed for bankruptcy in 1988.13. Texaco, IncTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $34,940After losing a case worth over $10 billion to Pennzoil after Texaco established a contract to buy Getty Oil despite Pennzoil already having an agreement for the same, Texaco filed for bankruptcy in 1987. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history for 14 years.12. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)Total assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $36,152PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is one of the biggest utility companies in the U.S. providing electricity and natural gas to more than 5 million households in California. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) was forced to enter bankruptcy after regulations prevented it from raising prices even though costs, due to multiple reasons, rose drastically. It was then rescued by the Californian government with the entire fiasco costing PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) around $45 billion.11. Thornburg MortgageTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $36,521Most of the biggest bankruptcies in American history occurred due to the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009, and Thornburg Mortgage is part of this list, with the real estate investment trust becoming illiquid due to the subprime mortgage crisis.10. Chrysler LLCTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $39,300A subsidiary of Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), Chrysler is considered to be among the biggest automakers in the U.S. Because of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, the company filed for bankruptcy in April 2009 with virtually all of the company's assets being transferred to Chrysler LLC to manage the debts while the government provided financing to the original company worth $8 billion.9. MF Global Holdings LtdTotal assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $40,541The global derivates broker started being plagued by liquidity issues and fine and penalties in 2008, which eventually led to it declaring bankruptcy in 2011.8. Energy Future Holdings Corp.Total assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $40,970The electric company was bought by multiple private equity firms in 2007, and due to gas prices falling instead of the expected increase, it filed for bankruptcy in 2014.7. Conseco Inc.Total assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $61,392Conseco was the third biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history as of 2002. With debts piling for the company and its accounting practices coming into question Conseco filed for bankruptcy in December 2002.6. Enron Corp.Total assets of the company at the time of bankruptcy (in millions): $65,503The Enron Corp scandal is one of the biggest scandals in American history, mainly due to the size of the corporation it ended up bringing down. Please click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Bankruptcies in American History.Suggested articles:15 Biggest Banks in the WorldTop Manufacturing Companies in the US15 Companies That Accept Bitcoin as PaymentDisclosure: None. 15 largest bankruptcies in American history is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:NFLX) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 31% in the last quarter. But that's small comfort given the dismal price performance over the last year. Like an arid lake in a warming world, shareholder value has evaporated, with the share price down 56% in that time. The share price recovery is not so impressive when you consider the fall. It may be that the fall was an overreaction.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Netflix In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Netflix had to report a 0.5% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 56% is actually more than the EPS drop. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Netflix's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Netflix shareholders are down 56% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 19%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

Uber and Netflix were ranked among the top 5 most popular hedge fund longs for the first time.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a news conference in Berlin, Germany February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschMega-cap technology giants continue to dominate the list of most popular top hedge fund holdings even as Big Tech has seen a severe drawdown this year amid rising interest rates.Federal Reserve officials have worked to rein in inflation by raising interest rates aggressively in 2022, with the central bank announcing a cumulative 3.75% increase in its benchmark interest rate range so far this year. Higher rates have dampened the growth outlook and challenge valuations in the tech sector.Meta Platforms (META), which is down 66% this year and among the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500, fell out of the top five among top hedge fund holdings for the first time since 2014.Goldman’s hedge fund “VIP” basket is comprised of the 50 stocks that appear most often among the top 10 holdings of fundamental hedge funds, which have roughly $1.5 trillion worth of long equity positions. Goldman Sachs compiled its latest report from 13F filings as of Nov. 13.This basket has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 58% of quarters since 2001, with an average excess return of 34 basis points across the winning quarters, Goldman's data shows.This year, however, the “VIP” list is down nearly 30% year-to-date compared to a 16% decline in the S&amp;P 500.

For example, in July Marvel’s latest Thor movie underperformed at the international box office due to not receiving release dates in China.While Disney did not reveal the budget of the Avatar sequel, James Cameron, the director of the movie, cited that it has to be the third or fourth highest-grossing movie to break even. Being allowed to open up in China might allow the franchise movie to live up to past performance expectations.The first Avatar movie released in 2009 grossed nearly $2.9 billion worldwide, with $259 million coming from China, making it the highest-grossing movie of all time. It edged out “Avengers: Endgame” after a September 2022 rerelease as the movie added $73 million in ticket sales.The launch of the first Avatar movie sparked a boom in multiplex construction in China which allowed U.S.-based multiplex businesses like IMAX IMAX to solidify their businesses in China.Chinese theaters saw lines of up to six hours long for the Avatar movie. Before the movie, IMAX had 14 screens in China and currently has 800, with 200 more contracted to be built.The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteFurther, this will allow Disney, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to diversify its income source into high-growth markets and economies, which will fund its key growth drivers like Disney+.Story continuesDisney+ is facing significant competition in the streaming market from Netflix NFLX and Apple’s AAPL Apple TV+ and is spending huge capital to bring out original content to fight against stiff competition in an extremely saturated market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Disney Movie Release in China to Fund Disney+ BusinessDisney is focusing on its streaming service, which will cost the company capital in terms of content and marketing to fend off competition from Netflix and Apple.Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space and is enjoying the first mover’s advantage in the industry. Its solid content portfolio is a major growth driver.Since the launch of Apple TV+, several Apple original series and films have earned more than 240 awards and 950 nominations, including the acclaimed SAG Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Critics Choice Awards. These accolades are catching viewers’ attention and helping it to win market share from Netflix and Disney.In order to fight peers, we expect Disney will expand its Direct-to-Consumer spending by 12.5% year over year. As a result, Direct-to-Consumer operating loss is expected to be $4.88 billion for fiscal 2023 compared with $4 billion in fiscal 2022. The rising spending and losses are expected to keep consolidated margins under pressure.Also, Disney has an extremely leveraged balance sheet portraying that it is lending more money to grow business in a highly fragmented market. Total borrowings were $48.37 billion as of Oct 1, 2022, compared with $46.6 billion as of Jul 2, 2022. Disney’s debt balance compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $11.62 billion.All of this impacted the share price of Disney quite adversely. In the year-to-date period, its shares fell 36.2% compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s decline of 33.7%.Amid this, the release of the new Avatar movie in China is welcome news for the company. This will create a new revenue source for the company and help increase its top line in the coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

63,daa2d9fe-ae7b-3573-8ecc-6dd2c6b245f4,PSX,2022-11-25,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-141002138.html,1669299002,STORY,"['PSX', 'PFE']","[Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself.And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last. People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Popular (BPOP) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.55 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.08%. This compares to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 1.94% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 22.22%. Check Popular (BPOP) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.28% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.48% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 3.5%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.89% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stock is up an impressive 113% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 28% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since it's been a strong week for TJX Companies shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, TJX Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.3% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of TJX Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, TJX Companies' TSR for the last 5 years was 128%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that TJX Companies has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 15% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 18% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TJX Companies better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.TJX Companies is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

That would come in below both the 13.5% jump reported last year, and the 9.3% gain in 2020.Retailers, meanwhile, began running unusually early discounts this year to entice shoppers.Target Corp, Kohls Corp, and Amazon.com Inc ran so-called early Black Friday deals - the term for the day after the Thanksgiving holiday - that discounted toys and some other goods by as much as 50%.Those companies did not respond to comment for this story.Yet even with steep discounts, consumers will still have to spend more for popular products like a PJ Masks toy car or Mattel Inc's Mega Hauler semi-truck because prices have risen faster than promotions, according to data provided by DataWeave.Story continuesMattel did not respond to a request to comment.The attempts to lure shoppers comes as the closely-followed University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was revised up Wednesday to up to 56.8 from 54.7, beating the consensus expectation of 55.0 but still below the 59.9 index level from October. Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.Retailers have struggled to shift their offerings as consumers fully emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, leaving some companies bogged down with excess inventory.Walmart Inc, for instance, lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices. Target, meanwhile, forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.Shares of Walmart are up 7.5% for the month to date, while shares of Target are down 1.2%.Department store Macy's Inc raised its annual profit forecast last week. Shares of the company are up nearly 12% month-to-date. Kohl's, meanwhile, withdrew its forecast as it faces weakening demand due to rising prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7% month-to-date.Walmart, Macy's and Kohl's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by David Randall Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times haven't been advantageous for General Dynamics as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics peKeen to find out how analysts think General Dynamics' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For General Dynamics?General Dynamics' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.5% gain to the company's bottom line. However, due to its less than impressive performance prior to this period, EPS growth is practically non-existent over the last three years overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that General Dynamics' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From General Dynamics' P/E?It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that General Dynamics maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for General Dynamics   you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of General Dynamics' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

68,ff961c9c-55df-3902-a8cb-7bf04ed6303d,ZTS,2022-11-25,Calculating The Fair Value Of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-zoetis-inc-120107882.html,1669377667,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Zoetis The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.37bUS$2.78bUS$2.91bUS$3.17bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.67bUS$3.80bUS$3.91bUS$4.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.87%Est @ 4%Est @ 3.4%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.2kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$100bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$100b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$55bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$79b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$150, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Zoetis, there are three relevant factors you should further research:Risks: You should be aware of the 1 warning sign for Zoetis we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does ZTS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:NEE) stock in the last 12 months were richly rewarded last week. The company's market value increased by US$5.1b as a result of the stock's 3.1% gain over the same period. As a result, their original purchase of US$6.5m worth of stock is now worth US$7.3m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider James Robo bought US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$84.92. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for NextEra Energy share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.In the last twelve months NextEra Energy insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own.

Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NextEra Energy shares in the last quarter.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency exchange platform industry, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Cryptocurrency Exchanges in the World.Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, or trade digital assets in exchange for other assets, such as fiat currencies or other digital currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized, where there is an entity that manages the platform and holds the user's assets, or decentralized, where the platform is run by the users themselves. Cryptocurrency exchanges typically charge a fee for each transaction and facilitate the buying, selling, or trading of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.Crypto's ""Lehman Moment""Sam Bankman-Fried is an MIT graduate, former billionaire, and former CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas that is now filing for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and quickly grew it to one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world through strategic M&amp;A and collaborations. The business was booming for FTX and the company had gained the attention of leading financial institutions including Blackrock, Tiger Global Management, and Sequoia Capital. FTX also engaged in aggressive marketing strategies and had celebrities including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, and Stephen Curry invest in and promote its platform.On November 2, CoinDesk published an article that triggered a chain reaction, bringing FTX and Alameda Research to file for chapter 11. Alameda Research, also founded and led by Sam Bankman-Fried, is a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. According to the company's balance sheet, Alameda Research had $14.6 billion worth of assets, a majority of which was FTT tokens. FTT tokens are minted by FTX, and compared to other cryptocurrencies, have little transparency which makes them difficult to track and regulate. When Alameda's balance sheet was disclosed, on November 6, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, announced that Binance will sell all its FTT tokens. This caused the price of FTT to tank significantly and resulted in the insolvency of Alameda Research. On November 8, Binance announced that it would acquire FTX to pull it out of bankruptcy. However, on November 9, Binance backed out of the deal citing the mishandling of consumers' funds by FTX to be the reason. On November 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX used billions of dollars of clients' funds to place risky bets via Alameda Research. Both FTX and Alameda Research have now filed for bankruptcy and the exchange's implosion has wiped out $152 billion from the world's 15 largest cryptocurrencies' market value. The Financial Times has called this event ""crypto's Lehman moment"".Story continuesThe Cryptocurrency Exchange Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency exchange industry was worth $30.18 billion in 2021. The industry is expected to reach a value of $37.07 billion by the end of 2022 and then grow to $264.32 billion by the end of 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate of 27.8% from 2022 to 2030.  This growth is primarily attributed to the rising acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are expected to fuel the demand for cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Moreover, investments in the research and development of blockchain technology are expected to further advance the growth of the global cryptocurrency exchange platform industry.End-use-wise, the commercial segment dominated the global cryptocurrency exchange market and held a 68.20% revenue share in 2021. This is attributed to the fact that a majority of financial institutions and businesses are becoming inclined towards offering crypto trading services on their own platforms and are exploring strategic collaborations with prominent cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Some of the top financial services companies that are prominent backers of blockchain technology and are exploring collaborations with cryptocurrency exchange platforms include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Moreover, the personal-use segment is expected to grow at the fastest compound annual growth rate through the forecasted period, due to an influx of crypto traders from emerging markets.Region-wise, North America held the dominant market share and accounted for over 29% of the global cryptocurrency exchange market's revenue in 2021. However, the APAC region is expected to grow at the fastest rate through the forecasted period due to the rising popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies in emerging markets, for instance, China and India.According to CoinMarketCap, as of November 23, 2022, there are over 21,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation that hold a total market capitalization of more than $824.8 billion and have a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $60.12 billion.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Mastercard with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Mastercard Mastercard's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Mastercard grew its EPS by 15% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Mastercard shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 54% to 57% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Mastercard's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Mastercard, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$343m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Mastercard Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Mastercard is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing.

74,e74dbb6f-947c-30aa-9bd2-11c43f8dfa90,QCOM,2022-11-25,Here's What We Like About QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-qualcomms-nasdaq-qcom-upcoming-102136635.html,1669371696,STORY,['QCOM'],"[QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase QUALCOMM's shares before the 30th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.00 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, QUALCOMM has a trailing yield of approximately 2.4% on its current stock price of $125.15. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether QUALCOMM has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. QUALCOMM paid out just 25% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 47% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see QUALCOMM's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 48% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, QUALCOMM has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineShould investors buy QUALCOMM for the upcoming dividend? QUALCOMM has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. QUALCOMM looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while QUALCOMM has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for QUALCOMM that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

75,ac005bb9-e0be-3240-9988-49a85be95c60,PHM,2022-11-25,Bear of the Day: PulteGroup (PHM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-pultegroup-phm-110811331.html,1669374491,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup, Inc. PHM is facing a challenging housing market in 2023. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a big earnings decline next year as housing slows further.PulteGroup is the nation's third largest homebuilder. It operates in 24 states and in over 40 major markets. It's brands include Centex, Pulte, Del Webb, DiVosta, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.It's sales consist of 32% first-time buyers, 43% to move up and 25% active adult. It's Del Webb and DiVosta brands are there to serve the baby boomers as they head towards retirement.An Earnings Miss in the Third QuarterOn Oct 25, 2022, PulteGroup reported its third quart results and posted a rare earnings miss. Earnings were $2.69 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $2.73, or a $0.04 miss.This was only the second earnings miss in the last 5 years, with the other one in 2021.Revenue was up 16% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 15% increase in the average sales price of homes closed to $545,000, along with a 1% increase in closings to 7,047 homes.Gross margins also rose by 360 basis points year-over-year to 30.1% from 26.5%.Unit backlog totaled 17,053 homes, down 14% from a year ago. The backlog value rose 3% to $10.6 billion.Given the changing market conditions due to rising mortgage rates, PulteGroup elected to terminate a number of pending land transactions and wrote off $24 million of deposits and preacquisition expenses associated with the deals.Analysts Cutting Earnings Estimates for 2022 and 2023PulteGroup's headline report looks solid because they are still delivering out of their big backlog from before rates rose.But analysts have been cutting estimates over the last 30 days.In the last month, 6 estimates were lowered for 2022 which pushed down the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $10.15 from $11.21 90 days ago.That is still earnings growth of 39% compared to 2021, when PulteGroup made $7.30.4 estimates were also cut for 2023, but one was raised, in the last month as well. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $7.09 from $9.98 in the last 90 days. That's down 30% from 2022's hot market.Value or Value Trap?PulteGroup shares are down 20.3% year-to-date which is worse than the S&amp;P 500, which has fallen 15.8%. But with mortgage rates jumping over 7%, it's not surprising that investors have jumped out of the homebuilder stocks this year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares are dirt cheap. PulteGroup has a forward P/E of just 4.3. But with those earnings expected to decline sharply next year, that makes it a value trap.PulteGroup does pay a dividend, which currently yields 1.4%. It also has a share repurchase program. In the third quarter, it repurchased 4.4 million shares, or 2% of its common shares, for $180 million.With mortgage rates remaining elevated, and a possible recession looming, it may be too early to dive back into the homebuilders.

76,0168c630-dc00-3e24-8d00-6bb769028f06,PHM,2022-11-25,Why Is PulteGroup (PHM) Up 15% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pultegroup-phm-15-since-163104985.html,1669307464,STORY,['PHM'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for PulteGroup (PHM). Shares have added about 15% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PulteGroup due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PulteGroup (PHM) Misses on Q3 Earnings &amp; RevenuesPulteGroup Inc. reported unimpressive results in third-quarter 2022. Quarterly earnings and revenues missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate thanks to prevailing industry headwinds.Nonetheless, the metrics increased on a year-over-year basis.Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup’s president and CEO, stated, “While we reported significant growth in our third quarter earnings, demand clearly slowed in the period as dramatically higher interest rates created financial and psychological hurdles for potential homebuyers,” said Marshall. “In response to today’s more challenging market conditions, we continue to adjust our sales, construction and investment practices as we work to turn inventory and balance our housing starts to appropriately match the pace of sales.”Inside the HeadlinesEarnings per share came in at $2.69, missing the consensus mark of $2.73 by 1.5% but increasing 47.8% from $1.82 per share a year ago. The upside was driven by gains in revenues, improved gross margin and overhead leverage.Total revenues of $3.94 billion also missed the consensus mark of $4.04 billion by 2.5% but increased 13.4% from the year-ago figure of $3.48 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments — Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 14.3% year over year to $3.87 billion. Home sale revenues of $3.84 billion increased 16% year over year, mainly due to the higher average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues declined 51.4% from a year ago to $30.7 million.The number of homes closed increased 1% from the year-ago level to 7,047 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $545,000, up 15% year over year.Importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 17,053 units, down 14% year over year. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $10.58 billion.However, new home orders dropped 28% year over year to 4,924 units for the quarter, owing to several headwinds like rising mortgage rates, lower affordability, lower consumer confidence and slowed demand. This resulted in a cancelation rate of 24%, up from 10% in the prior year period and 15% in the second quarter of 2022. Home orders were down across all operating regions served. The value of new orders also slipped 8.3% from a year ago to $2.81 billion.MarginsHome sales gross margin was up 360 bps year over year to 30.1% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew 410 bps year over year to 21%. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved to 9.1% from 9.6% a year ago.Revenues from the Financial Services segment declined 20.5% year over year to $72.7 million. Pretax income for the segment decreased to $27.5 million from $48.6 million a year ago. The decline was due to a reduction in loan volumes owing to a fall in capture rate to 77% compared with 85% last year and the more competitive pricing environment.Story continuesFinancialsAt September-end, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) were $291.4 million, down from $1.83 billion in 2021 end. Debt to total capital of 22.5% at third-quarter end was down from 21.3% at 2021 end.In the third quarter, the company repurchased 4.4 million common shares for $180 million at an average price of $41.20 per share.Q4 GuidancePulteGroup expects ASP within $560,000-$570,000, indicating an increase from $490,000 registered a year ago. It expects home deliveries to be 8,000, indicating a decline from 8,611 homes delivered a year ago. The decrease reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on Florida operations.PHM expects homebuilding gross margins to expand 120 bps to 28% for fourth-quarter 2022 from the year-ago period.The company remains on track for full year SG&amp;A (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -22.22% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, PulteGroup has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise PulteGroup has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Companies with consistent revenue and earnings tend to be more stable and help significantly lower risk during volatile market conditions. They are a great way to diversify your portfolio and protect your investments during market turbulence. You can find safe havens by looking for companies with a history of consistent growth, strong financials, and a history of paying dividends.Given the current market conditions, investors must carefully monitor their exposure to risk and make sure that their portfolios are diversified. The stock market has taken a hammering this year, and several high-value stocks have plunged to record lows. Many safe havens are now trading at reasonable valuations and can allow investors to marginalize their risk in the current downturn. With that said, let’s look at seven safe havens you should gain exposure to in the current market downturn.SymbolCompanyPriceKOCoca-Cola$61.14JPMJPMorgan Chase$133.84JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$176.20AAPLApple$151.29KHCKraft Heinz$38.10SQMSociedad Quimica Y Minera$90.23MMIMarcus &amp; Millichap$36.20Coca-Cola (KO)KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of iceSource: monticello / ShutterstockSome stocks are more reliable than others, and few companies are more reliable than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Its products are in demand regardless of season or economic conditions. Hence, it’s ideal for those looking for more stability in their portfolio. And while its share price may not always rise rapidly, it is unlikely to drop dramatically either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPerhaps its greatest strength is its pricing power, which is especially relevant in the current inflationary environment. Moreover, the firm has a fortress of a balance sheet, with more than $10 billion in its cash till. The diversity of its product offerings has helped its revenue and earnings growth, reducing dependency on its flagship carbonated beverages. More importantly, it’s a dividend king for investors, having increased its payout for the last 59 consecutive years.Story continuesJPMorgan Chase (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the largest bank in the world, and its third-quarter earnings report demonstrates the company’s strength. JPMorgan reports that consumers and businesses are holding up remarkably well despite the challenges. This is good news for investors, as the current market downturn is unlikely to impact the bank’s stellar dividend profile. It yields nearly 3%, which should keep them ahead of long-term inflation.JPM boasts a wide moat built from technical efficiency, effective capital expenditure management, and cost advantages. It maintains an integrated set of financial franchises that operate powerful product lines providing massive scope and scale for the business. Moreover, the firm is poised to benefit from rising interest rates, making it a sound investment in the financial space. JPM stock is well-positioned to weather any challenges that may arise in the future.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the world’s largest pharma business offering investors a growing dividend and healthy incremental upside. Its company has grown its top line by single-digit margins over the past several years, making it one of the most stable businesses in its niche. Sales of its coronavirus vaccine and related products brought in a ton of money for the firm, positioning it incredibly well for the future.In ushering in the next era of growth for the business, JNJ is focused on picking up other pharma companies. Moreover, it’s focused on spinning off its consumer business and growing sales from its pharmaceutical division to a spectacular $60 billion by 2025. Given its track record in the past, I would bet on JNJ to continue growing its business at a healthy pace for the foreseeable future. Also, the stock yields a robust 2.75% dividend yield, which makes it a stellar investment in the space.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sits at the Mount Rushmore of tech companies, with a market cap of over $2.2 trillion. With iconic products like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook, Apple has cemented itself as a leader in the tech industry. Thanks to its innovative products, strong brand loyalty, and incredible marketing efforts, there’s no doubt that Apple remains the pick of the tech stocks at this time.While its competitors have faltered in the current economic environment, the tech giant continues to post extraordinary results. It generated a record $90.1 billion in sales last quarter, with iPhone sales jumping almost 10% year-over-year. Hence, AAPL is an ideal choice for investors for its stability in an otherwise volatile market. Also, it offers a dividend of 23 cents which its management continues to grow at a healthy pace each year. With multiple growth catalysts in motion in fintech, streaming, advertising, and whatnot, AAPL stock is a no-brainer investment.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comKraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is an ideal investment for those looking for safe consumer staples stocks. The company owns several recognizable brands, including HP Brands, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer, and others. These brands have strong pricing power, which enables Kraft Heinz to continue growing its dividend even in tough economic times. In addition, the company has a history of conservative financial management, which has helped it weather periods of market turmoil.Though it faces substantial headwinds, its business has proven to be remarkably resilient, exhibiting strong pricing power. Moreover, its EBITDA and net income margins are at a stellar 19.1% and 4.7% for the trailing-twelve months. Hence, Kraft Heinz is an attractive investment for risk-averse investors seeking exposure to the consumer staples sector.Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM)Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stockSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSociedad Quimica Y Minera (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean mining giant involved in producing potassium, lithium, and other chemicals and minerals. Its lithium segment, in particular, has witnessed robust demand on the back of the rampant growth in the electric vehicles industry. The low-cost producer has increased its output at a superb pace to position itself as a juggernaut in the space. Also, it offers a generous 6.6% dividend yield to investors.2022 has been an incredible year for the business, where lithium prices have risen rapidly to new heights. Consequently, SQM and its peers have posted record earnings in recent quarters. SQM recently posted its third quarter results, where its sales increased by a whopping 347.4% from the prior-year period. Moreover, net income for the nine months that ended in September shot up by 944%.

78,5fb99d5b-e6ce-384d-b624-4619eb205455,GT,2022-11-25,7 Stocks Ready to Soar After Flattening at Lows,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-ready-soar-flattening-005108418.html,1669078268,STORY,"['LITE', 'COUP', 'FVRR', 'GT', 'MDB', 'DOCU']","[Value investors seeking the best stocks to buy may use a company’s 52-week low as a key metric to consider. Stock Rover’s screener provides a simple-to-use option for investors to find such stocks which have traded at those lows within the last 15 days. After running the initial stock screener, and answering the “who” question, investors should ask “why” next.Stocks that are temporarily down on their luck tend to provide a greater chance of seeing above-average gains. However, such companies need to see marked improvements for such gains to be realized. Thus, whether these are beaten-down stocks to buy, or value traps to avoid, relies on what these companies do to fix their sometimes-broken business models.Investors looking at these stocks need to critically assess the management teams which have driven poor results. Very often, the executives at such companies are overly optimistic. They will not say anything negative against the company. That’s because doing so may only hurt the stock price further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to BuyThese stocks have low sentiment scores as investors ignore them.Chart courtesy of StockRoverThe chart above lists stocks that traded at a 52-week low in the last 15 days. Additionally, each of these stocks trades at an average price above $4.00 a share. These companies could have issued a poor outlook, reported a weaker quarter, or simply trades at too high a valuation. In either case, each of these are stocks to buy for those looking for turnaround stories right now.AAPAdvanced Auto Parts$147.69COUPCoupa Software$44.94DOCUDocuSign$43.56FVRRFiverr$35.00GTGoodyear Tire &amp; Rubber$10.75LITELumentum Holdings$54.82MDBMongoDB$146.10Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockLet’s start our list of flattened stocks to buy with Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP), a provider of after-market parts for the automotive sector. This company serves both do-it-yourself and professional customers.Story continuesRecently, AAP stock continued its decline, falling after disappointing third-quarter earnings. The company revenue of $2.6 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis. Management also lowered their revenue guidance for 2022, to the range of $11 billion to $11.2 billion.Fearful investors anticipate a weaker economy will hurt auto parts sales. That said, I think these investors are missing out on the potential for shares to soar. In an internal deep dive, the company identified its underperformance in the Professional category. Advanced Auto Parts has the opportunity to move its inventory closer to the customer. This will improve product availability and will speed up its inventory turnover.As the company spends more time with its suppliers to focus on key categories, I expect margins to expand. In 2023, Advanced Auto Parts will add more products that customers must have. This will increase sales volumes. In addition, in-house products will contribute positively to the company’s profitability.Coupa Software (COUP)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockCoupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) provides a cloud platform for business spend management (“BSM”). While I think this is among the beaten-up stocks to buy, the market doesn’t agree. Coupa has been penalized due to broader economic worries around a potential recession on the horizon. Despite the prices of goods rising, customers must increase business spending in areas that matter. They will need Coupa’s solutions to manage those transactions.Coupa needs to win back investor confidence. It must demonstrate to shareholders that the sales cycle is not elongated. Furthermore, I expect the company to refinance its convertible debt at favorable interest rates.Coupa’s competitors do not have as strong a position in the mid-sized enterprise market. Additionally, I expect the company to manage a relatively weak sales cycle in Europe by engaging more closely with its customers. For example, Coupa may work more closely with European customers on transformation projects.In North America, investors should expect Coupa’s strong scalable mid-market business to thrive. In this post-Covid environment, corporations may only see a minimal business slowdown. Thus, I expect many will renew their Coupa service contracts in 2023.DocuSign (DOCU)Docusign (DOCU) logo on buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) offers e-signature solutions for enterprise clientele. Notably, I think this is a company with many catalysts on the horizon.One catalyst investors should watch is the potential for Docusing to increase the length of its client contracts. This is because the strong digitization trend allows for the acceleration of business processes (i.e. productivity increases) which will become much more valuable in a slowing economy.Recently, DOCU stock bottomed at around $40. It now trades at a more reasonable price-to-sales ratio of 3.39 times. At this more attractive valuation, I think a larger software company that wants to strengthen its e-signature offerings might acquire DocuSign. Investors who hold shares at these levels will earn a high return on investment if that happens.The economic slowdown will hurt some sectors more than others. Real estate transactions will fall as mortgage affordability falls. That will hurt DocuSign’s business in this sector. Conversely, the company will sharpen its focus on marketing its solution in other markets. Companies will value the reduced friction that their customers face through a digital signature process flow.Fiverr International (FVRR)The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.Source: Temitiman / Shutterstock.comFiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) is a global online marketplace for freelance services. In the third quarter, Fiverr reported revenue growth of 11.0%, posting $82.5 million for its top line. For 2022, the company expects revenue of up to $340.0 million.The company achieved higher sales per existing buyer by identifying an opportunity to increase active buyer spending in the quarter. Markets are stabilizing, but layoffs are picking up. For Fiverr, this could be a good thing, as more free agents on the market means more supply for the company. Thus, the economy’s loss could be Fiverr’s gain.Additionally, customers searching for specific freelance services will increase. As demand rises, Fiverr’s revenue and operating profits are likely to strengthen. Historically, a short-term slowdown benefited its business. For example, during the Covid lockdown, supply increased, and as corporations rushed to invest in services, demand rose accordingly.I think Fiverr’s business model remain in high demand in the year ahead. This is a company that is well-positioned to help its customers find staff that may perform more complicated, larger projects. Accordingly, the attractiveness of Fiverr’s marketplace for corporate customers will only get more attractive from here.Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT)Interesting Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (GT) Put and Call OptionsSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comInvestors have been in selling mode with Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) after the company posted its third-quarter results. The tire supplier posted revenue of $5.31 billion, but showed weakness during the quarter. This was mainly due to two headwinds – increased inventory and stronger competition.Goodyear also had higher raw material and energy costs. Thus, the company was unable to pass all inflationary pressures onto customers. In addition, labor costs rose. In North America, the company could potentially offset such costs. However, at a total company level, those factors eroded its profitability.In the automotive marketplace, Goodyear performed well in the light truck market, in addition to strong performance in other key segments. However, the company has factories that operate in higher-cost locations compared to its competitors. Thus, this cost disadvantage is notable, as Goodyear’s customers are more sensitive to higher prices as their disposable income falls.That said, I think GT stock has a good chance of rebounding quickly. The company has eliminated its excess capacity in the quarter, improving its competitive position by leveraging its production outside of Europe.Lumentum Holdings (LITE)Focus so desired Steel roller with fiber optic cables for the installation of data cables on a construction site., OCC makes fiber cables like theseSource: John-Fs-Pic / Shutterstock.comLumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE) manufactures optical and photonic products. Like other names on this list, LITE stock fell when it posted its fiscal second-quarter results. While revenue grew by 13.0% to $506.8 million, its outlook for the current quarter came in weaker than expected. For the full year, the company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.45.Ongoing supply shortages had the biggest impact on its results. This will likely continue into its fiscal 2024 year. Accordingly, investors who accumulate shares at a discount should expect a rally after the shortage ends. In addition, weaker sales of 3D sensing solutions from hyperscaler customers are temporary. Once demand rebounds, Lumentum will raise its outlook.In the company’s telecom sector, I expect demand to remain strong. Additionally, Lumentum’s commercial lasers business should continue to thrive. Lumentum will thus have to play catch up to fulfill demand.In its data center business, Lumentum has seen weaker demand affect inventories. That said, once chip supplies come into equilibrium, higher orders in the quarters to come should help the company raise its outlook, boosting its valuation.MongoDB (MDB)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockLast on our list of stocks to buy is database software provider MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). The company continues to offer agile solutions and real-time analytics. I expect customers to sustain their investments in technology that gives them an edge.MongoDB is trading at a discount because its growth is slowing. Revenue growth could slow to the high teens in the fourth quarter, compared to a 55% growth rate in the first half of the year. However, the company’s MongoDB Atlas product has the potential to sustain growth of nearly 75%. In addition, its Enterprise Advanced product lets customers run MongoDB on their own. Customers who need security and efficiency may allocate their technology budget here.Investors should bet on MongoDB winning new customers in the medium- to long-term. The company is in the very early stages of growing its market share. Thus, I think its share price will rise alongside increases in new customers in the coming quarters through its direct sales channel.The weakening macroeconomic environment will encourage organizations to build applications with fewer resources.

(NYSE:RSG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-republic-services-164636490.html,1669308396.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[Does the November share price for Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Republic Services What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.81bUS$2.00bUS$2.02bUS$2.10bUS$2.16bUS$2.22bUS$2.27bUS$2.33bUS$2.38bUS$2.43bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.21%Est @ 2.14% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$136, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Republic Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.005. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

80,9f7822e3-6991-38f1-8229-9d373a7cdce3,MOS,2022-11-25,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Could Be A Buy For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-could-buy-103111178.html,1669372271,STORY,['MOS'],"[The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Mosaic's shares before the 30th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.60 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Mosaic has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current stock price of $50.6. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Mosaic is paying out just 3.6% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 6.1% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that Mosaic's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Mosaic's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 67% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Mosaic looks like a promising growth company.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Mosaic has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Mosaic? It's great that Mosaic is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. Mosaic looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Mosaic is facing. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Mosaic and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Nike gained 4% during the same period, beating the S&amp;P 500's 1% gain.In its quarterly conference call on Nov. 9, Adidas said it expects sales of about 400 euros ($415 million) related to the World Cup, which would amount to around 2% of additional annual revenue.Mexico jerseys are among Adidas' current best sellers, an Adidas spokesperson said.Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the importance of the World Cup on its sales.While soccer-related merchandise accounts for a fraction of both Adidas and Nike's overall businesses, hype around the World Cup and team jerseys can provide a halo effect driving sales of other kinds of merchandise, said Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic.""If somebody in Germany buys a World Cup jersey, do they also buy a new pair shoes? Or if an Adidas sponsored team wins the whole thing, in the euphoria of winning the World Cup, do people buy more jerseys than they otherwise would have? That's where you can see some variability,"" Nikic said.Nike is providing jerseys for 13 teams in this World Cup, including Brazil, France and the United States, overtaking Adidas as the leader in World Cup jerseys.

It delivers tiny lipid particles containing mRNA instructions for cells to create replicas of so-called hemagglutinin proteins that appear on influenza virus surfaces.A universal vaccine would not mean an end to flu seasons, but would replace the guess work that goes into developing annual shots months ahead of flu season each year.""The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs,"" study leader Scott Hensley of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said in a statement.Unlike standard flu vaccines that deliver one or two versions of hemagglutinin, the experimental vaccine includes 20 different types in the hope of getting the immune system to recognize any flu virus it might encounter in the future.In lab experiments, vaccinated animals' immune systems recognized the hemagglutinin proteins and defended against 18 different strains of influenza A and two strains of influenza B. Antibody levels induced by the vaccine remained unchanged for at least four months, according to a report published in the journal Science.The vaccine reduced signs of illness and protected from death even when the ferrets were exposed to a different type of flu not in the vaccine, the researchers said.Moderna and Pfizer both have mRNA flu vaccines in late-stage human trials, and GSK and partner CureVac are testing an mRNA flu vaccine in an early-stage safety trial in humans. These vaccines are designed to defend against only four recently-circulating influenza strains but could theoretically be changed up each year.Story continuesThe universal flu vaccine, if successful in human trials, would not necessarily prevent infection. The goal is to provide durable protection against severe disease and death, Hensley said.Questions remain regarding how to judge efficacy and potential regulatory requirements for a vaccine against possible future viruses that are not currently circulating, Alyson Kelvin and Darryl Falzarano of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, wrote in a commentary published with the study.While the promising results with the new vaccine ""suggest a protective capacity against all subtypes of influenza viruses, we cannot be sure until clinical trials in volunteers are done,"" Adolfo García-Sastrem, director of the Institute for Global Health and Emerging Pathogens at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said in a statement.

People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Popular (BPOP) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.55 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.08%. This compares to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 1.94% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 22.22%. Check Popular (BPOP) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.28% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.48% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 3.5%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.89% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Pfizer How Fast Is Pfizer Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Pfizer has grown EPS by 23% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Pfizer shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 32% to 40%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Pfizer?Are Pfizer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$274b company like Pfizer. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$104m.

89,65195cec-9c32-3e49-809c-92dff5ee8d25,PYPL,2022-11-25,PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock falls 5.7% in past week as one-year earnings and shareholder returns continue downward trend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-nasdaq-pypl-stock-130254576.html,1669381374,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Investing in stocks comes with the risk that the share price will fall. Unfortunately, shareholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) have suffered share price declines over the last year. The share price has slid 57% in that time. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 25% in the last three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 13% in the last 90 days. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.After losing 5.7% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately PayPal Holdings reported an EPS drop of 53% for the last year. This proportional reduction in earnings per share isn't far from the 57% decrease in the share price. Given the lower EPS we might have expected investors to lose confidence in the stock, but that doesn't seemed to have happened. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of PayPal Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, PayPal Holdings shareholders did even worse, losing 57%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with PayPal Holdings .Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency exchange platform industry, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Cryptocurrency Exchanges in the World.Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, or trade digital assets in exchange for other assets, such as fiat currencies or other digital currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized, where there is an entity that manages the platform and holds the user's assets, or decentralized, where the platform is run by the users themselves. Cryptocurrency exchanges typically charge a fee for each transaction and facilitate the buying, selling, or trading of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.Crypto's ""Lehman Moment""Sam Bankman-Fried is an MIT graduate, former billionaire, and former CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas that is now filing for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and quickly grew it to one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world through strategic M&amp;A and collaborations. The business was booming for FTX and the company had gained the attention of leading financial institutions including Blackrock, Tiger Global Management, and Sequoia Capital. FTX also engaged in aggressive marketing strategies and had celebrities including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, and Stephen Curry invest in and promote its platform.On November 2, CoinDesk published an article that triggered a chain reaction, bringing FTX and Alameda Research to file for chapter 11. Alameda Research, also founded and led by Sam Bankman-Fried, is a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. According to the company's balance sheet, Alameda Research had $14.6 billion worth of assets, a majority of which was FTT tokens. FTT tokens are minted by FTX, and compared to other cryptocurrencies, have little transparency which makes them difficult to track and regulate. When Alameda's balance sheet was disclosed, on November 6, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, announced that Binance will sell all its FTT tokens. This caused the price of FTT to tank significantly and resulted in the insolvency of Alameda Research. On November 8, Binance announced that it would acquire FTX to pull it out of bankruptcy. However, on November 9, Binance backed out of the deal citing the mishandling of consumers' funds by FTX to be the reason. On November 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX used billions of dollars of clients' funds to place risky bets via Alameda Research. Both FTX and Alameda Research have now filed for bankruptcy and the exchange's implosion has wiped out $152 billion from the world's 15 largest cryptocurrencies' market value. The Financial Times has called this event ""crypto's Lehman moment"".Story continuesThe Cryptocurrency Exchange Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency exchange industry was worth $30.18 billion in 2021. The industry is expected to reach a value of $37.07 billion by the end of 2022 and then grow to $264.32 billion by the end of 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate of 27.8% from 2022 to 2030.  This growth is primarily attributed to the rising acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are expected to fuel the demand for cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Moreover, investments in the research and development of blockchain technology are expected to further advance the growth of the global cryptocurrency exchange platform industry.End-use-wise, the commercial segment dominated the global cryptocurrency exchange market and held a 68.20% revenue share in 2021. This is attributed to the fact that a majority of financial institutions and businesses are becoming inclined towards offering crypto trading services on their own platforms and are exploring strategic collaborations with prominent cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Some of the top financial services companies that are prominent backers of blockchain technology and are exploring collaborations with cryptocurrency exchange platforms include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Moreover, the personal-use segment is expected to grow at the fastest compound annual growth rate through the forecasted period, due to an influx of crypto traders from emerging markets.Region-wise, North America held the dominant market share and accounted for over 29% of the global cryptocurrency exchange market's revenue in 2021. However, the APAC region is expected to grow at the fastest rate through the forecasted period due to the rising popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies in emerging markets, for instance, China and India.According to CoinMarketCap, as of November 23, 2022, there are over 21,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation that hold a total market capitalization of more than $824.8 billion and have a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $60.12 billion. Currently, there are more than 500 operational cryptocurrency exchanges.

Shares have added about 12.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NCR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.NCR Corporation Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales MissNCR delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 bottom-line results. The company’s third-quarter non-GAAP earnings jumped 16% year over year to 80 cents per share and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Increased revenues mainly drove the company’s bottom line higher. Additionally, the pricing and cost actions described in April this year were accretive to the company’s third-quarter bottom line. However, the strong U.S. dollar reduced non-GAAP earnings by 12 cents per share.For the third quarter of 2022, the company reported revenues of $1.97 billion, missing the consensus mark of $2 billion. However, the top line witnessed year-over-year growth of 4%, driven by strong execution and solid growth across the company’s business segments except Other.However, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflationary pressure and rising interest rates remained headwinds. Unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted third-quarter revenues by approximately $78 million. NCR stated that the third-quarter top line grew 8% on a constant currency basis.Additionally, NCR stated that supply-chain challenges, though have started to ease, are causing uneven revenue generation and increased investments in working capital.NCR progressed significantly with its strategic growth initiatives, which are transforming it into a software platform and payments company. The company’s recurring revenues improved by 3% to $1.22 billion in the quarter under review.Story continuesSegment DetailsSince the first quarter of 2022, NCR changed its reporting segments to correspond with changes to its operating model, management structure and organizational responsibilities. The new reportable revenue segments are Payments &amp; Network, Digital Banking, Self-Service Banking, Retail and Hospitality.Payments &amp; Network revenues soared 11% to $336 million from the mere $304 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by merchant acquiring and higher-value transactions.NCR’s Digital Banking Solution revenues increased by 7% to $137 million. The strong quarterly performance was mainly driven by increased user counts, a CSP win at Citibank and continued success at Terrafina.In the third quarter, Self-Service Banking revenues marginally improved to $640 million from $637 million in the year-ago quarter.Retail revenues increased 6% to $575 million, mainly driven by a better product mix and pricing.Hospitality revenues climbed 6% to $238 million. The reopening of restaurants and business activities drove the segment’s revenues higher.Operating DetailsThe non-GAAP gross profit of $528 million was down 3.3% year over year. Moreover, the non-GAAP gross margin rate contracted 190 basis points (bps) to 26.8%.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 16% year over year to $279 million.Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year over year to $380 million, despite a negative impact of $22 million due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 80 bps to 19.3%.The non-GAAP operating income increased to $249 million from the year-ago quarter’s $215 million. The non-GAAP operating margin expanded 130 bps to 12.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s 11.3%.Balance Sheet &amp; Other DetailsNCR exited the September-end quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $434 million compared with the $398 million reported during the June-end quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $127 million in the third quarter. The free cash outflow was $28 million compared to the prior quarter’s cash inflow of $125 million.Reiterated FY22 GuidanceNCR reaffirmed its guidance for the full year of 2022, which it provided in the first-quarter earnings release. For the full-year 2022, NCR continues anticipating revenues of approximately $8 billion.The company projects adjusted EBITDA in the band of $1.4-$1.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings are still projected between $2.70 and $3.20 per share.For the fourth quarter, the company assumes to deliver similar results to the third quarter from revenue and profit perspectives while expecting a significant improvement in free cash flow.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -15.88% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, NCR has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise NCR has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNCR is part of the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry. Over the past month, IBM (IBM), a stock from the same industry, has gained 10.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.IBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%.IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

While we are closely monitoring the potential impact of these dynamics, industry demand remains robust, driven by strong consumer balance sheets and pent-up demand after multiple years of constrained production. We also remain confident in GM's ability to navigate a complex operating environment, which the company has consistently demonstrated over the past few years. Finally, the long-term picture remains bright. We believe GM is significantly undervalued, is well-positioned for the long-term transition to electric vehicles and has numerous needle-moving ancillary business opportunities (most notably Cruise, which is an industry leader in autonomous vehicle technology) that are underappreciated. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Pet Food Companies in the World25 Most Polluted Countries in the World15 Biggest Fintech Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

100,ab52fc64-62c9-3c4b-a266-3f8ce21bf180,MKC,2022-11-25,McCormick (MKC) Poised on Prudent Buyouts & Cost Savings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-mkc-poised-prudent-buyouts-154903204.html,1669304943,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V', 'GIS', 'LW']","[McCormick &amp; Company MKC is capitalizing on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands. The strategic buyouts and effective cost-saving plans of this global leader in flavors are yielding. These upsides aided McCormick’s third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing year over year.That being said, McCormick is not immune to rising inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions.Let’s discuss this in detail.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales Growth &amp; Bright ViewDuring third-quarter fiscal 2022, McCormick generated sales of $1,595.6 million, up 3%. Constant currency (cc) sales increased 6%, on 10% growth from pricing actions. During the third quarter, cc sales increased at a three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, relative to a pre-pandemic baseline of 2019. The upside reflects sustained momentum in the business. Sales increased across Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments.The company’s fiscal third-quarter sales performance reflects the strength of its broad global portfolio and the effective execution of its strategies despite a volatile operating environment. Its brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives continue to drive growth.For fiscal 2022, net sales are expected to increase 2% from fiscal 2021 levels and grow 3-5% at cc. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions and cost savings. These factors are likely to offset inflationary pressures over time.What Else is Driving McCormick’s Growth?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased its presence through acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The company bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. McCormick believes that the buyout of Cholula accelerates its growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.McCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to remain competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Aided by a sturdy brand image, McCormick enjoys strong retail acceptance for its new products. Additionally, the company is on track to augment robust marketing support for its products. New product launches are an important part of the company’s growth. Management is leveraging its broad technology platform to develop clean label, organic and better-for-you solutions amid rising consumer’s health consciousness.Story continuesHurdles on the WayMcCormick has been grappling with cost inflation for a while now. During third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s gross profit margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 35.5%, thanks to escalated cost inflation and other supply chain expenses. For 2022, management expects the adjusted gross profit margin to be down 350 to 300 bps year over year, mainly due to the Flavor Solutions segment. Adjusted operating income is likely to decline 13-11% (down 11-9% at cc) during the year.During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, McCormick continued to witness supply-chain-related issues. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that recovery of some constrained materials is taking longer than anticipated. The company continues to incur escalated expenses to meet increased demand across the Flavor Solutions segment. In addition, it is witnessing lower-than-optimal operating leverage in the Consumer unit.McCormick’s cost savings and the aforementioned upsides are likely to keep aiding growth. McCormick is focused on saving costs and enhancing productivity through the ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, leading to higher sales and profits. Management expects to achieve CCI-led cost savings of nearly $85 million in 2022.    MKC’s stock has increased 0.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7.6% growth.Looking for Other Food Stocks?

Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Anna Driver and Richard Chang)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 10 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks. As high-interest rates and inflation have pulled down the market this year, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors. The fears of possible recession have distressed investors regarding the falling value of their portfolios. Quarterly or monthly dividends are rewarding for investors as they can help them glide through these difficult times. Dividend Kings like 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) have outperformed the broader market this year so far, as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth track records. Moreover, their strong fundamentals and improving balance sheets help them smoothly manage and deliver shareholder returns.According to a recent report published by JPMorgan Asset Management, dividend stocks prop up the market during inflationary periods as strong companies avoid slashing their dividends even after reporting earnings decline. As dividends are still recovering from the ill effects of the pandemic of 2020, dividend payout ratios are currently at low levels, which is faring well for dividend companies and eventually for investors. The report sheds light on the performance of dividend stocks during previous inflations. It referred to the data by Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and JPMorgan Asset Management, mentioning that dividends represented 3.3%, 4.2%, and 4.4% of the total market returns during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, respectively. The report also concluded that dividends remain more stable than earnings when markets fall into a recession.Fidelity Investments also weighed up the dividend companies’ performance in its September report. The report mentioned that dividends represented 40% of the stock market returns since 1930 and 54% during decades of high inflation. It also mentioned that companies that raise their dividends during inflationary periods outperform the broader market because of positive investor sentiment.Story continuesFurther elaborating on the dividend investment, we will discuss the highest-paying monthly dividend stocks in this article.25 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that offer monthly payouts to shareholders.

105,43a673cd-b059-3eac-b3a2-35b38ed0df63,TGT,2022-11-25,Is Trending Stock Target Corporation (TGT) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-target-corporation-tgt-140002148.html,1669298402,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this retailer have returned -2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has gained 13.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -51.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -53.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -57.9%. This estimate has changed -29.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 indicates a change of +73.9% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -18.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $31.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $108.56 billion and $112 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 11.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Navient due for a pullback?

Also, the bottom line declined 18.5% on a year-over-year basis.The results of Navient were affected by the fall in non-interest income and net interest income (NII).

Nonetheless, lower expenses aided the company.Navient’s GAAP net income was $105 million, down from $173 million in the prior-year quarter.NII &amp; Expenses Decrease, Provisions RiseNII (on a non-GAAP basis) was $247 million, down 17.4% year over year.

The charge-off rate is expected to be 1.5-2%.Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin for the Business Processing segment is projected in the high teens.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.81% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Navient has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Navient has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNavient belongs to the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency exchange platform industry, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Cryptocurrency Exchanges in the World.Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, or trade digital assets in exchange for other assets, such as fiat currencies or other digital currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized, where there is an entity that manages the platform and holds the user's assets, or decentralized, where the platform is run by the users themselves. Cryptocurrency exchanges typically charge a fee for each transaction and facilitate the buying, selling, or trading of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.Crypto's ""Lehman Moment""Sam Bankman-Fried is an MIT graduate, former billionaire, and former CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas that is now filing for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and quickly grew it to one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world through strategic M&amp;A and collaborations. The business was booming for FTX and the company had gained the attention of leading financial institutions including Blackrock, Tiger Global Management, and Sequoia Capital. FTX also engaged in aggressive marketing strategies and had celebrities including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, and Stephen Curry invest in and promote its platform.On November 2, CoinDesk published an article that triggered a chain reaction, bringing FTX and Alameda Research to file for chapter 11. Alameda Research, also founded and led by Sam Bankman-Fried, is a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. According to the company's balance sheet, Alameda Research had $14.6 billion worth of assets, a majority of which was FTT tokens. FTT tokens are minted by FTX, and compared to other cryptocurrencies, have little transparency which makes them difficult to track and regulate. When Alameda's balance sheet was disclosed, on November 6, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, announced that Binance will sell all its FTT tokens. This caused the price of FTT to tank significantly and resulted in the insolvency of Alameda Research. On November 8, Binance announced that it would acquire FTX to pull it out of bankruptcy. However, on November 9, Binance backed out of the deal citing the mishandling of consumers' funds by FTX to be the reason. On November 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX used billions of dollars of clients' funds to place risky bets via Alameda Research. Both FTX and Alameda Research have now filed for bankruptcy and the exchange's implosion has wiped out $152 billion from the world's 15 largest cryptocurrencies' market value. The Financial Times has called this event ""crypto's Lehman moment"".Story continuesThe Cryptocurrency Exchange Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency exchange industry was worth $30.18 billion in 2021. The industry is expected to reach a value of $37.07 billion by the end of 2022 and then grow to $264.32 billion by the end of 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate of 27.8% from 2022 to 2030.  This growth is primarily attributed to the rising acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are expected to fuel the demand for cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Moreover, investments in the research and development of blockchain technology are expected to further advance the growth of the global cryptocurrency exchange platform industry.End-use-wise, the commercial segment dominated the global cryptocurrency exchange market and held a 68.20% revenue share in 2021. This is attributed to the fact that a majority of financial institutions and businesses are becoming inclined towards offering crypto trading services on their own platforms and are exploring strategic collaborations with prominent cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Some of the top financial services companies that are prominent backers of blockchain technology and are exploring collaborations with cryptocurrency exchange platforms include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Moreover, the personal-use segment is expected to grow at the fastest compound annual growth rate through the forecasted period, due to an influx of crypto traders from emerging markets.Region-wise, North America held the dominant market share and accounted for over 29% of the global cryptocurrency exchange market's revenue in 2021. However, the APAC region is expected to grow at the fastest rate through the forecasted period due to the rising popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies in emerging markets, for instance, China and India.According to CoinMarketCap, as of November 23, 2022, there are over 21,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation that hold a total market capitalization of more than $824.8 billion and have a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $60.12 billion.

Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Visa due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Visa Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on Growing Payments VolumeVisa reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.93 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86 and our estimate of $1.83. The bottom line climbed 19% year over year.Net revenues improved 19% year over year to $7,787 million during the September quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus mark of $7,544 million and our estimate of $7,547.9 million.The strong quarterly results were aided by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. International traveling witnessed an increase during the quarter due to the stronger dollar. As such, spending on travel and entertainment rose from the year-ago period. However, elevated operating costs partly offset the upside.Full-year fiscal 2022 net revenues were $29.3 billion, up 22% year over year. Further, full-year earnings of $7.50 per share increased 27% from the year-ago period.Operational PerformanceOn a constant-dollar basis, the payments volume of Visa rose 10% year over year in the September quarter. Processed transactions (implying transactions processed by Visa) advanced 12% year over year to 50.9 billion, despite inflation and rising interest rate worries, beating our estimate of 49.5 billion.The total cross-border volume of Visa, on a constant dollar basis, rose 36% year over year in the quarter under review. Excluding transactions within Europe, V’s cross-border volume (that usually boosts the company’s international transaction revenues) grew 49% year over year on a constant-dollar basis.Service revenues of $3,458 million improved 11% year over year during the September quarter, beating our estimate of $3,433.5 million, thanks to higher payments volume in the prior quarter. Data processing revenues grew 10% year over year to $3,765 million, beating our estimate of $3,669.2 million.Other revenuesof $551 million registered year-over-year growth of 13% but missed our estimate of $610.4 million. Meanwhile, International transaction revenues jumped 52% year over year to $2,873 million in the quarter under review, beating our estimate of $2,490.3 million.Client incentives(a contra-revenue item) increased 20% year over year to $2,860 million, beating our estimate of $2,655.6 million. The metric accounted for 26.9% of Visa’s gross revenues of $10,647 million.Operating expenses of $2,632 million escalated 18% year over year, mainly due to higher personnel and professional fees as well as general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased 27.2% year over year to $159 million in the September quarter.Story continuesBalance Sheet (as of Sep 30, 2022)Visa exited the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $15,689 million, which decreased 4.8% from fiscal year-end Sep 30, 2021.Total assets of $85.5 billion increased 3.1% from fiscal year-end Sep 30, 2021.Long-term debt amounted to $20.2 billion, up 1.1% from fiscal year-end Sep 30, 2021.

Free cash flow of $5,581 million climbed from $3,763 million in the year-ago period.Capital Deployment UpdateVisa rewarded $2.9 billion to shareholders to the tune of $2.1 billion in share buybacks and dividends of $794 million in the September quarter. As of Sep 30, 2022, V had leftover authorized funds of $5.1 billion under its share buyback program.The company increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to 45 cents per share. It authorized a new $12 billion share buyback program.OutlookThe company plans to extend expenses by high single digits in the coming year, which might be reduced depending on the economic and geopolitical scenarios.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Visa has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Visa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVisa is part of the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. Over the past month, Equifax (EFX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 20%.

We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking.

In this article you will see the top 10 stock picks of Osterweis Capital Management as of the third quarter of last year.

Osterweis, Osterweis Capital Management serves the portfolio management needs of high net worth individuals, foundations and endowments. The firm provides investment management services through various products, including individually managed portfolios and mutual funds. After earning his B.A in Philosophy from Bowdoin College and his M.B.A from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Osterweis began his career as a senior analyst focused on forest products and the paper industry for several regional brokerage firms. He later joined E.F. Hutton &amp; Company. In late 1982, John Osterweis decided to pursue portfolio management as a fulltime occupation, thus establishing Osterweis Capital Management in April of 1983. A member of the Management Committee, he also serves as a principal and co-lead portfolio manager for the firm's core equity and flexible balanced strategies.Story continuesOsterweis Capital Management, as an investment management firm, focuses on investments with acceptable downside risk and underappreciated growth potential.

Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $35.3 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: -13%The second largest railroad company in the United States, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), alongside its subsidiaries, operates over 8300 locomotives across 23 states. Founded in 1862, the company is based in Omaha, Nebraska.On October 22, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin raised the price target on Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) to $252 from $227 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares of the company.According to the 13F filings for the third quarter of 2021, Osterweis Capital Management holds 180,108 shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). These shares are valued at more than $35.3 million, representing 1.92% of the investment firm’s portfolio value.Chris Hohn of TCI Fund Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) as of the end of the third quarter, according to the data tracked by Insider Monkey. Overall, 63 funds were bullish on the company by the end of Q3, compared to 69 in the previous quarter.Vltava Fund, an investment management firm, published its first-quarter 2021 investor letter in which it mentioned Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). Here is what the fund had to say:“There was a slight change in Vltava Fund’s portfolio in the first quarter. We sold shares of Union Pacific. It was one of three stocks we bought a year ago at the market bottom. Although from a P/E viewpoint this was one of our most expensive purchases ever, the shares worked out quite well, and, when they were more than 90% higher at the beginning of this year, we decided to take profit and put the money into stocks with more attractive valuations.”9. PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $35.3 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: Blackstone Inc. Acquired PS Business Parks for $7.5 Billion in April 2022PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) is a California-based publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, develops, owns and operates commercial properties.John Osterweis' hedge fund reported holding 225,249 shares of PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) at the end of the third quarter, amounting to more than $35.3 million in worth and representing 1.92% of the fund's investment portfolio.Of the 867 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 12 were long PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) at the end of the third quarter, down from 16 in the preceding quarter. Israel Englander of Millennium Management is among the leading stakeholders of the company.On September 30, Wells Fargo analyst Blaine Heck upgraded PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $163, up from $155. The analyst argues that the company has successfully overcome many concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on small tenants and recent large move-outs, and valuation now appears fair, relative to peers.Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund, in its Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB), and shared their insights on the company. Here is what the fund said:“Filling a niche. The Real Estate sector continued to add to the strong run it has enjoyed since the COVID-19 lows of early 2020. At that time, we took a stake in PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB) based on our view that the market was being overly pessimistic about the long-term prospects for the real estate investment trust (REIT). Our actions were validated as the business has been a solid performer in the portfolio.PS Business Parks operates in the industrial, warehouse, and “flex” (combination of industrial &amp; office) real estate segment. Unlike competitors who often lease tens of thousands of square feet to single tenants, many of PS Business’ clients rent less than 5,000 square feet at a given location. The business also offers shorter leases— usually one to three years—than many of its peers.The company’s differentiated approach results in fewer competitors and less pricing pressure when seeking to attract tenants. Many investors initially saw the duration of PSB’s leases as a headwind for the business as the economy shut down and prospects for the commercial real estate market were dismal. However, rent collections and commercial activity have proven more resilient than feared, and PSB’s fundamentals appear to be heading in the right direction.Longer term, we continue to be impressed with PSB’s management team, which has demonstrated a knack for efficient use of capital all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Management’s focus on highly efficient capital deployment is evidenced by the company’s trailing 10-year free cash flow to invested capital yield of ~9% vs. an industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) peer median of 2%. The yield is impressive in our view, given the company has grown its inventory of square footage by a 10% compounded annualized growth rate over the past two decades.”8. Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $37.18 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: +3.4%Waste Connections, Inc.

(NYSE:WCN) to $147 from $139, and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.

(NASDAQ:ODFL), with 897,068 shares worth approximately $256.5 million.Wedgewood Partners, in their Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL). Here is what the fund said:“We first bought shares of Old Dominion Freight Line in the third quarter 2018. Worried over the impact of the unfolding industrial downtown on the trucking industry, we sold the stock shortly thereafter during the second quarter of 2019. That was a mistake. We were correct to be worried about the trucking industry in 2019, but we were very wrong on how resilient Old Dominion’s business model would power through the industry downturn in 2019, as well as the Company’s exceptional performance during pandemic-laden 2020. Bucking the industry, the Company actually grew earnings per share by +3.8% and +11.4% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Licking our wounds, we are shareholders once again in this terrific Company.Old Dominion Freight Line has been a family run business for decades. Old Dominion was founded in 1934 in Richmond, Virginia by Earl and Lillian Congdon, running a single truck between Richmond and Norfolk. The founding year was fortuitous as the U.S. economy was in the early innings of its slow recovery from the Great Depression. The trucking industry boomed during the first half of the 1940s because of new congressional industry regulations and World War II armament spending…” (Click here to see the full text).6. Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V), with over 18.33 million shares in the company, valued at over $4 billion.Here is what L1 Capital has to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“In our view, the payment network company, Visa, remains very well positioned to participate in an ever-expanding market for electronic payments. In time, ‘Buy now, Pay Later’ may have a modest impact on Visa’s transaction volumes, however in aggregate, we believe it will have the greater effect of supporting growth in electronic payments more broadly. Nearer term, we believe the recovery in international travel as the world gradually normalises and learns to live with COVID-19 will be materially positive for Visa’s financial performance. eCommerce will also remain a positive key driver for Visa growth.” Click to continue reading and see Was Osterweis Capital Management Right About These 5 Stocks?. Suggested articles:11 Best Coal Stocks To Buy Now16 Best Gambling Stocks To Buy12 Best AI Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None.

For any number of reasons, such value stocks may have fallen out of favor with investors and analysts. As such, the share price trades below what it should be worth based on the company’s fundamentals such as its earnings and book value. Most value stocks are older, more established companies where shares are trading at depressed or bargain prices. Value investors are people who take a long-term approach and buy a stock that is currently undervalued with the expectation that it will appreciate over time as the market eventually takes into account the company’s overall financial health as well as its future earnings potential.In fact, many of the most successful investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, identify themselves as value investors. They’re always on the hunt for stocks of good companies that are undervalued but should eventually recover and trade higher. Here are seven value stocks you can count on in this uncertain market.VVisa$212.34UPSUnited Parcel Service$183.65TXNTexas Instruments$179.14CETCentral Securities$34.96URIUnited Rentals$360.81UNPUnion Pacific$211.95AMTAmerican Tower$218.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks: Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit card giant Visa’s (NYSE:V) stock is down 6% this year and 12% below its 52-week high of $235. The median price target on the stock is currently $248 a share, which is 20% higher than its current level. This presents a rare opportunity for value investors with a long time horizon to buy shares in a great American company at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. Over the past five years, V stock had gained 85%.V stock had been as low as $178 a share in mid-Oct. before the company issued better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. The San Francisco-based company reported that it earned $1.93 a share on revenues of $7.79 billion in the July through September period. Wall Street had forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on revenues of $7.55 billion. Visa also announced in Oct. that it’s raising its quarterly dividend by 20%, providing even more value to shareholders.Story continuesValue Stocks: United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockWith the exception of, perhaps, the holidays, shipping parcels around the world isn’t a very exciting business. But as the world’s largest shipping and logistics company with annual revenues in 2021 of $85 billion, Atlanta, Georgia-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is the kind of value stock that investors can buy on the cheap with expectations that it will deliver long-term gains. UPS stock is down 16% on the year and trading at $180 a share. But over the last five years, the share price has grown 60%, and it is up 157% over the past decade.The median price target on UPS stock is currently $196, or nearly 10% higher than where the shares currently trade. For all of this year, UPS is forecasting revenue of about $102 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%. The company also intends to payout $5.20 billion in dividends to shareholders, giving it a strong yield of 3.37%. The company also plans to buy back at least $3 billion of its own stock. UPS stock currently trades at 14 times future earnings, which is below the average among stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making UPS shares look comparatively cheap.Value Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockDallas-based Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the kind of mature company that Wall Street has fallen out of love with and investors tend to ignore. However, discounting TXN stock would be a mistake. Today, Texas Instruments is a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. Unbeknownst to most people, the company is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world.TXN stock is down 10% this year and currently trading at $172 a share. However, over the last five years the shares have climbed 74% higher. Looking out 10 years, the stock has gained nearly 500%. If the share price appreciation isn’t enticing enough, consider also that Texas Instruments pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.76%. In addition, the stock looks quite undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more.Central Securities (CET)closed-end funds (CEFs)Source: ShutterstockCentral Securities (NYSEAMERICAN:CET) is a closed-end fund that offers great value to investors. In operation since 1929, Central Securities has been led since the 1970s by Wilmot Kidd III. While Kidd is also not a household name, he is regarded by many in professional investing circles as one of the greatest investors of all-time and the equal of Warren Buffett in terms of his returns.When Kidd took over Central Securities in 1974, the fund had $34 million in assets under management. Today that figure is $1.3 billion. While unknown to most, Central Securities has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A /BRK.B) over the past two decades. Central Securities has returned an annualized 14.5% with dividends reinvested to shareholders over the past 48 years, beating an 11.7% return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the same timeframe.Central Securities holds concentrated positions in a select number of stocks, some of which it has owned for 40 years. The company first bought Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock in 1986, and spent $700,000 to establish a position in private insurer Plymouth Rock back in 1982. The Plymouth Rock investment is worth more than $295 million today. Central Securities also has an extremely low expense ratio of less than 1% and has a history of paying outsized dividends. Down 23% this year, CET stock is a steal at its current price of $34 a share.United Rentals (URI)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockStamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world.  The company also boasts the biggest fleet of construction vehicles for rent on the planet. While URI stock has performed well, it gets scant attention from the media or public and continues to trade at levels that suggest it is undervalued. Year-to-date, United Rentals stock is up 6% and trading at $349 a share. That’s a significant outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500 that is down 18% in 2022. Over five years, the stock is up 128%.However, a price-earnings ratio of 12 is low and indicates that URI stock is trading at a discount right now. The median price target on the stock is $387.50, implying 11% upside from here. This is the type of stock that, while not cool, is necessary and manages to perform well in any market conditions.Union Pacific Corp.

Along with Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific forms a duopoly over long-haul freight rail service in the Western U.S., controlling much of the rail traffic west of the Mississippi River.This year, UNP stock is down 14% at $212 per share, and 24% below its 52-week high of $278.94. But over the last five years, the stock has climbed 80% higher, and it has gained nearly 250% since November 2012. Despite the success, Union Pacific’s stock trades at a modest 18 times forward earnings. Shareholders benefit from a dividend yield of 2.45%. Analysts seem to agree that there is more value to be extracted from Union Pacific.

While most investors might yawn at the mere mention of a REIT, American Tower stands out as owner of the largest portfolio of wireless internet towers in the U.S. With its towers being adapted to handle fifth generation (5G) wireless, the company is rapidly expanding its infrastructure and network as demand soars for the most powerful internet possible.AMT stock is down 23% since January and changing hands at just under $220 a share. However, the shares have gained 50% over five years and grown 195% over the last decade. The P/E ratio is a little high at 34, but analysts seem to feel that the share price has room to run. The median price target on the stock is $240 a share, which would be about 10% above where it is currently trading. AMT stock also pays a solid quarterly dividend that yields 2.67%. The company’s earnings are forecast to rise steadily as demand for 5G internet continues to swell.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in V and CET.

112,52994c76-bfe3-3034-bc38-123e159d9b47,VZ,2022-11-25,4 No-Brainer Dividend Stocks for the End of 2022,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-no-brainer-dividend-stocks-204306731.html,1669063386,STORY,"['MSFT', 'VZ', 'PG', 'MDT']","[The end of the year is usually an excellent time to look for deals. In 2022, a bear market caused by rising interest rates in response to the highest inflation in four decades punished stock prices. A recent reversal in the downward trend has caused a slight recovery. But some stocks that were oversold during the year are still down considerably and potentially undervalued. So it’s an excellent time to review your dividend stocks portfolio tracker and research potential dividend stocks for the end of 2022.Below we discuss four quality dividend stocks with solid yields and growth with acceptable valuations. We focus on dividend stocks with reliable safety and the potential for long-term returns.VZVerizon$38.66PGProcter &amp; Gamble$144.49MSFTMicrosoft$242.68MDTMedtronic$82.35InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon (VZ)a Verizon (VZ) sign in front of headquarters building with grass in frontSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a stock we have discussed before. But the combination of undervaluation and high dividend yield make it attractive. The stock price has bounced back a bit in the past few weeks but is still down about 26%. Verizon is significantly undervalued based on historical metrics.The company provides cellular and broadband services to retail and business customers. Verizon serves roughly 120 million wireless connections, 6.7 million FiOS and other broadband connections, and approximately 25 million fixed-line telecom connections. Total revenue was $136 million in the last 12 months, making the firm the second-largest telecommunication company in the United States.Verizon is paying a 6.8% dividend yield, just below the recent peak and nearly the highest in a decade. The company reliably increases the dividend by 2% annually. It has done so for 18 years, making the stock a Dividend Contender. Moreover, the dividend safety is conservative, with a payout ratio of approximately 47%, alleviating the fear of a dividend cut.Story continuesThe combination of a bear market and weak retail cellular growth has pressured the stock price while simultaneously increasing the dividend yield and lowering the valuation. Verizon is trading at an earnings multiple of about 7.4x, almost the lowest in the past 10 years. The stock is a good one for investors seeking dividend growth and income.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (PG) is one of the most famous Dividend Kings and Dividend Aristocrats. The stock is rarely undervalued. But it is down about 12% in 2022, possibly making it a good time to acquire shares.The firm sells consumer products globally, operating through five business segments. The five business segments are beauty; grooming; health care; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine and family care. Brands include Tide, Pampers, Charmin, Oral-B, Crest and Old Spice. Most brands are no. 1 or 2 in their market segments. Total revenue was $80.187 million in the fiscal year 2021 and $80.461 million in the past 12 months.Procter &amp; Gamble has one of the longest dividend streaks over 100 years. Also, it has paid a rising dividend for 66 years, one of only a few companies to achieve the 60-year mark. Additionally, the dividend growth has been slow and steady at roughly 4.9% in the past five years and around 5.2% in the past 10 years. The forward dividend yield is about 2.6%, supported by a reasonable 60% payout ratio. This is near the higher end of our target, but consistent earnings and cash flow limit risk.Despite the lower stock price in 2022, Procter &amp; Gamble is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.3x. This value is not a great deal, but it is within the five-year and 10-year ranges. The main interest, though, is low volatility combined with a growing dividend.Microsoft (MSFT)the Microsoft (MSFT) logo displayed on smartphone which is laying on top of a keyboard. symbolizes MSFT stock and blue-chip stocksSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock price was caught in the technology sector downdraft. As a result, the stock is down approximately 28% year to date (YTD). But unlike some other tech stocks, Microsoft is wildly profitable and still growing revenue. Moreover, it was not bloated with too many employees, a sign of experienced and prudent management.Microsoft is a global leader in personal and enterprise software. Also, it sells gaming hardware and tablets. Its major brands include Windows, Outlook, Skype, LinkedIn, SharePoint, Surface, Bing and Xbox. Total revenue was $198.27 million in the fiscal year 2021 and $203.075 million in the past 12 months.Surprisingly, Microsoft is a dividend growth stock. The company started paying one in 2012 and has raised it each year. The growth rate has been about 13% in the past decade. The modest payout ratio of roughly 29% suggests many more future increases. Microsoft is not a high-yield stock. It currently yields 1%, below the five-year average. However, the main interest is the rock-solid dividend safety supported by an AAA-rated balance sheet and double-digit dividend growth.The stock is undervalued based on historical ranges. The forward P/E ratio is 25.9x, which seems high. But it is within the five-year and 10-year ranges.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is not as well-known as the three other dividend stocks in this article. But the company is one of the world’s largest medical device companies. The stock price has fallen about 21% in 2022 and is nearing the lows set at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The company is struggling with higher inflation, a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and poor results from a recent medical device trial. That said, the company is high quality.The company has four business segments: Cardiac and Vascular group (about 36% of total revenue), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (about 29% of total revenue), Restorative Therapies Group (about 27% of total revenue) and Diabetes Group (about 8% of total revenue). Total revenue was $30.117 million in the fiscal year 2021 and $31.597 million in the last 12 months.Medtronic is known for its 45-year streak of dividend increases, making the company a Dividend Aristocrat and Dividend Champion. In the trailing five years, the raises have averaged about 8.1%, a respectable amount. Moreover, the forward dividend yield is 3.26%, a decade high. But it is supported by a reasonable payout ratio of about 57% indicating future increases should continue.The stock price decreases have made Medtronic a deal. It is trading at the lowest valuation in years. The forward P/E ratio is about 15.1x, below the five-year and 10-year ranges. The market expects little from Medtronic, but the impending spinoff should streamline the company.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held LONG positions in VZ, PG, MSFT and MDT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. The author is not a licensed or registered investment adviser or broker/dealer.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to NVIDIA's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:28% = US$6.0b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.28 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 28% ROEFirst thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, NVIDIA's considerable five year net income growth of 23% was to be expected.Next, on comparing NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 27% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about NVIDIA's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is NVIDIA Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?NVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1%, meaning that it has the remaining 93% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.4% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NVIDIA's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 63%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with NVIDIA's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

CAH is well-poised for growth on the back of a diversified product portfolio, acquisition-driven strategy and a robust pharmaceutical segment. However, margin contraction remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 52.3% on a year-to-date basis against the industry's decline of 14.9%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 17.3% in the same time frame.The company — with a market capitalization of $20.68 billion — is a nationwide drug distributor and a provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. It anticipates earnings to improve 11.2% over the next five years. Cardinal Health's earnings yield is 6.7% compared with the industry's 5.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving the Performance?Cardinal Health's Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings provide it with a competitive edge in its niche area of operations. It offers industry expertise through an expanding portfolio of safe products.The company pursues an acquisition-driven strategy and remains committed to investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and bolster profits.Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment is the second-largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. The segment's products and services comprise pharmaceutical distribution, manufacturer and specialty solutions, and nuclear and pharmacy offerings. The segment's strength is expected to drive its performance in the days ahead.In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, pharmaceutical revenues amounted to $45.8 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The performance reflects branded pharmaceutical sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.On the fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings call, the company stated that it has been witnessing continued commercial momentum with Navista TS.Notable DevelopmentsIn July, Cardinal Health acquired a smart platform for transferring prescriptions directly to patients through a secure mobile app — ScalaMed. The acquisition is likely to boost Cardinal Health’s digital connectivity, consequently leading to higher patient satisfaction and greater medication adherence. It has the potential to bring more patients to the system, thereby boosting Cardinal Health’s top line going forward. The company acquired the Bendcare group purchasing organization (CPO-GPO) entity in the same month to strengthen its specialty solutions business. The buyout is likely to expand Cardinal Health's distribution opportunities and technology solution offerings for specialty practices.Story continuesIn June, Cardinal Health partnered with Zipline and began long-range drone deliveries in North Carolina. The latest partnership between the two companies is aimed at transforming patients’ experience while improving care delivery. It is aimed at mitigating the inventory stock-out risks and lessening the barriers for patients accessing necessary products, especially in difficult-to-reach areas. During the same month, CAH expanded its warehouse footing by adding a new distribution center in the Columbus, OH, area to support its at-Home Solutions business. This move is likely to have provided a boost to Cardinal Health’s pharmaceutical distribution capability, which is included as one of the services in the Pharmaceutical business.What's Weighing on the Stock?In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit decreased 1.7% year over year to $1.61 billion. The gross margin contracted 40 basis points year over year, which reflects rising costs. The inflationary pressure is likely to continue in the next few quarters. The company reported a significant decline in operating income to $137 million during the last reported quarter compared with $415 million in the year-ago quarter.With respect to the Medical segment, revenues fell 9% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. The company reported a loss of $8 million for the Medical segment. The company recorded a loss during the quarter, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain restrictions in products and distribution.

118,c23102b2-244a-37d2-9c14-f2a2a20d9d75,APD,2022-11-25,Top 10 Green Hydrogen Companies In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-green-hydrogen-companies-131200638.html,1669381920,STORY,"['BE', 'PLUG', 'FCELB', 'ADANIGREEN.NS', 'APD', 'LIN']","[In this article, we shall discuss the top green hydrogen companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the green hydrogen and clean energy sector in 2022, go directly and see Top 5 Green Hydrogen Companies In The World.According to a report by McKinsey and Company, the combustion of fossil fuels currently produces 83 percent of the global carbon emissions. As the political and social rhetoric around the climate crisis intensifies, governments around the world are looking to transition to more clean sources of energy. According to the report, green hydrogen is predicted to spearhead the decarbonization effort, playing a critical role in facilitating a complete transition to net-zero by 2050. According to McKinsey, by 2050, oil production is expected to decrease by more than 55% than it is today, and natural gas production is likely to be 70% lower. Coal production is likely to face complete elimination.According to a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), green hydrogen has immense potential, swiftly emerging as one of the most ideal alternatives to fossil fuels, and are great for renewable energy storage and transport. Green hydrogen has been subsidized in a number of emissions reduction pledges at the UN Climate Conference COP26, in an ongoing effort to decarbonize heavy industry, long haul freight, shipping and aviation. The Inflation Reduction Act, the Green Hydrogen Catapult, and a series of legislative efforts by the European Commission are set to decarbonize the global gas market by facilitating the uptake of renewable and low carbon energy sources, including green hydrogen, to ensure clean energy security for the world.Here is what Dr. Emanuele Taibi, Head of the Power Sector Transformation Strategies, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), told the WEF with regards to the decarbonization potential of green hydrogen.""Green hydrogen is an important piece of the energy transition. It is not the next immediate step, as we first need to further accelerate the deployment of renewable electricity to decarbonize existing power systems, accelerate electrification of the energy sector to leverage low-cost renewable electricity, before finally decarbonize sectors that are difficult to electrify – like heavy industry, shipping and aviation – through green hydrogen. It is important to note that today we produce significant amount of grey hydrogen, with high CO2 (and methane) emissions: priority would be to start decarbonizing existing hydrogen demand, for example by replacing ammonia from natural gas with green ammonia.""Story continuesA recent market report by PWC suggests that the global green hydrogen market is expected to grow from an estimated $160 billion in 2022 to $263.5 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 10.5% between 2022 and 2027. There is a rising demand for hydrogen in fuel cell electric vehicles (FECV) and rockets in the aerospace industry, which in turn, are acting as fundamental growth drivers. A total of 99% of hydrogen is derived from fossil fuel reformation, as it is conventionally cost-effective. Demand is projected to grow at a moderate, steady pace through niche applications until 2030, after which it is likely to pick up and accelerate through to 2050. By 2050, green hydrogen demand could reach up to 500 million metric tonnes per year, depending on global climate ambitions and sector-specific activities. Production costs are set to increase by more than 50% through 2035, and then enter a decline rate of growth until 2050.Many large economies of the world, like the United States, Canada, Russia, China, India and Germany, have already undertaken a transition into clean energy sources like green hydrogen, and have developed regions for both competitive and  non-competitive hydrogen production, which could further lead to in-country trade. Some of the leading green hydrogen companies in the world include Shell plc (LON:SHEL), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN), and Reliance Industries (NASDAQ:RELI). In this article, we shall go over the top green hydrogen companies in the world.Photo by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we carefully screened the global green hydrogen market to pick some of the largest, or most prominent players in the sector.

You can skip this part and see the top 5 entries in this article by clicking 5 Biggest Movie Companies in the World.The entertainment and film production industry is one of the largest and oldest in the world. It has also continuously evolved over the years, as new technologies have emerged to provide entertainment. In its oldest form in the modern age, the movie sector was limited to live, theatrical performances as viewers watched their favorite performers perform live. With the advent of the camera, the sector was transformed as production companies took over the charge and started recording motion pictures. These were distributed across picture houses, now known as cinemas, with viewers now watching recorded performances and letting the producers recover their investments by paying a ticket fee.According to research by Research and Markets, the global film and video market stood at an eye-popping $234 billion in 2020. In the future, the research firm expects this industry to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% to stand at $252 billion by the end of this year. For 2025, the CAGR for this industry drops to 6%, with an estimated size of $318 billion by the end of the year. Additionally, the firm also expects drones to play an important role in the film sector in the future due to their ease of use for aerial operations and recording.With technology spreading all over the globe, the American film industry is no longer unrivaled in its dominance in the sector. Emerging markets, such as those in China and India, are rapidly growing, and their large populations provide local companies with a large market to target. India's film sector Bollywood is renowned internationally for its size and diversity, and the county's large production houses with plenty of revenue.Research from the research division of PricewaterhouseCoopers says that the Indian box office will make a strong recovery and grow at a CAGR of 39.3% to stand at 138 billion Indian rupees or $1.9 billion by the end of 2025. The segment undertook heavy losses in 2020 as the ongoing pandemic forced governments to impose lockdowns. These resulted in cinemas closing down and the producers which had made significant investments into movies taking serious losses since these movies could not be aired.Story continuesSome of the notable names on this list include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).15 Biggest Movie Companies in the WorldPhoto by Kosta Bratsos on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 biggest movie companies in the world, we will use all-time annual box office gross revenue for the companies as of September 2021.

For example, in July Marvel’s latest Thor movie underperformed at the international box office due to not receiving release dates in China.While Disney did not reveal the budget of the Avatar sequel, James Cameron, the director of the movie, cited that it has to be the third or fourth highest-grossing movie to break even. Being allowed to open up in China might allow the franchise movie to live up to past performance expectations.The first Avatar movie released in 2009 grossed nearly $2.9 billion worldwide, with $259 million coming from China, making it the highest-grossing movie of all time. It edged out “Avengers: Endgame” after a September 2022 rerelease as the movie added $73 million in ticket sales.The launch of the first Avatar movie sparked a boom in multiplex construction in China which allowed U.S.-based multiplex businesses like IMAX IMAX to solidify their businesses in China.Chinese theaters saw lines of up to six hours long for the Avatar movie. Before the movie, IMAX had 14 screens in China and currently has 800, with 200 more contracted to be built.The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteFurther, this will allow Disney, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to diversify its income source into high-growth markets and economies, which will fund its key growth drivers like Disney+.Story continuesDisney+ is facing significant competition in the streaming market from Netflix NFLX and Apple’s AAPL Apple TV+ and is spending huge capital to bring out original content to fight against stiff competition in an extremely saturated market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Disney Movie Release in China to Fund Disney+ BusinessDisney is focusing on its streaming service, which will cost the company capital in terms of content and marketing to fend off competition from Netflix and Apple.Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space and is enjoying the first mover’s advantage in the industry. Its solid content portfolio is a major growth driver.Since the launch of Apple TV+, several Apple original series and films have earned more than 240 awards and 950 nominations, including the acclaimed SAG Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Critics Choice Awards. These accolades are catching viewers’ attention and helping it to win market share from Netflix and Disney.In order to fight peers, we expect Disney will expand its Direct-to-Consumer spending by 12.5% year over year. As a result, Direct-to-Consumer operating loss is expected to be $4.88 billion for fiscal 2023 compared with $4 billion in fiscal 2022. The rising spending and losses are expected to keep consolidated margins under pressure.Also, Disney has an extremely leveraged balance sheet portraying that it is lending more money to grow business in a highly fragmented market. Total borrowings were $48.37 billion as of Oct 1, 2022, compared with $46.6 billion as of Jul 2, 2022. Disney’s debt balance compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $11.62 billion.All of this impacted the share price of Disney quite adversely. In the year-to-date period, its shares fell 36.2% compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s decline of 33.7%.Amid this, the release of the new Avatar movie in China is welcome news for the company. This will create a new revenue source for the company and help increase its top line in the coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

124,1ff94899-36eb-3b16-9f0e-79f9a738012d,DIS,2022-11-25,Is The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-companys-nyse-dis-140119684.html,1669298479,STORY,['DIS'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 16% over the past three months. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Walt Disney's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walt Disney is:3.3% = US$3.6b ÷ US$108b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Walt Disney's Earnings Growth And 3.3% ROEAs you can see, Walt Disney's ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 13%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 40% seen by Walt Disney over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Walt Disney's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 20% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is DIS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DIS is currently mispriced by the market.Is Walt Disney Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Walt Disney. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

126,551da2b1-1d8b-395c-bcf0-0d348080f560,DIS,2022-11-25,Bob Iger was on a $10 million consultancy deal at Disney—to advise the CEO he eventually replaced,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bob-iger-10-million-consultancy-133423734.html,1669296863,STORY,['DIS'],"[Before Bob Iger returned to the helm of Disney, the entertainment giant signed him to a $10 million deal to advise his successor Bob Chapek—even though the two executives were hardly speaking.Iger, who rejoined the company as CEO last week after Chapek's ousting, was on a $2 million a year contract until 2026 to advise “on such matters as his successor as chief executive officer may request from time to time,” according to terms disclosed in Disney corporate filings reported by the Financial Times. The agreement came into force when Iger left his role as executive chairman at the end of 2021.The much-loved Iger had hand-picked Chapek to take over the House of Mouse after he had led the company for 15 years. But once Chapek took over as CEO of Disney in February 2020, his relationship with Iger soured rapidly, and the ballooning losses of Disney's streaming Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) division, which includedDisney+, Hulu and ESPN+, eventually led to calls for Chapek's head.According to Disney's SEC filing, the five-year consulting deal enabled the company and Chapek “to have access to Mr. Iger’s unique skills, knowledge and experience with regard to the media and entertainment business” and included monthly and yearly “maximum time commitments” of unspecified length. Disney was also paying Iger’s security costs as an ex-employee which totaled around $750,000 a year, the FT reported.Iger’s return rocked Hollywood and sent shares in Disney surging more than 6% after the announcement was made. Disney did not respond to Fortune's request for comment.How the relationship between the Bobs fell apartIger and Chapek’s relationship began to deteriorate soon after Chapek took the top position at Disney. According to a CNBC report, the relationship between the outgoing and incoming Disney leaders soured after Iger announced he wasn’t going to fully depart from the company in March 2020, in order to help it weather the pandemic.Story continuesChapek was said to be “furious” with Iger sticking around. Having expressed little desire for help, Chapek felt that Iger was postponing his retirement once again and reducing him to second-in-command.Tensions within Disney were further exacerbated in Marck 2022 when Chapek stayed quiet over Florida's “Don’t Say Gay” bill — the legislation that would prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in primary schools in the state where Chapek had just ordered 2,000 of its Disney employees to move to take advantage of lucrative tax credits.Chapek later apologized for his muted response on the bill, but it marked a strong deviation away from Iger’s style, where most of Disney’s stances on political and social issues would come directly from him.Chapek then decided to strategically reorganize the company’s media and entertainment businesses by stripping budget power from content creators and instead centralizing it under his right-hand man, former Goldman Sachs banker Kareem Daniel. This move took away the profit-and-loss power from many of Disney’s veteran division leaders and consolidated that control under Daniel, a shift that was met with strong backlash from longtime Disney employees.Another nail in Chapek's coffin came when he abruptly fired Peter Rice — the head of the company’s TV division — for being an ill fit with Disney's corporate culture. While Disney’s board threw its support behind Chapek and his ousting of Rice, staffers inside Disney said the move tanked morale and further divided the CEO from Disney veterans and Iger.As the tensions surrounding Chapek increased, the relationship between the Bobs got worse, the FT reported, with Iger reportedly complaining to friends that his advice was not sought by his successor at key moments.“Iger never forgave Chapek for the way Chapek distanced himself and took control of the company,” a Disney executive told the FT. “In some ways, Iger thought he would still be the coach. Chapek was not willing.”Iger’s return after a little time offFaith in Chapek’s leadership collapsed when the CEO announced earlier this month that “tough and uncomfortable decisions”, including staff cuts, were coming to the company after its Direct-To-Consumer division reported that losses more than doubled to $4 billion for the fiscal year ending Oct. 1.Iger then received a call on Nov. 18 from board chair Susan Arnold and two days later agreed to return to Disney for another two years to steer the ship back on course.Iger is returning to Disney on a slimmed-down pay package, which includes a $1 million base salary, a $1 million target bonus, and stock awards valued at $25 million. This compares to an average pay package of around $47 million during his last five years as chief executive, the FT reported.“Essentially he’s taken a pay cut of 40%. . . to come back,” Tom Gosling, an executive fellow at the London Business School who established PwC’s executive pay practice, told the FT. “He must love the job, love the company, or see a lot of upside in the share price. Maybe all three.”The first moves taken by Iger after being reinstated as CEO this week were to walk back Chapek’s strategy, return profit and loss power to content creators, and fire Kareem Daniel.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeSick with a new Omicron variant?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$1.8b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 5.9% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Exelon. View our latest analysis for Exelon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Exelon?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Exelon. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Exelon's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Exelon is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Wellington Management Group LLP with 9.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 7.9% of the stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 13 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of ExelonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Exelon Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$56m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Exelon. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Exelon  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.Ultimately the future is most important.

(OKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-attracting-investor-140002408.html,1669298402,STORY,['OKE'],"[Oneok Inc. (OKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this natural gas company have returned +12.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, to which Oneok belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Oneok is expected to post earnings of $1 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.30 indicates a change of +14.7% from what Oneok is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oneok is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Oneok, the consensus sales estimate of $6.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.2%. The $23.99 billion and $23.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +45% and -3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOneok reported revenues of $5.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30.4%. EPS of $0.96 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.28%. The EPS surprise was +3.23%.Over the last four quarters, Oneok surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oneok is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oneok. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, System revenues slumped 5% to $178 million, making up the remaining 50.9% of the total Product revenues. This downside was due to the ongoing global chip shortage.Global Service revenues (50% of total revenues) grew 2% to $350.1 million.F5 Networks registered sales growth across the Americas, witnessing a year-over-year increase of 6.3%. The company registered a 3% and 1.7% decrease in sales growth from the EMEA and APAC regions, respectively.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 10 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks. As high-interest rates and inflation have pulled down the market this year, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors. The fears of possible recession have distressed investors regarding the falling value of their portfolios. Quarterly or monthly dividends are rewarding for investors as they can help them glide through these difficult times. Dividend Kings like 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) have outperformed the broader market this year so far, as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth track records. Moreover, their strong fundamentals and improving balance sheets help them smoothly manage and deliver shareholder returns.According to a recent report published by JPMorgan Asset Management, dividend stocks prop up the market during inflationary periods as strong companies avoid slashing their dividends even after reporting earnings decline. As dividends are still recovering from the ill effects of the pandemic of 2020, dividend payout ratios are currently at low levels, which is faring well for dividend companies and eventually for investors. The report sheds light on the performance of dividend stocks during previous inflations. It referred to the data by Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and JPMorgan Asset Management, mentioning that dividends represented 3.3%, 4.2%, and 4.4% of the total market returns during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, respectively. The report also concluded that dividends remain more stable than earnings when markets fall into a recession.Fidelity Investments also weighed up the dividend companies’ performance in its September report. The report mentioned that dividends represented 40% of the stock market returns since 1930 and 54% during decades of high inflation. It also mentioned that companies that raise their dividends during inflationary periods outperform the broader market because of positive investor sentiment.Story continuesFurther elaborating on the dividend investment, we will discuss the highest-paying monthly dividend stocks in this article.25 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that offer monthly payouts to shareholders.

Shares have added about 5.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Juniper due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Juniper Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates on Record RevenuesJuniper reported solid third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the bottom line and the top line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

You can skip this part and see the top 5 entries in this article by clicking 5 Biggest Movie Companies in the World.The entertainment and film production industry is one of the largest and oldest in the world. It has also continuously evolved over the years, as new technologies have emerged to provide entertainment. In its oldest form in the modern age, the movie sector was limited to live, theatrical performances as viewers watched their favorite performers perform live. With the advent of the camera, the sector was transformed as production companies took over the charge and started recording motion pictures. These were distributed across picture houses, now known as cinemas, with viewers now watching recorded performances and letting the producers recover their investments by paying a ticket fee.According to research by Research and Markets, the global film and video market stood at an eye-popping $234 billion in 2020. In the future, the research firm expects this industry to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% to stand at $252 billion by the end of this year. For 2025, the CAGR for this industry drops to 6%, with an estimated size of $318 billion by the end of the year. Additionally, the firm also expects drones to play an important role in the film sector in the future due to their ease of use for aerial operations and recording.With technology spreading all over the globe, the American film industry is no longer unrivaled in its dominance in the sector. Emerging markets, such as those in China and India, are rapidly growing, and their large populations provide local companies with a large market to target. India's film sector Bollywood is renowned internationally for its size and diversity, and the county's large production houses with plenty of revenue.Research from the research division of PricewaterhouseCoopers says that the Indian box office will make a strong recovery and grow at a CAGR of 39.3% to stand at 138 billion Indian rupees or $1.9 billion by the end of 2025. The segment undertook heavy losses in 2020 as the ongoing pandemic forced governments to impose lockdowns. These resulted in cinemas closing down and the producers which had made significant investments into movies taking serious losses since these movies could not be aired.Story continuesSome of the notable names on this list include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).15 Biggest Movie Companies in the WorldPhoto by Kosta Bratsos on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 biggest movie companies in the world, we will use all-time annual box office gross revenue for the companies as of September 2021.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company reported quarterly numbers on Oct 26, and its shares have gained 21%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 6.7%, since then. In fact, the company’s shares have gained 29.9% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 1.3% decline.United Rentals has been witnessing widespread growth in rental revenues. Even its new upbeat 2022 guidance exhibits broad-based growth across its verticals, with persistent growth opportunities for non-residential and industrial verticals. In terms of project types, large data centers, infrastructure projects, distribution centers and manufacturing holds promise.The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 18.2%, which highlights its inherent strength. We believe that United Rentals offers a sound investment opportunity, as evident from its VGM Score of “A.”The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.50 and $36.57 for 2022 and 2023 has increased 1.7% and 3.7%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Solid Performance: The company’s third-quarter results exhibit solid performance, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3% and grew 40.9% year over year. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business. Although total revenues missed the consensus mark, the top line increased 17.5% year over year, given 20% higher rental revenues. This upside was mainly attributable to a broad-based recovery of activity across end markets served by the company.Fleet productivity was up 8.9% and average original equipment at cost grew 10.6% year over year. The company’s total equipment rentals gross margin rose 130 basis points (bps) year over year to 44.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 bps to 49.9% for the quarter, owing to higher margins from rental revenues and used equipment sales.Higher Infrastructural Spending &amp; Solid 2023 Prospects: United Rentals and other construction companies are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. Notably, United Rentals is expected to maintain positive momentum in the near term as the company’s solutions are closely aligned with President Biden’s policies and industry trends.The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges, and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to help URI. The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid, which will drive growth in 2023. URI sees substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow, and attractive returns for our shareholders.Upbeat View: Backed by solid results in the first nine months of 2022 and the recently completed acquisitions, the company lifted its 2022 guidance during the third-quarter earnings call to reflect stronger growth in the core rental business. The optimism was supported by positive customer sentiments, contractor backlogs and solid visibility.Total revenues are now expected in the range of $11.5-$11.7 billion versus $11.4-$11.7 billion projected earlier. This indicates an increase from $9.72 billion reported in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is now projected between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion compared with the prior projection of $5.4-$5.55 billion. The current projection indicates a jump from the year-ago figure of $4.41 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities is anticipated in the range of $4.05-$4.4 billion (compared with $3.85-$4.25 billion expected earlier), suggesting a rise from $3.69 billion in 2021.Story continues3 Top-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging the LimelightOther top-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the Construction sector, include:EMCOR Group, Inc.

For any number of reasons, such value stocks may have fallen out of favor with investors and analysts. As such, the share price trades below what it should be worth based on the company’s fundamentals such as its earnings and book value. Most value stocks are older, more established companies where shares are trading at depressed or bargain prices. Value investors are people who take a long-term approach and buy a stock that is currently undervalued with the expectation that it will appreciate over time as the market eventually takes into account the company’s overall financial health as well as its future earnings potential.In fact, many of the most successful investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, identify themselves as value investors.

But over the last five years, the share price has grown 60%, and it is up 157% over the past decade.The median price target on UPS stock is currently $196, or nearly 10% higher than where the shares currently trade. For all of this year, UPS is forecasting revenue of about $102 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%. The company also intends to payout $5.20 billion in dividends to shareholders, giving it a strong yield of 3.37%. The company also plans to buy back at least $3 billion of its own stock. UPS stock currently trades at 14 times future earnings, which is below the average among stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making UPS shares look comparatively cheap.Value Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockDallas-based Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the kind of mature company that Wall Street has fallen out of love with and investors tend to ignore. However, discounting TXN stock would be a mistake. Today, Texas Instruments is a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. Unbeknownst to most people, the company is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world.TXN stock is down 10% this year and currently trading at $172 a share. However, over the last five years the shares have climbed 74% higher. Looking out 10 years, the stock has gained nearly 500%. If the share price appreciation isn’t enticing enough, consider also that Texas Instruments pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.76%. In addition, the stock looks quite undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more.Central Securities (CET)closed-end funds (CEFs)Source: ShutterstockCentral Securities (NYSEAMERICAN:CET) is a closed-end fund that offers great value to investors. In operation since 1929, Central Securities has been led since the 1970s by Wilmot Kidd III. While Kidd is also not a household name, he is regarded by many in professional investing circles as one of the greatest investors of all-time and the equal of Warren Buffett in terms of his returns.When Kidd took over Central Securities in 1974, the fund had $34 million in assets under management. Today that figure is $1.3 billion. While unknown to most, Central Securities has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A /BRK.B) over the past two decades. Central Securities has returned an annualized 14.5% with dividends reinvested to shareholders over the past 48 years, beating an 11.7% return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the same timeframe.Central Securities holds concentrated positions in a select number of stocks, some of which it has owned for 40 years. The company first bought Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock in 1986, and spent $700,000 to establish a position in private insurer Plymouth Rock back in 1982. The Plymouth Rock investment is worth more than $295 million today. Central Securities also has an extremely low expense ratio of less than 1% and has a history of paying outsized dividends. Down 23% this year, CET stock is a steal at its current price of $34 a share.United Rentals (URI)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockStamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world.  The company also boasts the biggest fleet of construction vehicles for rent on the planet. While URI stock has performed well, it gets scant attention from the media or public and continues to trade at levels that suggest it is undervalued. Year-to-date, United Rentals stock is up 6% and trading at $349 a share. That’s a significant outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500 that is down 18% in 2022. Over five years, the stock is up 128%.However, a price-earnings ratio of 12 is low and indicates that URI stock is trading at a discount right now. The median price target on the stock is $387.50, implying 11% upside from here. This is the type of stock that, while not cool, is necessary and manages to perform well in any market conditions.Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.Source: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.comUnion Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) is a major part of the U.S. rail infrastructure. Along with Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific forms a duopoly over long-haul freight rail service in the Western U.S., controlling much of the rail traffic west of the Mississippi River.This year, UNP stock is down 14% at $212 per share, and 24% below its 52-week high of $278.94. But over the last five years, the stock has climbed 80% higher, and it has gained nearly 250% since November 2012. Despite the success, Union Pacific’s stock trades at a modest 18 times forward earnings. Shareholders benefit from a dividend yield of 2.45%. Analysts seem to agree that there is more value to be extracted from Union Pacific. The 30 professional analysts who cover the company have a consensus “buy” rating on UNP stock.American Tower (AMT)Antenna Telephone and communication towers have a sunset background. American Tower (AMT) is one of the largest 4G tower operators in the U.S.Source: SERDTHONGCHAI / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). While most investors might yawn at the mere mention of a REIT, American Tower stands out as owner of the largest portfolio of wireless internet towers in the U.S. With its towers being adapted to handle fifth generation (5G) wireless, the company is rapidly expanding its infrastructure and network as demand soars for the most powerful internet possible.AMT stock is down 23% since January and changing hands at just under $220 a share. However, the shares have gained 50% over five years and grown 195% over the last decade. The P/E ratio is a little high at 34, but analysts seem to feel that the share price has room to run. The median price target on the stock is $240 a share, which would be about 10% above where it is currently trading. AMT stock also pays a solid quarterly dividend that yields 2.67%. The company’s earnings are forecast to rise steadily as demand for 5G internet continues to swell.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in V and CET.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Oracle’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle What Is Oracle Worth?Great news for investors – Oracle is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $116.96, but it is currently trading at US$82.56 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Oracle’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Oracle?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Oracle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ORCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ORCL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ORCL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Oracle at this point in time. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Oracle (including 2 which are significant).If you are no longer interested in Oracle, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Amid the flexible working environment, the demand for self-storage space has risen.Therefore, given the favorable self-storage industry fundamentals, Public Storage PSA, a renowned self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) in the United States, is well-poised for growth.The company operates in major metropolitan markets, with nearly half the U.S. population living within a Public Storage trade area. Thus, apart from benefiting from brand recognition, PSA is likely to gain from the economies of scale.  Public Storage’s accretive buyouts to maximize its growth opportunities seem encouraging.  For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired 44 self-storage facilities comprising 3.2 million net rentable square feet of area for $501.9 million.On the balance-sheet front, PSA holds one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with ample liquidity. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. With solid balance-sheet strength, it is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Further, PSA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.58% compared with the 9.70% growth estimated for the industry. Its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 78.38% compared with the industry’s average of 4.65%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.However, Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States with intense competition from several private, regional and local operators.PSA’s development and refurbishment pipeline, although encouraging for long-term growth, exposes the company to operational risks associated with increasing construction costs, entitlement delays and failure to fulfill government requirements.Also, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Analysts seem bearish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share does not indicate a favorable outlook for the company as it has been unchanged over the past two months.Shares of Public Storage have gained 1.5% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s growth of 6.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Equity Commonwealth EQC.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ current-year FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.91.

138,d12c9cbd-54d1-337f-92d4-fb6a095ea2bb,MCD,2022-11-25,7 Sin Stocks That Can Weather a Recessionary Storm,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sin-stocks-weather-recessionary-190637876.html,1669057597,STORY,"['MCD', 'IIPR', 'PEP', 'SAM']","[With global recession fears rising, investors naturally find themselves scrambling for boring, dependable ideas but sin stocks may offer a potentially superior (and more exciting) alternative. To be fair, these ideas may challenge your sensibilities. Please do not mistake these companies as environmental, social and governance (ESG) trades.However, during hard times, few fundamental catalysts feature as much upside potential as cynicism. Whether tying into everyday addictions (such as caffeine or sugar) or aligning with more serious trends, sin stocks may be one of the few sectors that may survive the incoming malaise relatively intact. Yes, the notion stinks in many ways, and I understand this point well. However, when the smelly stuff hits the fan, you gotta do what you gotta do. On that bright note, below are seven sin stocks to buy.PEPPepsiCo$184.40MCDMcDonald’s$274.54PMPhilip Morris$97.11IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$111.45SAMBoston Beer$375.71BUDAnheuser-Busch$55.42RICKRCI Hospitality$86.88InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockOne of the most popular soft drink and snack manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) makes for an everyday solid bet. However, as one of the sin stocks that can weather a recessionary storm, few can match its relevance. Not surprisingly, PEP shares gained nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. While not a great figure by itself, the benchmark equity indices still remain in the red so far this year.Fundamentally, PepsiCo ranks among the sin stocks to buy because its underlying products tie in with everyday addictions. As the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center mentioned, “[i]n regular sodas, the sugar causes dopamine releases in the brain, stimulating pleasure centers. For some, it’s not the ingredients that cause the addiction, but the lifestyle habit that leads you to the fridge.”Stated differently, Pepsi enjoys a captive audience of sorts. And with economic woes brewing on the horizon, consumers might seek cheap pick-me-ups. Therefore, PEP makes for an intriguing case among sin stocks to buy.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockAs one of the most iconic American companies, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the world of western capitalism. With its ubiquity, MCD also makes for a solid purchase for investors seeking a balance between growth and reliability. However, as one of the sin stocks to buy, MCD truly shines.As with PepsiCo above, McDonald’s fundamental case as a vice trade centers on its core product. As Healthline.com mentioned, “[t]he fact is junk food stimulates the reward system in the brain in the same way as addictive drugs, such as cocaine.” Therefore, it’s no surprise that MCD represents one of the few publicly traded securities that are in positive territory for the year.Moving forward, McDonald’s can also benefit from the trade-down effect. Essentially, those that are enjoying nights out at fancy restaurants may start trading down to fast-food joints. Cynically, this dynamic should boost MCD, making it one of the sin stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comGenerally speaking, people regard soft drink and fast-food providers as “acceptable” sin stocks. In other words, an occasional indulgence in a sugary beverage to smooth down a juicy burger doesn’t arouse controversy. However, nobody speaks in those terms regarding tobacco players like Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). If anything, social forces attempt to stifle the industry.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking rates declined significantly over the years. On paper, that’s bad news for sin stocks related to the tobacco industry. However, should economic woes materialize, it’s very possible that smoking rates will increase from current lows.Admittedly, this talking point ties into unsavory concepts. However, the harsh reality is that economic downturns cause stress – sometimes deeply troubling stress. Under these conditions, adults make certain adult choices for relief. Cynically, this may lead to an uptick in demand for PM stock.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)a marijuana leaf displayed among other numbers related to stock performanceSource: ShutterstockOn the other end of the adult liberties segment stands what I’ll diplomatically term the “botanical” industry. In recent years, speculation toward the federal legalization of the underlying green material spiked certain equity units. Unfortunately, the narrative didn’t quite pan out. As well, macroeconomic pressures hurt the sector, including indirect players like Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR).Rather than grow the botanicals themselves, Innovative Industrial provides the services and resources for enterprises that do. On a moral level, then, you can mitigate the aura of sin stocks if you like. More importantly, IIPR appears to make plenty of sense given its relative discount. On a trailing-year basis, IIPR hemorrhaged over 59% of equity value.True, that’s not a great sign. Still, shares gained 20% in the trailing month, reflecting strong near-term momentum. As well, IIPR benefits from fundamental realities. Again, with stress levels likely to rise, folks may need a way to relax. Innovative Industrial helps those who help us – metaphorically speaking of course!Boston Beer (SAM)BeerSource: PixabayOne of the most popular breweries in the U.S., Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) catapulted to fame because of its Samuel Adams beer brand. Delightfully robust, Sam Adams won critical acclaim within the industry. According to a company press release, the brand won an unprecedented 125 international awards in its over three decades-long history.Fundamentally, Boston Beer obviously makes a case for sin stocks to consider because of its flagship product. It’s not a comfortable topic to discuss. However, scientific research demonstrates that the brain’s reaction to beer (I’d add good beer) makes it difficult to enjoy it judiciously. Essentially, we’re hardwired to drink more than one. Naturally, this cynically benefits SAM stock.The other factor of course focuses on the worsening economic environment. With major blue chips announcing or planning to implement huge layoffs, a rise in imbibing will likely materialize. To be clear, I’m not rooting for this dynamic. It’s just the reality of alcohol-related sin stocks at the moment.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)Source: ShutterstockOne of the classic sin stocks to buy, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is a stalwart in the brewery business. The company’s flagship product is Budweiser, which carries the unofficial title “The King of Beers.” Personally, I vigorously dispute this claim but that’s neither here nor there. Based on surveys and sales statistics, Bud and Bud Light routinely rank top among American consumers.As an investment in sin stocks, though, Anheuser-Busch may be quite a royal concept. Essentially, the company stands to benefit from the trade-down effect. Should economic pressures skyrocket, consumers are unlikely to go cold turkey in one swift transition. Instead, they’ll trade down their expensive beer for cheaper alternatives.Just as importantly, BUD sits on a relative discount. Since the beginning of the year, shares dipped over 12% in equity value. However, in the trailing month, they’re up nearly 22%. Investors may be recognizing the cynical opportunity, meaning you might want to act fast.RCI Hospitality (RICK)an empty stage at a night club with blue and purple lightsSource: shutterstock.com/IM_VISUALSPerhaps the most classic example of sin stocks to buy, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) represents an interesting idea. I don’t recommend necessarily looking up what the company does because it might lead to misunderstandings – it was for research, honest! Diplomatically, I’ll just say that RCI is a specialist in the fabric-free industry.If you didn’t quite get the euphemism, let’s put it this way. If you’re an ESG investor, RICK represents the antithesis of ESG. On the social side, controversies regarding exploitation exist. It’s not a family-friendly idea to be sure. What it is, though, is incredibly relevant on a cynical basis. According to precedent from the Great Recession, these establishments perform well amid economic downturns.Psychologically, such businesses may appeal to those who need some thrill in their lives after getting beaten down by corporate politics and pink slips. It’s not a savory idea among sin stocks but as history shows, it gets the job done.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This theory’s adherents think rate hikes make newly issued fixed-income products more attractive and reduce the appeal of stable income from equities. Some investors also argue that higher rates make it harder for companies to pay back debt, let alone sustain healthy dividend payouts. But neither argument holds up this year,” reported Institutional Investor.Instead, it has again been proven that companies with attractive yields tend to outperform even the worst of markets over time, as I noted on Nov. 7. Now, with just weeks to go before we bid adieu to 2022, we wanted to take a look at some of the juiciest dividend stocks of the year. I think these high-yielding dividend stocks will continue to outperform in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSPGSimon Property Group$117.18AFCGAFC Gamma$16.73ADCAgree Realty$70.30PLDPrologis$114.95KOCoca-Cola$62.08MOAltria Group$44.80KSSKohl’s$30.93Simon Property Group (SPG)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comWhile most of 2022 was miserable for dividend stocks such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), it’s a REIT well worth paying attention to. Indeed, with a solid yield of 6.1%, this $44 billion owner of shopping centers all around the world is worth a look.While we often hear about the “death of the mall,” occupancy rates for U.S. malls and outlets jumped to 94.5% in the third quarter, as compared to 92.8% in the same quarter last year. Not only were occupancy rates rising, but so were rental rates. In fact, rent per sq. ft. was $54.80, as of Sept. from $53.91 year over year. Better, Simon Property Group says it’s on track to achieve pre-COVID occupancy by New Year 2023.“The flight towards bricks and mortar is real,” CEO David Simon said, as quoted by Footwear News. “The returns on e-commerce just aren’t quite what everybody talked about.” In addition, since cutting its dividend in 2020, the company has raised its distribution six times since then, which tells us the company is on the mend.Story continuesSimon Property Group also just raised its 2022 guidance. The REIT now expects net income to fall in the range of $6.16 to $6.21 per diluted share. Additionally, it expects comparable FFO to be in a range of $11.83 to $11.88 per diluted share, which is an increase of 12 to 26 cents per diluted share.AFC Gamma (AFCG)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAt the moment, AFC Gamma (NASDAQ:AFCG) carries a dividend yield of 13.2%. I expect that dividend to remain intact, especially with more states and countries throughout Europe looking to legalize cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes. Additionally, I think federal legalization may be possible sooner than later, especially with such a large percentage of Americans in support of legalization.AFC Gamma is not a landlord. Instead, the company provides financing, such as mortgage and construction loans, to help cannabis companies that typically can’t secure traditional financing from banks. The company currently holds 13 loans across 17 states. In its most recent quarter, the REIT reported net income of $11.5 million, a 45% increase year-over-year. Distributable earnings were also up to $11.8 million, a 64% year-over-year improvement.Agree Realty (ADC)Source: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 4.1%, Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is another interesting real estate company I’ve been focusing on. Much of this has to do with the company’s business model, which is aimed at acquiring and developing properties that are net leased to industry-leading omnichannel retail tenants. These tenants include the likes of blue-chip names such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD).At the moment, this company has just under 36 million square feet of space it leases to those reliable investment-grade tenants. Better, as of September, the company acquired another 303 properties across 42 states for about $1.19 billion.This company’s growing property portfolio has allowed it to recently increase its monthly dividend to 24 cents per share, which amounts to $2.88 per share annualized. Even more impressive are its recent earnings. In its second quarter, the company posted revenue of $104.9 million, as compared to expectations of $102.3 million. Agree also increased its full-year acquisition guidance to a new range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.Prologis (PLD)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a warehouse REIT showing big signs of life again. At the moment, the REIT owns more than a billion square feet of real estate across 4,914 buildings in about 19 countries, with about $165 billion of assets under management. Better, the REIT has grown its dividend payout at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, making it among the top dividend stocks on my list right now. Currently, PLD stock yields 2.8%.Prologis is benefiting from a massive gap between rental rates on existing leases, and current market rates. So, as leases expire, Prologis is able to sign new leases at higher rates. Accordingly, the company anticipates its effective same-store net operating income (SSNOI) could grow between 8% and 10% for the next few years.Even better, the REIT is betting big on electric vehicles. Currently, Prologis is installing EV charging infrastructure in several large U.S. industrial markets. “Prologis is helping its customers transition their commercial fleets to zero emissions transportation, spanning heavy-duty trucks (18 wheels) to last-mile vans. With more than 1.2 billion square feet of logistics properties around the globe, deep development expertise, and relationships with some of the world’s largest brands, the company is uniquely positioned to help accelerate the adoption of electric fleets,” as noted by the company.Coca-Cola (KO)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockWith strong demand, dependable dividends, and incredible earnings growth, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best dividend stocks to consider as a long-term investment.Coca-Cola is also a dividend king, raising its dividend for the last 60+ years. This stock currently carries a yield of 2.9% and continues to be one of the safest stocks on the market. In addition, in its most recent quarter, the company posted earnings per share of 69 cents on sales of $11.1 billion. That’s up from the 65 cents on sales of $10 billion during the same quarter last year. Analysts were looking for 64 cents on sales of $10.5 billion.For the year, the company expects revenue growth to fall in the range of 14% and 15%, which is higher than its initial forecast of 12% to 13%. Coca-Cola also raised its growth estimates on adjusted earnings per share to a new range of 6% to 7%, from 5% to 6%. As a show of faith in the company, director Herb Allen just bought 33,200 shares for $2 million. That’s reason enough for me to be bullish on this stalwart company.Altria Group (MO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockCurrently, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) carries a yield of 8.5%. But that’s not the most impressive item of note for this top high-yielding dividend stock.Over the last 53 years, the company has raised its dividend 57 times, which makes it another Dividend King on this list. In fact, as of August, the company raised its dividend for the 57th time to $3.76 per share annually.Granted, sales of cigarettes are on the decline. However, vaping and e-cigarette use is on the rise. In fact, about one in 20 Americans now vape, with product sales expected to hit $40 billion by 2023. This is a trend Altria can capitalize on, with the help of a partnership the company recently entered into with Japan Tobacco to develop smoke-free products.Notably, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Pamela Kaufman raised the firm’s target price on MO to $109 from $102, with an overweight rating.Kohl’s (KSS)a bag on a table with the word ""dividends"" on it. represent dividend stocks to buySource: ShutterstockWith a yield of 6.5%, shares of Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) are attractive as a contrarian bet. This is among the most beaten-down dividend stocks of the year thanks to sky-high inflation, consumer cutbacks, poor earnings, slashed guidance, and supply chain issues. But don’t write the stock off just yet. Most of these issues are only temporary, and the company may soon see a solid turnaround. Plus, should inflation start to cool off, even more retailers like Kohl’s could be set up for a strong come back.One catalyst worth considering is that the company’s CEO just stepped down. Additionally, the company just announced preliminary earnings that were better than expected. Kohl’s now anticipates earnings per share to come in at 82 cents, as compared to expectations of 63 cents.If that’s not an indication that this is a top dividend stock to buy this holiday season, I don’t know what is.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:66% = US$11b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.66.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Parcel Service has a better ROE than the average (22%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining United Parcel Service's Debt And Its 66% Return On EquityUnited Parcel Service clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.18. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

For any number of reasons, such value stocks may have fallen out of favor with investors and analysts. As such, the share price trades below what it should be worth based on the company’s fundamentals such as its earnings and book value. Most value stocks are older, more established companies where shares are trading at depressed or bargain prices. Value investors are people who take a long-term approach and buy a stock that is currently undervalued with the expectation that it will appreciate over time as the market eventually takes into account the company’s overall financial health as well as its future earnings potential.In fact, many of the most successful investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, identify themselves as value investors. They’re always on the hunt for stocks of good companies that are undervalued but should eventually recover and trade higher. Here are seven value stocks you can count on in this uncertain market.VVisa$212.34UPSUnited Parcel Service$183.65TXNTexas Instruments$179.14CETCentral Securities$34.96URIUnited Rentals$360.81UNPUnion Pacific$211.95AMTAmerican Tower$218.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks: Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit card giant Visa’s (NYSE:V) stock is down 6% this year and 12% below its 52-week high of $235. The median price target on the stock is currently $248 a share, which is 20% higher than its current level. This presents a rare opportunity for value investors with a long time horizon to buy shares in a great American company at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. Over the past five years, V stock had gained 85%.V stock had been as low as $178 a share in mid-Oct. before the company issued better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. The San Francisco-based company reported that it earned $1.93 a share on revenues of $7.79 billion in the July through September period. Wall Street had forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on revenues of $7.55 billion. Visa also announced in Oct. that it’s raising its quarterly dividend by 20%, providing even more value to shareholders.Story continuesValue Stocks: United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockWith the exception of, perhaps, the holidays, shipping parcels around the world isn’t a very exciting business. But as the world’s largest shipping and logistics company with annual revenues in 2021 of $85 billion, Atlanta, Georgia-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is the kind of value stock that investors can buy on the cheap with expectations that it will deliver long-term gains. UPS stock is down 16% on the year and trading at $180 a share. But over the last five years, the share price has grown 60%, and it is up 157% over the past decade.The median price target on UPS stock is currently $196, or nearly 10% higher than where the shares currently trade. For all of this year, UPS is forecasting revenue of about $102 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%. The company also intends to payout $5.20 billion in dividends to shareholders, giving it a strong yield of 3.37%. The company also plans to buy back at least $3 billion of its own stock. UPS stock currently trades at 14 times future earnings, which is below the average among stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making UPS shares look comparatively cheap.Value Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockDallas-based Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the kind of mature company that Wall Street has fallen out of love with and investors tend to ignore. However, discounting TXN stock would be a mistake. Today, Texas Instruments is a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. Unbeknownst to most people, the company is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world.TXN stock is down 10% this year and currently trading at $172 a share. However, over the last five years the shares have climbed 74% higher. Looking out 10 years, the stock has gained nearly 500%. If the share price appreciation isn’t enticing enough, consider also that Texas Instruments pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.76%. In addition, the stock looks quite undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more.Central Securities (CET)closed-end funds (CEFs)Source: ShutterstockCentral Securities (NYSEAMERICAN:CET) is a closed-end fund that offers great value to investors. In operation since 1929, Central Securities has been led since the 1970s by Wilmot Kidd III. While Kidd is also not a household name, he is regarded by many in professional investing circles as one of the greatest investors of all-time and the equal of Warren Buffett in terms of his returns.When Kidd took over Central Securities in 1974, the fund had $34 million in assets under management. Today that figure is $1.3 billion. While unknown to most, Central Securities has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A /BRK.B) over the past two decades. Central Securities has returned an annualized 14.5% with dividends reinvested to shareholders over the past 48 years, beating an 11.7% return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the same timeframe.Central Securities holds concentrated positions in a select number of stocks, some of which it has owned for 40 years. The company first bought Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock in 1986, and spent $700,000 to establish a position in private insurer Plymouth Rock back in 1982. The Plymouth Rock investment is worth more than $295 million today. Central Securities also has an extremely low expense ratio of less than 1% and has a history of paying outsized dividends. Down 23% this year, CET stock is a steal at its current price of $34 a share.United Rentals (URI)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockStamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world.  The company also boasts the biggest fleet of construction vehicles for rent on the planet. While URI stock has performed well, it gets scant attention from the media or public and continues to trade at levels that suggest it is undervalued. Year-to-date, United Rentals stock is up 6% and trading at $349 a share. That’s a significant outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500 that is down 18% in 2022. Over five years, the stock is up 128%.However, a price-earnings ratio of 12 is low and indicates that URI stock is trading at a discount right now. The median price target on the stock is $387.50, implying 11% upside from here.

The median price target on the stock is $240 a share, which would be about 10% above where it is currently trading. AMT stock also pays a solid quarterly dividend that yields 2.67%.

Shares have added about 16% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Moody's due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Moody's Q3 Earnings Miss, Revenues Decline Y/YMoody's reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06. The bottom line also plunged 31% from the year-ago quarter figure.Subdued issuance volume was a major headwind, which hurt Moody’s results. A rise in operating expenses posed an undermining factor. However, strategic buyouts strengthened the MA segment’s performance. The company’s liquidity position was robust during the quarter.After taking into consideration certain non-recurring items, net income attributable to Moody's Corporation was $303 million or $1.65 per share, down from $474 million or $2.53 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Down, Costs UpRevenues were $1.28 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion. The top line declined 16% year over year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by 4%.Total expenses were $873 million, up 1%. The rise was mainly due to operational and transaction-related costs related to the recent acquisitions. Foreign currency translation positively impacted operating expenses by 5%.Adjusted operating income of $497 million was down 33%. Adjusted operating margin was 39%, down from 48.3% a year ago.Mixed Segment PerformanceMoody’s Investors Service revenues plunged 36% year over year to $590 million.

QuoteFactors to NoteAccelerating cloud migration and data-driven digital transformation by businesses across the globe are likely to have driven demand for NetApp’s product portfolio. The continuation of work-from-home and hybrid-work innovation are other driving factors. NetApp specializes in providing cloud services, systems and software to business organizations for optimal operations of applications from the data center to cloud.NetApp’s strengthening go-to-market activities, various cloud collaborations and continued product innovation amid a robust demand environment are likely to have acted as additional tailwinds. Synergies from the buyouts of CloudCheckr and Data Mechanics bode well. NetApp’s recent buyouts include Fylamynt and Instaclustr.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Hybrid Cloud segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.52 billion. Strength in the company’s object storage and all-flash business is expected to have contributed to the Hybrid Cloud segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Software product revenues are likely to have gained from the favorable mix shift to the all-flash portfolio.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Public Cloud Services revenues is pegged at $151 million.Story continuesRenewed momentum in Spot by NetApp portfolio might have aided the Public Cloud Services business along with strong demand for other cloud solutions like Azure NetApp files, Cloud Volumes and Cloud Insights services. Spot by NetApp enables enterprises to make multi-cloud management easier and lower expenses at the same time. Incremental gains from an uptick in the company’s NetApp Astra solution and NetApp ONTAP data management software might have favored the top line.However, unfavorable forex movements, lingering supply chain troubles and substantial increases in freight and logistical, and component costs are likely to have acted as headwinds.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.NetApp has an Earnings ESP of -1.25% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Shares have added about 9.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pentair plc due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Pentair Earnings and Sales Surpass Estimates in Q3Pentair reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 99 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the company’s guidance of 93 cents to 95 cents and improved 11% from the 89 cents reported in the prior-year. Pricing actions helped offset the impact of the ongoing inflation in costs, leading to an improvement in earnings.Including one-time items, EPS was 70 cents compared with the prior-year quarter’s 86 cents.Net sales improved 9% year over year to $1.06 billion in the quarter under review and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, core sales grew 4% in the quarter.The cost of sales advanced 11% year over year to $707 million. The gross profit in the reported quarter amounted to $348 million, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The gross margin was 33.0% compared with the year-ago quarter’s 34.5%.SG&amp;A expenses totaled $177 million which surged 22% from the prior-year quarter’s $158 million. Research and development expenses were up 8% year over year to $23.7 million.The operating income in the quarter was $147 million, down 12% year over year. The adjusted segmental operating income increased 15% year over year to $207 million. The segment margin came in at 19.6% in the reported quarter, a 110 basis-point expansion from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceNet sales in the Consumer Solutions segment moved up 8% year over year to $665 million. The segment’s operating earnings increased 10% year over year to $159 million.Net sales in the Industrial and Flow Technologies segment totaled $390 million, up 10% from the prior-year quarter. Operating earnings for the segment rose 25% year over year to $65.7 million.Financial UpdatePentair had cash and cash equivalents of around $119 million at the end of the third quarter compared with $94.5 million at 2021-end. Net cash generated from operating activities was around $271.5 million in the first nine-month period of the current year compared with $540.4 million in the prior-year period. The company had long-term debt of $2,448 million as of Sep 30, 2022, up from $894 million as of Dec 31, 2021.PNR completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, a leading provider of commercial ice makers, in July 2022. The integration is currently underway. Manitowoc Ice brings a complementary global commercial presence that will expand Pentair’s end-to-end water filtration and ice solution offerings for food service customers.GuidancePentair now expects the adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 to be around $3.65. Previously, the company had provided a range for adjusted EPS guidance between $3.70 and $3.76. The sales growth projection for the year is currently at 9%, compared to the 8-10% band expected earlier.For the fourth quarter of 2022, PNR expects adjusted EPS at around 79 cents.

149,6929a611-82f1-3489-a938-fb7c116f3a5e,OXY,2022-11-25,What Warren Buffett Sees in OXY Stock,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-sees-oxy-stock-111706313.html,1669115826,STORY,"['OXY', 'CL=F']","[You may have heard that legendary investor Warren Buffett likes Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock. If you want to be like Buffett, you might wonder what he sees in it. As it turns out, there’s plenty to like about Occidental Petroleum’s financials. Plus, value and growth investors can both find reasons to invest today.Is it actually possible to have value and “momo” or momentum in the same stock? It might seem inconceivable that a single investment can have price propulsion but also be cheap. Yet, as we’ll discover today, it is possible.Just remember, Buffett doesn’t like shady or unprofitable businesses, and his investment time horizon is very long. So, be patient and conduct your due diligence if you want to invest like Buffett – and take a close look at Occidental Petroleum before the opportunity slips through your hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$69.59OXY Stock Moved Higher but Is Still a BargainSure, you can call OXY a “momo” stock since it has more than doubled in 2022. There’s no denying that growth investors should be pleased with this result.On the other hand, Occidental Petroleum has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.86x. Clearly, there’s a terrific bargain here. Also, income investors should be glad to learn that the company pays a forward annual dividend yield of 0.72%.Now, we’re starting to see why Buffett might favor OXY stock. It’s also good to know that macro-level conditions should benefit Occidental Petroleum.The Energy Information Administration or EIA reported that, during the week ending Nov. 11, crude oil inventories declined 5.4 million barrels. Meanwhile, analysts only expected a decrease of 400,000 barrels. Hence, it appears that there’s an unexpectedly tight oil supply, which could buoy the crude oil price as well as the Occidental Petroleum share price.Story continuesOccidental Is a Cash-Rich, Profitable BusinessOf course, Buffett doesn’t just like a company because it’s trading at a bargain valuation. The company itself has to be rock-solid. In that regard, Occidental Petroleum passes with flying colors.For one thing, Occidental Petroleum ended September with a whopping $1.233 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. In other words, this is a well-capitalized business that should easily be able to fund its future operations.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum repurchased over 28.4 million of its own shares during 2022’s third quarter. Large-scale share buybacks are often a sign of the management’s confidence in a company.Also in Q3 2022, Occidental generated $9.501 billion in revenue, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $9.354 billion. Not only that, but the company reported quarterly income of $2.546 billion, showing a huge improvement over the $628 million from the year-earlier quarter.What You Can Do NowAll of the puzzle pieces are in place for Warren Buffett to like Occidental Petroleum. There’s the “momo” angle, yes, but Buffett is probably more focused on the deep value that OXY stock offers.So, feel free to do what the Oracle of Omaha himself would do. Most likely, he would conduct thorough research on Occidental Petroleum. Then, if you’re ready to add some shares, now’s a great time as they’re likely to be much more expensive five, 10 and 20 years from now.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in OXY.

151,2025f8c5-a418-37a6-8af1-6908d7898eff,ULTA,2022-11-25,Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-ulta-reports-next-150003269.html,1669302003,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.19 billion, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?For Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.17%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ulta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $4.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.70, delivering a surprise of +14.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ulta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Five Below (FIVE) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -67.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $611.16 million, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Five Below has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 10.31%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Five Below will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BMRN increased 7.3% on Nov 23 on investors’ optimism about the FDA’s decision to not hold an advisory committee (AdCom) meeting to review the company’s biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval for Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec or valrox) gene therapy.The BLA, currently under FDA’s review, seeks approval for Roctavianas a treatment for adult patients with severe hemophilia A. FDA’s final decision is expected by Mar 31, 2023. If approved, Roctavian would become the first gene therapy for treating severe hemophilia A in the United States.The FDA’s latest decision to waive holding an AdCom meeting also indicates that the additional data submitted by BMRN satisfies its earlier concerns.

Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Coke due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Coca-Cola Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesCoca-Cola has reported better-than-expected top and bottom-line results for third-quarter 2022. The company’s results have benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Driven by the strong results, the company has raised its growth expectations for organic revenues and comparable earnings per share for 2022.Comparable earnings of 69 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of 64 cents and rose 7% from the year-ago period. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt earnings by 11 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 18%.Revenues of $11,063 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,600 million and improved 10% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $10,557.8 million. Organic revenues rose 16% from the prior-year quarter. Coca-Cola’s top line benefited from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales.In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. The company benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Volume and PricingIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales advanced 4% year over year, while the price/mix rose 12%. The price/mix benefited from pricing actions in the marketplace across all operating segments, coupled with a favorable channel and package mix, owing to the lapping of last year’s pandemic-led disruptions. Price/mix also gained from a positive segment mix.Coca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 4% in the third quarter, backed by strength across all operating segments, ongoing investments in the marketplace and strength in the away-from-home channel. Growth was mainly led by improved trends in the developed markets, which recorded mid-single digits growth. Meanwhile, the developing and emerging markets rose in the low-single digits. Growth in developed markets was driven by Mexico, Western Europe and the United States. The developing and emerging markets benefited from growth in India, China and Brazil.Coming to the category cluster performance, volume benefited in the reported quarter from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Sparkling soft drinks’ unit case volume improved 3% year over year, driven by robust gains across all geographic operating segments, led by India, Mexico and China. Trademark Coca-Cola volumes were up 3% year over year on solid gains in all regions. The sparkling flavors category improved 3% on growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin America. The volume for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar rose 11% on double-digit growth across developed markets, and high-single-digit growth across developing and emerging markets.Volume for nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages was flat. The category primarily gained from fairlife in the United States, Minute Maid Pulpy in China and Maaza in India, offset by declines in local brands in Eastern Europe.The hydration, sports, coffee and tea category grew 5% in the third quarter. Coca-Cola witnessed 6% growth in hydration on improvements across the Asia Pacific and Latin America. Sports drinks rose 6% due to solid performances by Aquarius, BODYARMOR and Powerade. Tea volume was flat, as gains in Brazil and Mexico were offset by a decline due to the suspension of business in Russia. The coffee business witnessed 5% growth on the cycling impacts of the closure of Costa retail outlets in the U.K. in the prior year and the expansion of Costa coffee across markets.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues rose 4% for EMEA, 12% for Latin America, 21% for North America, 4% for the Asia Pacific and 7% for Bottling Investments, while the same declined 10% for Global Ventures.Organic revenues improved 20% in EMEA, 18% in Latin America, 14% in North America, 14% in the Asia Pacific, 5% in Global Ventures and 19% in Bottling Investments.MarginsIn dollar terms, the operating income increased 7% year over year to $3,088 million, including a 10-point impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating income rose 8.1% year over year. Comparable currency-neutral operating income advanced 18% on strong organic revenue growth across all segments, offset by higher operating costs and marketing investments.The operating margin of 27.9% in the third quarter contracted 100 basis points (bps) from 28.9% in the prior-year quarter. The comparable operating margin contracted 50 bps to 29.5%, driven by increased operating costs, higher marketing investments, the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds, which more than offset growth in the top line.GuidanceCoca-Cola, on Mar 8, 2022, suspended its business in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine. As a result, it expects a 1% impact on unit case volume, along with a 1% impact on revenues and operating income (earlier 1-2% impact). Adjusted earnings are likely to be affected by 3 cents.Management has also raised its organic revenue forecast for 2022. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 14-15% compared with 12-13% growth mentioned earlier. Comparable revenues are expected to be impacted by a 7% currency headwind compared with a 6% headwind stated earlier. The guidance includes a 2% positive impact from acquisition and divestiture.Management expects an impact of a high-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on comparable cost of goods sold. The company anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19% compared with 19.5% mentioned earlier.Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share are estimated to increase 15-16% compared with 14-15% growth mentioned earlier. The company anticipates comparable earnings per share growth of 6-7% compared with 5-6% growth mentioned earlier. Its earnings per share view includes a headwind of 9% from currency and 1% from acquisitions and divestitures.For fourth-quarter 2022, comparable revenues are expected to include an 8% currency headwind and a 1% positive impact from acquisitions. Comparable earnings per share are estimated to include a currency headwind of 9%.Management envisions an adjusted free cash flow of $10.5 billion for 2022, including $12 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditure is likely to be $1.5 billion.The company has also provided its initial view for 2023. It remains optimistic about the top-line momentum. However, KO expects global inflation to impact expenses across the board in 2023. It expects commodity prices to continue to be volatile. The company anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19.5% for 2023.For 2023, comparable revenues are expected to include a 5-6% currency headwind. Comparable earnings per share are estimated to include a currency headwind of 7-8%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.17% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Coke has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Coke has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCoke is part of the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry.

157,f8acc422-af01-31aa-ac92-9c3e461c8f42,KO,2022-11-25,7 Juicy Dividends to Be Thankful For This Year,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-juicy-dividends-thankful-014119260.html,1669081279,STORY,"['PLD', 'SPG', 'AFCG', 'MO', 'KO', 'ADC']","[High-yielding dividend stocks have been some of the safest investments of 2022.In fact, “The recent outperformance of dividend stocks is contrary to the traditional wisdom that they tend to lag the overall market in a rising-rate environment. This theory’s adherents think rate hikes make newly issued fixed-income products more attractive and reduce the appeal of stable income from equities. Some investors also argue that higher rates make it harder for companies to pay back debt, let alone sustain healthy dividend payouts. But neither argument holds up this year,” reported Institutional Investor.Instead, it has again been proven that companies with attractive yields tend to outperform even the worst of markets over time, as I noted on Nov. 7. Now, with just weeks to go before we bid adieu to 2022, we wanted to take a look at some of the juiciest dividend stocks of the year. I think these high-yielding dividend stocks will continue to outperform in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSPGSimon Property Group$117.18AFCGAFC Gamma$16.73ADCAgree Realty$70.30PLDPrologis$114.95KOCoca-Cola$62.08MOAltria Group$44.80KSSKohl’s$30.93Simon Property Group (SPG)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comWhile most of 2022 was miserable for dividend stocks such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), it’s a REIT well worth paying attention to. Indeed, with a solid yield of 6.1%, this $44 billion owner of shopping centers all around the world is worth a look.While we often hear about the “death of the mall,” occupancy rates for U.S. malls and outlets jumped to 94.5% in the third quarter, as compared to 92.8% in the same quarter last year. Not only were occupancy rates rising, but so were rental rates. In fact, rent per sq. ft. was $54.80, as of Sept. from $53.91 year over year. Better, Simon Property Group says it’s on track to achieve pre-COVID occupancy by New Year 2023.“The flight towards bricks and mortar is real,” CEO David Simon said, as quoted by Footwear News. “The returns on e-commerce just aren’t quite what everybody talked about.” In addition, since cutting its dividend in 2020, the company has raised its distribution six times since then, which tells us the company is on the mend.Story continuesSimon Property Group also just raised its 2022 guidance. The REIT now expects net income to fall in the range of $6.16 to $6.21 per diluted share. Additionally, it expects comparable FFO to be in a range of $11.83 to $11.88 per diluted share, which is an increase of 12 to 26 cents per diluted share.AFC Gamma (AFCG)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAt the moment, AFC Gamma (NASDAQ:AFCG) carries a dividend yield of 13.2%. I expect that dividend to remain intact, especially with more states and countries throughout Europe looking to legalize cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes. Additionally, I think federal legalization may be possible sooner than later, especially with such a large percentage of Americans in support of legalization.AFC Gamma is not a landlord. Instead, the company provides financing, such as mortgage and construction loans, to help cannabis companies that typically can’t secure traditional financing from banks. The company currently holds 13 loans across 17 states. In its most recent quarter, the REIT reported net income of $11.5 million, a 45% increase year-over-year. Distributable earnings were also up to $11.8 million, a 64% year-over-year improvement.Agree Realty (ADC)Source: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 4.1%, Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is another interesting real estate company I’ve been focusing on. Much of this has to do with the company’s business model, which is aimed at acquiring and developing properties that are net leased to industry-leading omnichannel retail tenants. These tenants include the likes of blue-chip names such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD).At the moment, this company has just under 36 million square feet of space it leases to those reliable investment-grade tenants. Better, as of September, the company acquired another 303 properties across 42 states for about $1.19 billion.This company’s growing property portfolio has allowed it to recently increase its monthly dividend to 24 cents per share, which amounts to $2.88 per share annualized. Even more impressive are its recent earnings. In its second quarter, the company posted revenue of $104.9 million, as compared to expectations of $102.3 million. Agree also increased its full-year acquisition guidance to a new range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.Prologis (PLD)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a warehouse REIT showing big signs of life again. At the moment, the REIT owns more than a billion square feet of real estate across 4,914 buildings in about 19 countries, with about $165 billion of assets under management. Better, the REIT has grown its dividend payout at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, making it among the top dividend stocks on my list right now. Currently, PLD stock yields 2.8%.Prologis is benefiting from a massive gap between rental rates on existing leases, and current market rates. So, as leases expire, Prologis is able to sign new leases at higher rates. Accordingly, the company anticipates its effective same-store net operating income (SSNOI) could grow between 8% and 10% for the next few years.Even better, the REIT is betting big on electric vehicles. Currently, Prologis is installing EV charging infrastructure in several large U.S. industrial markets. “Prologis is helping its customers transition their commercial fleets to zero emissions transportation, spanning heavy-duty trucks (18 wheels) to last-mile vans. With more than 1.2 billion square feet of logistics properties around the globe, deep development expertise, and relationships with some of the world’s largest brands, the company is uniquely positioned to help accelerate the adoption of electric fleets,” as noted by the company.Coca-Cola (KO)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockWith strong demand, dependable dividends, and incredible earnings growth, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best dividend stocks to consider as a long-term investment.Coca-Cola is also a dividend king, raising its dividend for the last 60+ years. This stock currently carries a yield of 2.9% and continues to be one of the safest stocks on the market. In addition, in its most recent quarter, the company posted earnings per share of 69 cents on sales of $11.1 billion. That’s up from the 65 cents on sales of $10 billion during the same quarter last year. Analysts were looking for 64 cents on sales of $10.5 billion.For the year, the company expects revenue growth to fall in the range of 14% and 15%, which is higher than its initial forecast of 12% to 13%. Coca-Cola also raised its growth estimates on adjusted earnings per share to a new range of 6% to 7%, from 5% to 6%. As a show of faith in the company, director Herb Allen just bought 33,200 shares for $2 million. That’s reason enough for me to be bullish on this stalwart company.Altria Group (MO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockCurrently, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) carries a yield of 8.5%. But that’s not the most impressive item of note for this top high-yielding dividend stock.Over the last 53 years, the company has raised its dividend 57 times, which makes it another Dividend King on this list. In fact, as of August, the company raised its dividend for the 57th time to $3.76 per share annually.Granted, sales of cigarettes are on the decline. However, vaping and e-cigarette use is on the rise. In fact, about one in 20 Americans now vape, with product sales expected to hit $40 billion by 2023. This is a trend Altria can capitalize on, with the help of a partnership the company recently entered into with Japan Tobacco to develop smoke-free products.Notably, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Pamela Kaufman raised the firm’s target price on MO to $109 from $102, with an overweight rating.Kohl’s (KSS)a bag on a table with the word ""dividends"" on it. represent dividend stocks to buySource: ShutterstockWith a yield of 6.5%, shares of Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) are attractive as a contrarian bet. This is among the most beaten-down dividend stocks of the year thanks to sky-high inflation, consumer cutbacks, poor earnings, slashed guidance, and supply chain issues. But don’t write the stock off just yet. Most of these issues are only temporary, and the company may soon see a solid turnaround. Plus, should inflation start to cool off, even more retailers like Kohl’s could be set up for a strong come back.One catalyst worth considering is that the company’s CEO just stepped down. Additionally, the company just announced preliminary earnings that were better than expected. Kohl’s now anticipates earnings per share to come in at 82 cents, as compared to expectations of 63 cents.If that’s not an indication that this is a top dividend stock to buy this holiday season, I don’t know what is.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

158,e2f62ca4-8235-3178-97fe-f837607abff4,WY,2022-11-25,15 Biggest Lumber Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-lumber-companies-world-121855807.html,1669378735,STORY,"['IFSPF', 'WY', 'CFPZF']","[We will take a look at the 15 biggest lumber companies in the world. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Lumber Companies in the World.Lumber is sawn wood that has been converted into beams, planks, or boards, through wood production. It is mainly used for construction framing as well as for other homebuilding uses such as flooring, wall panels, windowpanes, etc. In addition, lumber is also used for making furniture. Softwood lumber, made from coniferous species such as pine, fir, and spruce, is supplied in standard sizes for construction purposes and accounts for the majority of lumber production.Lumber Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, China accounted for a quarter of the global consumption of sawn wood in 2020, followed by United States at 22% and Germany at 5% of the global consumption. On the production side of things, China led the charts with 18% of the global production, followed by United States with 17% and Russia with 9%, during the same year.Similar to the other major industries across the globe, the lumber industry was also severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The lockdowns and other precautionary measures resulted in significant production constraints during the last two years, leading to lumber shortages.The prices for lumber hit their all-time peak at $1,695 per 1000 board feet in May 2021. The prices later went down as far as $454 per 1000 board feet in August 2021 and picked up once again to reach $1,465 per 1000 board feet by February 2022. Lumber prices have taken a tumble since March 2022 and currently reside at $432 per 1000 board feet, more than 70% below their peak earlier this year.The recent drop in lumber prices can be equally attributed to the recovery of the supply side as well as the demand destruction caused by the rising inflation and resultant interest rate hikes implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Increased cost of capital has led to a slowdown in the housing market which is the largest consumer of the lumber production.Story continuesThere is potential for a remarkable recovery in the housing market by late 2023 which would lift the lumber industry as well.We have picked the top 15 companies across the globe based on their softwood lumber production figures for 2021. The list includes companies from several continents and includes privately owned companies as well as publicly listed companies.

(NYSE:WM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$2.0b in market cap last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 0.5% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Waste Management. View our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Waste Management's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 7.5% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Waste Management, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$119m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Waste Management. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NASDAQ:INTU) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Intuit's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Intuit peKeen to find out how analysts think Intuit's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Intuit's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Intuit's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 3.4%. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 23% overall rise in EPS. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 22% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Intuit's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Intuit's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Intuit maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Intuit.You might be able to find a better investment than Intuit.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Trane Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Evoqua Water has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that TT's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.03, while AQUA has a forward P/E of 47.13. We also note that TT has a PEG ratio of 2.13. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AQUA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.14.Another notable valuation metric for TT is its P/B ratio of 7.04. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AQUA has a P/B of 7.55.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, TT holds a Value grade of B, while AQUA has a Value grade of C.TT sticks out from AQUA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that TT is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 16.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GE due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.General Electric Q3 Earnings Miss, Revenues BeatGeneral Electric reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 57 cents from non-recurring items) of 35 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. The bottom line declined significantly year over year.Total revenues of $19,084 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,035 million. The top line increased in low-single digits year over year.Segmental DiscussionAerospace revenues jumped 24% year over year to $6,705 million in the reported quarter, driven by growth in commercial services due to a significant increase in shop visits, strong spare part sales and favorable prices. Organic revenues rose 25% year over year. Orders grew 6% year over year. Organic orders also increased by the same amount.Healthcare revenues in the reported quarter totaled $4,613 million, up 6% year over year. Revenues increased 10% organically. Growth in imaging and ultrasound boosted segmental revenues. Orders were flat on a reported basis but increased 4% organically.Renewable Energy revenues totaled $3,594 million, down 15% year over year. Organically, the same declined 10%. Results were hurt by lower U.S. onshore wind volumes. Orders dropped 43% year over year on a reported basis and 41% organically.The Power segment’s revenues were down 12% year over year to $3,529 million. Organic revenues declined 5%. Softness in aero-derivative unit shipments at Gas Power and the exit of the new build coal business at Steam weighed on the segment’s performance. Orders climbed 14% on a reported basis and 20% organically.Story continuesMargin ProfileIn the quarter under review, General Electric’s cost of sales (cost of equipment sold+ cost of services sold) ascended 7.2% year over year to $14,371 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.5% year over year to $2,868 million.

Power segment reported a profit of $141 million, down 31% year over year.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowExiting the third quarter, General Electric had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $12,596 million compared with $15,770 million at the end of December 2021. The company’s long-term borrowings were $26,121 million at the end of the third quarter compared with $30,824 million at the end of December 2021.Adjusted free cash flow in the reported quarter was $1,189 million, down 11.5% year over year.General Electric repurchased around 4.5 million shares for $300 million during the third quarter.OutlookGeneral Electric expects organic revenues to grow in the low-end of high-single-digit growth range for 2022. The company estimates adjusted organic profit margin to expand 125-150 basis points in the year. Adjusted earnings are predicted in the band of $2.40-$2.80 per share. The mid-point of the guided range — $2.60 — falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69. GE expects a free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion for the ongoing year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, GE has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, GE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerGE is part of the Zacks Diversified Operations industry. Over the past month, Danaher (DHR), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3.8%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Danaher reported revenues of $7.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6%.

167,8d5f33c8-8b07-3db1-85f8-33446bcf4be6,UNH,2022-11-25,Possible bearish signals as UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) insiders disposed of US$35m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-unitedhealth-group-110021166.html,1669374021,STORY,['UNH'],"[Over the past year, many UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$530. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.0m for 2.24k shares. But insiders sold 69.33k shares worth US$35m. All up, insiders sold more shares in UnitedHealth Group than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At UnitedHealth Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of UnitedHealth Group shares. In total, Senior VP &amp; Chief Accounting Officer Thomas Roos sold US$252k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes UnitedHealth Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.7b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth Group Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought UnitedHealth Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since UnitedHealth Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of UnitedHealth Group.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Jain's history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to the Was Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners Right About These 5 Stocks?.We prepared the actual contents of this article in November 2021, when we analyzed the Q3 portfolio of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners to discuss the top 10 picks of the hedge fund at that time. We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong. In this article you will see the top 10 stock picks of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners as of the third quarter of last year. To assess the performance of these stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months. At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. It’d be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analysts’ price targets and calls.Serving as its chairman and chief investment officer, Rajiv Jain is the founder of the Florida-based investment management firm, GQG Partners, as well as the lead portfolio manager for all GQG Partners strategies. He commenced investment operations at GQG Partners in 2016 with over 26 years of investment experience. Previously, Rajiv Jain served as a co-portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in 1994, where he later on became co-chief executive officer, chief investment officer and head of equities, serving as the sole portfolio manager of the International Equities strategy and Emerging Markets Equities strategy, and the lead portfolio manager for the Global Equities strategy at the firm. Prior to that, he was an international equity analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation.Story continuesSome of the top stocks in the investment portfolio of GQG Partners at the end of the third quarter of 2021 included Alphabet Inc.

Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.35 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: +8%Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a multinational cigarette and tobacco product manufacturing company based in New York. With products sold in over 180 countries, its most recognized and famous brands include Marlboro.According to GQG Partners' 13F filings for the third quarter of 2021, the fund holds over 14.2 million shares of Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth more than $1.39 billion, representing 3.69% of the fund's portfolio value.Terry Smith of Fundsmith LLP is one of the biggest stakeholders of Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM) as of the end of the third quarter, according to the data tracked by Insider Monkey. Overall, 48 funds were bullish on the company by the end of Q3, compared to 46 in the previous quarter.9. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.37 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -41%Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a Connecticut-based telecommunications and mass media company that provides broadband communications and entertainment services.According to the third quarter securities filings, Rajiv Jain's hedge fund owned over 1.88 million shares in Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) worth $1.37 billion and representing 3.76% of the portfolio value.On November 22, Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould lowered the price target on Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) to $730 from $815, and kept a Hold rating on the shares after assuming coverage of the company. The analyst notes that Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) reported a mixed quarter, with solid financials but weak subscribers.In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included communication services, where Charter trailed after generating robust returns earlier in the recovery.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.4 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: +17%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a multinational healthcare and insurance company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. One of the largest companies in the world based on revenue, it provides healthcare products, health care coverage, software, and data consultancy services.Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners currently holds over 3.6 million shares of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These shares are valued at $1.4 billion and account for 3.87% of the investment firm's portfolio.On November 16, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised his price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $477 from $421, and kept a Buy rating on the shares of the company after the quarterly filing release.Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boykin Curry's Eagle Capital Management is one of the leading shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  (NYSE:UNH), with 3 million shares worth approximately $1.2 billion.Wedgewood Partners mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q3 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group detracted from performance due to investor concerns about Medicare premiums as well as post-COVID medical cost trends. Medicare enrollment should continue to grow at double-digits at UnitedHealthcare. Meanwhile the Company’s Optum segment should be able to help bend the cost curve if indeed post-COVID volumes pick up to above pre-COVID levels. In any case, we do not think the long-term normalized trend of medical care in the U.S. has changed substantially and would look to add to our new position on any continuing short-term concerns.”7. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.56 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: +78%Based in Irving, Texas, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s largest multinational oil and gas companies that manufactures and transports crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Although the U.S Energy sector has posted strong gains year-to-date, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) seems to have lagged due to its late transition into the sector.Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners owns over 26.5 million shares in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), valued at $1.56 billion, making up 4.28% of the fund’s 13F portfolio. Of the 867 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 64 reported holding stakes in the company by the end of the third quarter. Jean-Marie Eviellard of First Eagle Investment Management is among the leading shareholders in the company.On October 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott kept an Overweight ratings on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), alongside an $84 price target on the company's shares.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, First Eagle Investment Management stated that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of the leading contributors in the fund for the quarter. Here is what they said:“Leading contributors in the First Eagle Global Fund this quarter included Exxon Mobil Corporation. The continued recovery in oil prices as economies reopen helped fuel another strong performance across the energy complex, including shares of Exxon Mobil. Exxon Mobil recently lost a proxy fight with an activist investor that took three of the company’s 12 board seats. While the press was focused on the investor’s concerns over Exxon Mobil’s long term energy transformation strategy, other factors fundamental to shareholder returns—like capital discipline and balance sheet management—were also at play.”6. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)GQG Partners' Stake Value: $1.68 billion  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -26%One of the Big Five US Tech corporations, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational firm based in Washington. Known for its computer software and operating systems, it recently became the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, with a market capitalization of $2.53 trillion at market close.GQG Partners owns 5.97 million shares in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as of the third quarter, worth $1.68 billion, representing 4.6% of the firm’s 13F portfolio.Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“After modest Portfolio activity during the second quarter of 2021, activity increased during the third quarter. We would broadly characterize the various trades into two objectives: 1) managing risk, and 2) managing valuation. In both cases, we aimed to maintain the Portfolio’s growth profile. In aggregate, we believe we were able to increase expected earnings growth while reducing risk and the overall portfolio valuation… We also trimmed Microsoft, which had grown to nearly 10% of the Portfolio. At an 8% weighting, it still represents one of our largest positions.” Click to continue reading and see Was Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners Right About These 5 Stocks?.

170,b3bd514a-6d69-39f3-ac2e-10df7dbb9dd3,PG,2022-11-25,The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Investors Are Less Pessimistic Than Expected,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-nyse-pg-130239381.html,1669381359,STORY,['PG'],"[The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 24.3x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Procter &amp; Gamble could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble peKeen to find out how analysts think Procter &amp; Gamble's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Procter &amp; Gamble's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 5.3% last year. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 275% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 4.4% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it concerning that Procter &amp; Gamble is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Procter &amp; Gamble's P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Procter &amp; Gamble's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Procter &amp; Gamble, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

With a host of digital and on-ground activities in collaboration with physicians, pharmacists, medical and partner associations, the campaign aims to raise public awareness on iron deficiency, the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide contributing to ~50% of all cases of anaemia.[1]Iron is an essential micronutrient, required to produce the haemoglobin found in our red blood cells which acts as the principal carrier of oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can lead to Iron Deficiency Anaemia. Iron affects Blood Health and plays an important role in maintaining energy levels as well as supporting normal brain function, muscle function, immune response and healthy pregnancies.Symptoms of iron deficiency include tiredness, paleness, and dizziness which are usually mistaken for the lack of sleep, a lack of exercise and poor diet. An estimated 1 in 3 women suffer from Iron Deficiency symptoms including tiredness[1,2,3] and dizziness[4,5]. Symptoms if left unchecked and underdiagnosed impact quality of life and vitality of consumers.Aalok Agarwal, Senior Vice-President, P&amp;G Health, Asia, India, Middle East &amp; Africa shared, ""P&amp;G Health has been a leading voice on Blood Health with continuous efforts aimed at empowering 750 million consumers in Asia to break free from Iron Deficiency and build back their vitality.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +11.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has gained 12.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of +0.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.23 indicates a change of +6.9% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $20.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.1%. The $79.4 billion and $82.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1% and +3.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.57 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +1.29%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 10 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks. As high-interest rates and inflation have pulled down the market this year, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors. The fears of possible recession have distressed investors regarding the falling value of their portfolios. Quarterly or monthly dividends are rewarding for investors as they can help them glide through these difficult times. Dividend Kings like 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) have outperformed the broader market this year so far, as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth track records. Moreover, their strong fundamentals and improving balance sheets help them smoothly manage and deliver shareholder returns.According to a recent report published by JPMorgan Asset Management, dividend stocks prop up the market during inflationary periods as strong companies avoid slashing their dividends even after reporting earnings decline. As dividends are still recovering from the ill effects of the pandemic of 2020, dividend payout ratios are currently at low levels, which is faring well for dividend companies and eventually for investors. The report sheds light on the performance of dividend stocks during previous inflations. It referred to the data by Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and JPMorgan Asset Management, mentioning that dividends represented 3.3%, 4.2%, and 4.4% of the total market returns during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, respectively. The report also concluded that dividends remain more stable than earnings when markets fall into a recession.Fidelity Investments also weighed up the dividend companies’ performance in its September report. The report mentioned that dividends represented 40% of the stock market returns since 1930 and 54% during decades of high inflation. It also mentioned that companies that raise their dividends during inflationary periods outperform the broader market because of positive investor sentiment.Story continuesFurther elaborating on the dividend investment, we will discuss the highest-paying monthly dividend stocks in this article.25 Highest-Paying Monthly Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that offer monthly payouts to shareholders.

174,912484d3-afe5-37ac-b9bc-a6ed31e53e46,MAC,2022-11-25,Key Reasons Why Macerich's (MAC) Shares Soared 65.8% QTD,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-reasons-why-macerichs-mac-120512286.html,1669377912,STORY,['MAC'],"[Shares of The Macerich Company MAC have skyrocketed 65.8% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s growth of 19.1%.Earlier this month, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT), headquartered in Santa Monica, CA, reported third-quarter 2022 FFO per share of 46 cents, excluding financing expenses in relation to Chandler Freehold. The figure grew 2.2% year over year.  It witnessed robust leasing demand during the third quarter, with tenant sales continuing to gain momentum. The portfolio occupancy improved year over year, and the re-leasing spreads were the strongest since the end of third-quarter 2019.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, Macerich’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor, has been experiencing solid leasing activity.These densely populated areas have an affluent customer base with significant disposable income. This has helped the company capture the post-pandemic rebound in retail demand, aiding its cash flow generation.During third-quarter 2022, Macerich signed 219 new and renewal leases encompassing 1.1 million square feet. Its portfolio occupancy improved year over year from 90.3% to 92.1% as of Sep 30, 2022.Moreover, the portfolio tenant sales per square foot for spaces less than 10,000 square feet in the trailing 12 months ended Sep 30, 2022, touched $877 — a record high.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained momentum and has become the focal point for many retailers. In line with this, Macerich has been focusing on enhancing its asset quality and customer relationships by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model. The company has also been shifting toward re-use and mixed-used properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants.Moreover, MAC’s development and redevelopment initiatives seem encouraging.In October 2022, Macerich announced plans for the next phase of the ongoing reinvestment in the company’s iconic Scottsdale Fashion Square, encompassing 1.9 million square feet. This will provide the company an opportunity to capitalize on the expenditure trend of affluent customers and generate decent cash flows.Further, this November, MAC announced that Dillard's DDS will construct a new and bigger store to replace its existing operations at South Plains Mall in Lubbock, TX.The new flagship store encompassing 220,000 square feet will take over the former Sears site, replacing the two locations Dillard's currently occupies at South Plains Mall. The construction for the same is slated to begin immediately, with an anticipated opening date in early 2024.Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.As of Nov 3, MAC had more than $615 million of liquidity. Its well-laddered debt maturity profile and ample financial flexibility have positioned it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Moreover, its projected current cash flow growth is significant compared with 26.69% growth estimated for the industry.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Macerich has remained committed to that. In October 2022, it increased the quarterly cash dividend payment from 15 cents per share to 17 cents, reflecting a hike of 13.3%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Also, amid the inflationary environment and interest rate hikes, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has presently stands at $1.80.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Assets Trust’s 2022 FFO per share is pegged at $2.29, presently.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While we are closely monitoring the potential impact of these dynamics, industry demand remains robust, driven by strong consumer balance sheets and pent-up demand after multiple years of constrained production. We also remain confident in GM's ability to navigate a complex operating environment, which the company has consistently demonstrated over the past few years. Finally, the long-term picture remains bright. We believe GM is significantly undervalued, is well-positioned for the long-term transition to electric vehicles and has numerous needle-moving ancillary business opportunities (most notably Cruise, which is an industry leader in autonomous vehicle technology) that are underappreciated. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Pet Food Companies in the World25 Most Polluted Countries in the World15 Biggest Fintech Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Shares have added about 18.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Universal Health Services due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Health Q3 Earnings Top on Better Patient VolumesUniversal Health Services reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. However, the bottom line fell 4.9% year over year.UHS’ quarterly results benefited from higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical personnel that continues to grapple most U.S. healthcare providers.Consequently, the margins of Universal Health took a hit as it had to incur elevated labor costs in the form of recruiting expensive temporary personnel or raising wages and benefits to attract and retain nurses and other clinical staff to counter the staffing scarcity.Quarterly Operational UpdateNet revenues of $3.3 billion improved 5.7% year over year in the third quarter. The top line outpaced the consensus mark by a whisker.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization (EBITDA), net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (NCI), declined 4.6% year over year to $427.8 million.Total operating costs of $3.1 billion increased 7.7% year over year, primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.Segmental UpdateAcute Care Hospital ServicesIn the third quarter, adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) rose 1.9% year over year on a same-facility basis, while adjusted patient days declined 5% year over year. Net revenues stemming from Universal Health’s acute care services inched up 0.9% year over year on a same-facility basis.Story continuesBehavioral Health Care ServicesAdjusted admissions improved 4% year over year on a same-facility basis in the quarter under review, while adjusted patient days grew 3.3% year over year. Net revenues derived from behavioral health care services of UHS advanced 8.4% year over year.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2022)Universal Health exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $74.6 million, which plunged 35.3% from the 2021-end level.Within its $1.2-billion revolving credit facility, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, UHS had $1 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity at the third-quarter end.Total assets increased 2.2% from the 2021-end level to $13.4 billion.Long-term debt of $4.6 billion escalated 12% from the figure at 2021 end.Total equity amounted to $5.9 billion, which dropped 4.7% from the level as of Dec 31, 2021.During the first nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of nearly $699 million improved 24.4% from the prior-year comparable period’s level. Significant growth came on the back of a favorable change from the early return of Medicare-accelerated payments received in 2020 and repaid in first-quarter 2021.Share Repurchase UpdateUniversal Health bought back around 1.6 million shares worth $157.9 million. UHS had $1.1 billion left under its total repurchase authorization as of Sep 30, 2022.2022 GuidanceEarlier, management anticipated net revenues to be $13.235-$13.371 billion for this year, the midpoint of which implies 5.2% growth from the 2021 figure.Adjusted EBITDA, net of NCI, was estimated within $1.635-$1.712 billion. The midpoint of the outlook indicates an 11.9% decline from the reported figure of 2021.UHS expected adjusted earnings per share for 2022 in the range of $9.60-$10.40, the mid-point of which suggests a 15.4% drop from the 2021 reported figure.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.19% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Universal Health Services has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Universal Health Services has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerUniversal Health Services belongs to the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry. Another stock from the same industry, HCA Healthcare (HCA), has gained 9.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.HCA reported revenues of $14.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2%.

181,16e2ff58-f39d-338c-8c96-5baa764cc1d3,AWK,2022-11-25,California Water's (CWT) Arm Buys Driftwood Valley Water Assets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-waters-cwt-arm-buys-171005348.html,1669309805,STORY,"['CWT', 'SJW', 'AWK', 'WTRG']","[California Water Service Group CWT recently announced that its subsidiary, Washington Water Service (Washington Water), has acquired Driftwood Valley Association’s water system assets. This acquisition will add 62 customers to the existing customer base of Washington Water. Washington Water also expects to provide service to new customers in the association as its 21 empty lots are developed.The company will continue to make investments in the local water infrastructure to increase resilience of the entire operation and provide high-quality services to current and future customers.Fragmented Industry Needs ConsolidationAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, at present, more than 51,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Due to a large number of small operators in the industry and lack of adequate funds, at times, essential upgrades and repairs of infrastructure get delayed.Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the losses of water utility operators. Aging and lack of timely maintenance are major contributors to pipeline breaks.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for infrastructural upgrade and the continuation of high-quality services for customers.Utilities Continue to ConsolidateCalifornia Water Service is expanding operations through strategic acquisitions. In October, 2022, CWT received approval to acquire the wastewater system assets of Keauhou Community Services, Inc. The buyout is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2023 and add 1,500 customers. In the same month, Washington Water received approval to acquire the assets of Stroh’s Water Company, which will add another 900 customers on closing by the first quarter of 2023.Other water utilities like American Water Works AWK, SJW Group SJW and Essential Utilities WTRG are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.American Water Works continues to focus on the acquisition of utilities that provide services to 5,000-50,000 customers. Through nine closed acquisitions in four states, it added 79,300 customers to its base. AWK’s pending acquisitions (as of Sep 30, 2022), when completed, will add another 21,600 customers to its base.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Water Works' 2022 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 4.9%. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.77%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.7% and 6.8%, respectively. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first quarter of 2022, the company completed one buyout, which added 11,000 customers. Essential Utilities plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Essential Utilities’ long-term (three to five years) earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.5%, respectively.

182,516e2353-1ed4-318b-a6e6-69a689239105,AWK,2022-11-25,Those who invested in American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) five years ago are up 82%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-american-water-works-134239250.html,1669297359,STORY,['AWK'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) share price is up 67% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, American Water Works Company achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of American Water Works Company's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, American Water Works Company's TSR for the last 5 years was 82%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that American Water Works Company returned a loss of 11% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American Water Works Company better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for American Water Works Company   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Ltd., Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co.

185,1d1d7770-0d73-373f-800b-66877daed015,LNT,2022-11-25,A Note On Alliant Energy Corporation's (NASDAQ:LNT) ROE and Debt To Equity,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/note-alliant-energy-corporations-nasdaq-133349323.html,1669296829,STORY,['LNT'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alliant Energy is:11% = US$667m ÷ US$6.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.Does Alliant Energy Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Alliant Energy has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (9.1%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Alliant Energy.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Alliant Energy's Debt And Its 11% Return On EquityAlliant Energy does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.37. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Alliant Energy may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Coke due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Coca-Cola Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesCoca-Cola has reported better-than-expected top and bottom-line results for third-quarter 2022. The company’s results have benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Driven by the strong results, the company has raised its growth expectations for organic revenues and comparable earnings per share for 2022.Comparable earnings of 69 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of 64 cents and rose 7% from the year-ago period. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt earnings by 11 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 18%.Revenues of $11,063 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,600 million and improved 10% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $10,557.8 million. Organic revenues rose 16% from the prior-year quarter. Coca-Cola’s top line benefited from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales.In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. The company benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Volume and PricingIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales advanced 4% year over year, while the price/mix rose 12%. The price/mix benefited from pricing actions in the marketplace across all operating segments, coupled with a favorable channel and package mix, owing to the lapping of last year’s pandemic-led disruptions. Price/mix also gained from a positive segment mix.Coca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 4% in the third quarter, backed by strength across all operating segments, ongoing investments in the marketplace and strength in the away-from-home channel. Growth was mainly led by improved trends in the developed markets, which recorded mid-single digits growth. Meanwhile, the developing and emerging markets rose in the low-single digits. Growth in developed markets was driven by Mexico, Western Europe and the United States. The developing and emerging markets benefited from growth in India, China and Brazil.Coming to the category cluster performance, volume benefited in the reported quarter from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Sparkling soft drinks’ unit case volume improved 3% year over year, driven by robust gains across all geographic operating segments, led by India, Mexico and China. Trademark Coca-Cola volumes were up 3% year over year on solid gains in all regions. The sparkling flavors category improved 3% on growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin America. The volume for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar rose 11% on double-digit growth across developed markets, and high-single-digit growth across developing and emerging markets.Volume for nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages was flat. The category primarily gained from fairlife in the United States, Minute Maid Pulpy in China and Maaza in India, offset by declines in local brands in Eastern Europe.The hydration, sports, coffee and tea category grew 5% in the third quarter. Coca-Cola witnessed 6% growth in hydration on improvements across the Asia Pacific and Latin America. Sports drinks rose 6% due to solid performances by Aquarius, BODYARMOR and Powerade. Tea volume was flat, as gains in Brazil and Mexico were offset by a decline due to the suspension of business in Russia. The coffee business witnessed 5% growth on the cycling impacts of the closure of Costa retail outlets in the U.K. in the prior year and the expansion of Costa coffee across markets.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues rose 4% for EMEA, 12% for Latin America, 21% for North America, 4% for the Asia Pacific and 7% for Bottling Investments, while the same declined 10% for Global Ventures.Organic revenues improved 20% in EMEA, 18% in Latin America, 14% in North America, 14% in the Asia Pacific, 5% in Global Ventures and 19% in Bottling Investments.MarginsIn dollar terms, the operating income increased 7% year over year to $3,088 million, including a 10-point impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating income rose 8.1% year over year. Comparable currency-neutral operating income advanced 18% on strong organic revenue growth across all segments, offset by higher operating costs and marketing investments.The operating margin of 27.9% in the third quarter contracted 100 basis points (bps) from 28.9% in the prior-year quarter. The comparable operating margin contracted 50 bps to 29.5%, driven by increased operating costs, higher marketing investments, the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds, which more than offset growth in the top line.GuidanceCoca-Cola, on Mar 8, 2022, suspended its business in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine. As a result, it expects a 1% impact on unit case volume, along with a 1% impact on revenues and operating income (earlier 1-2% impact). Adjusted earnings are likely to be affected by 3 cents.Management has also raised its organic revenue forecast for 2022. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 14-15% compared with 12-13% growth mentioned earlier.

187,d12c9cbd-54d1-337f-92d4-fb6a095ea2bb,PEP,2022-11-25,7 Sin Stocks That Can Weather a Recessionary Storm,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sin-stocks-weather-recessionary-190637876.html,1669057597,STORY,"['MCD', 'IIPR', 'PEP', 'SAM']","[With global recession fears rising, investors naturally find themselves scrambling for boring, dependable ideas but sin stocks may offer a potentially superior (and more exciting) alternative. To be fair, these ideas may challenge your sensibilities. Please do not mistake these companies as environmental, social and governance (ESG) trades.However, during hard times, few fundamental catalysts feature as much upside potential as cynicism. Whether tying into everyday addictions (such as caffeine or sugar) or aligning with more serious trends, sin stocks may be one of the few sectors that may survive the incoming malaise relatively intact. Yes, the notion stinks in many ways, and I understand this point well. However, when the smelly stuff hits the fan, you gotta do what you gotta do. On that bright note, below are seven sin stocks to buy.PEPPepsiCo$184.40MCDMcDonald’s$274.54PMPhilip Morris$97.11IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$111.45SAMBoston Beer$375.71BUDAnheuser-Busch$55.42RICKRCI Hospitality$86.88InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockOne of the most popular soft drink and snack manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) makes for an everyday solid bet. However, as one of the sin stocks that can weather a recessionary storm, few can match its relevance. Not surprisingly, PEP shares gained nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. While not a great figure by itself, the benchmark equity indices still remain in the red so far this year.Fundamentally, PepsiCo ranks among the sin stocks to buy because its underlying products tie in with everyday addictions. As the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center mentioned, “[i]n regular sodas, the sugar causes dopamine releases in the brain, stimulating pleasure centers. For some, it’s not the ingredients that cause the addiction, but the lifestyle habit that leads you to the fridge.”Stated differently, Pepsi enjoys a captive audience of sorts. And with economic woes brewing on the horizon, consumers might seek cheap pick-me-ups. Therefore, PEP makes for an intriguing case among sin stocks to buy.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockAs one of the most iconic American companies, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the world of western capitalism. With its ubiquity, MCD also makes for a solid purchase for investors seeking a balance between growth and reliability. However, as one of the sin stocks to buy, MCD truly shines.As with PepsiCo above, McDonald’s fundamental case as a vice trade centers on its core product. As Healthline.com mentioned, “[t]he fact is junk food stimulates the reward system in the brain in the same way as addictive drugs, such as cocaine.” Therefore, it’s no surprise that MCD represents one of the few publicly traded securities that are in positive territory for the year.Moving forward, McDonald’s can also benefit from the trade-down effect. Essentially, those that are enjoying nights out at fancy restaurants may start trading down to fast-food joints. Cynically, this dynamic should boost MCD, making it one of the sin stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comGenerally speaking, people regard soft drink and fast-food providers as “acceptable” sin stocks. In other words, an occasional indulgence in a sugary beverage to smooth down a juicy burger doesn’t arouse controversy. However, nobody speaks in those terms regarding tobacco players like Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). If anything, social forces attempt to stifle the industry.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking rates declined significantly over the years. On paper, that’s bad news for sin stocks related to the tobacco industry. However, should economic woes materialize, it’s very possible that smoking rates will increase from current lows.Admittedly, this talking point ties into unsavory concepts. However, the harsh reality is that economic downturns cause stress – sometimes deeply troubling stress. Under these conditions, adults make certain adult choices for relief. Cynically, this may lead to an uptick in demand for PM stock.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)a marijuana leaf displayed among other numbers related to stock performanceSource: ShutterstockOn the other end of the adult liberties segment stands what I’ll diplomatically term the “botanical” industry. In recent years, speculation toward the federal legalization of the underlying green material spiked certain equity units. Unfortunately, the narrative didn’t quite pan out. As well, macroeconomic pressures hurt the sector, including indirect players like Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR).Rather than grow the botanicals themselves, Innovative Industrial provides the services and resources for enterprises that do. On a moral level, then, you can mitigate the aura of sin stocks if you like. More importantly, IIPR appears to make plenty of sense given its relative discount. On a trailing-year basis, IIPR hemorrhaged over 59% of equity value.True, that’s not a great sign. Still, shares gained 20% in the trailing month, reflecting strong near-term momentum. As well, IIPR benefits from fundamental realities. Again, with stress levels likely to rise, folks may need a way to relax. Innovative Industrial helps those who help us – metaphorically speaking of course!Boston Beer (SAM)BeerSource: PixabayOne of the most popular breweries in the U.S., Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) catapulted to fame because of its Samuel Adams beer brand. Delightfully robust, Sam Adams won critical acclaim within the industry. According to a company press release, the brand won an unprecedented 125 international awards in its over three decades-long history.Fundamentally, Boston Beer obviously makes a case for sin stocks to consider because of its flagship product. It’s not a comfortable topic to discuss. However, scientific research demonstrates that the brain’s reaction to beer (I’d add good beer) makes it difficult to enjoy it judiciously. Essentially, we’re hardwired to drink more than one. Naturally, this cynically benefits SAM stock.The other factor of course focuses on the worsening economic environment. With major blue chips announcing or planning to implement huge layoffs, a rise in imbibing will likely materialize. To be clear, I’m not rooting for this dynamic. It’s just the reality of alcohol-related sin stocks at the moment.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)Source: ShutterstockOne of the classic sin stocks to buy, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is a stalwart in the brewery business. The company’s flagship product is Budweiser, which carries the unofficial title “The King of Beers.” Personally, I vigorously dispute this claim but that’s neither here nor there. Based on surveys and sales statistics, Bud and Bud Light routinely rank top among American consumers.As an investment in sin stocks, though, Anheuser-Busch may be quite a royal concept. Essentially, the company stands to benefit from the trade-down effect. Should economic pressures skyrocket, consumers are unlikely to go cold turkey in one swift transition. Instead, they’ll trade down their expensive beer for cheaper alternatives.Just as importantly, BUD sits on a relative discount. Since the beginning of the year, shares dipped over 12% in equity value. However, in the trailing month, they’re up nearly 22%. Investors may be recognizing the cynical opportunity, meaning you might want to act fast.RCI Hospitality (RICK)an empty stage at a night club with blue and purple lightsSource: shutterstock.com/IM_VISUALSPerhaps the most classic example of sin stocks to buy, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) represents an interesting idea. I don’t recommend necessarily looking up what the company does because it might lead to misunderstandings – it was for research, honest! Diplomatically, I’ll just say that RCI is a specialist in the fabric-free industry.If you didn’t quite get the euphemism, let’s put it this way. If you’re an ESG investor, RICK represents the antithesis of ESG. On the social side, controversies regarding exploitation exist. It’s not a family-friendly idea to be sure. What it is, though, is incredibly relevant on a cynical basis. According to precedent from the Great Recession, these establishments perform well amid economic downturns.Psychologically, such businesses may appeal to those who need some thrill in their lives after getting beaten down by corporate politics and pink slips. It’s not a savory idea among sin stocks but as history shows, it gets the job done.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have added about 5.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Beat at Canadian National in Q3Quarterly earnings of $1.63 per share (C$2.13) outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and improved 34.7% year over year. Quarterly revenues of $3,459.8 million (C$4,513 million) outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,214.2 million and increased 21.3% year over year. The uptick was driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues backed by higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports, higher volumes of U.S. grain and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.Freight revenues (C$4,366 million), which contributed 96.7% to the top line, increased 27% year over year. Freight revenues at the Petroleum and Chemicals; Metals and minerals; Forest products; Coal; Grain and fertilizers; Intermodal; and Automotive segments increased 19%, 31%, 29%, 53%, 22%, 26% and 52%, respectively.Carloads revenue ton-miles (RTMs) grew 5%. Segment-wise, carloads in Petroleum and chemicals; Forest products; Coal; Grain and fertilizers and Automotive grew 7%, 5%, 19%, 3% and 30%, respectively. The same at Metals and minerals; and Intermodal decreased by 1% each, respectively. Freight revenues per carload climbed 24% year over year in the reported quarter, while freight revenues per RTM improved 22%.Operating expenses (on a reported basis) ascended 15% to C$2,581 million. Adjusted operating income increased 31.3% year over year to C$1,932 million. The adjusted operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 57.2% in the third quarter of 2022 from 59% in the third quarter of 2021.Story continuesLiquidityCanadian National generated a free cash flow of C$1,356 million during the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s C$754 million.2022 OutlookCanadian National raised its full-year 2022 guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings to register roughly 25% growth (prior view: 15-20% growth) in 2022. The company now anticipates a free cash flow of nearly C$4.2 billion (prior view: C$3.7 billion-C$4.0 billion) in the current year.The operating ratio is still estimated to be below 60% for 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, CN has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, CN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCN belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry. Another stock from the same industry, Union Pacific (UNP), has gained 8.6% over the past month.

We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking.

Osterweis, Osterweis Capital Management serves the portfolio management needs of high net worth individuals, foundations and endowments. The firm provides investment management services through various products, including individually managed portfolios and mutual funds. After earning his B.A in Philosophy from Bowdoin College and his M.B.A from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Osterweis began his career as a senior analyst focused on forest products and the paper industry for several regional brokerage firms. He later joined E.F. Hutton &amp; Company.

Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $35.3 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: -13%The second largest railroad company in the United States, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), alongside its subsidiaries, operates over 8300 locomotives across 23 states. Founded in 1862, the company is based in Omaha, Nebraska.On October 22, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin raised the price target on Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) to $252 from $227 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares of the company.According to the 13F filings for the third quarter of 2021, Osterweis Capital Management holds 180,108 shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). These shares are valued at more than $35.3 million, representing 1.92% of the investment firm’s portfolio value.Chris Hohn of TCI Fund Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) as of the end of the third quarter, according to the data tracked by Insider Monkey. Overall, 63 funds were bullish on the company by the end of Q3, compared to 69 in the previous quarter.Vltava Fund, an investment management firm, published its first-quarter 2021 investor letter in which it mentioned Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). Here is what the fund had to say:“There was a slight change in Vltava Fund’s portfolio in the first quarter. We sold shares of Union Pacific. It was one of three stocks we bought a year ago at the market bottom. Although from a P/E viewpoint this was one of our most expensive purchases ever, the shares worked out quite well, and, when they were more than 90% higher at the beginning of this year, we decided to take profit and put the money into stocks with more attractive valuations.”9. PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $35.3 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: Blackstone Inc. Acquired PS Business Parks for $7.5 Billion in April 2022PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) is a California-based publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, develops, owns and operates commercial properties.John Osterweis' hedge fund reported holding 225,249 shares of PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) at the end of the third quarter, amounting to more than $35.3 million in worth and representing 1.92% of the fund's investment portfolio.Of the 867 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 12 were long PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) at the end of the third quarter, down from 16 in the preceding quarter. Israel Englander of Millennium Management is among the leading stakeholders of the company.On September 30, Wells Fargo analyst Blaine Heck upgraded PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $163, up from $155. The analyst argues that the company has successfully overcome many concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on small tenants and recent large move-outs, and valuation now appears fair, relative to peers.Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund, in its Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB), and shared their insights on the company. Here is what the fund said:“Filling a niche. The Real Estate sector continued to add to the strong run it has enjoyed since the COVID-19 lows of early 2020. At that time, we took a stake in PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB) based on our view that the market was being overly pessimistic about the long-term prospects for the real estate investment trust (REIT). Our actions were validated as the business has been a solid performer in the portfolio.PS Business Parks operates in the industrial, warehouse, and “flex” (combination of industrial &amp; office) real estate segment. Unlike competitors who often lease tens of thousands of square feet to single tenants, many of PS Business’ clients rent less than 5,000 square feet at a given location. The business also offers shorter leases— usually one to three years—than many of its peers.The company’s differentiated approach results in fewer competitors and less pricing pressure when seeking to attract tenants. Many investors initially saw the duration of PSB’s leases as a headwind for the business as the economy shut down and prospects for the commercial real estate market were dismal. However, rent collections and commercial activity have proven more resilient than feared, and PSB’s fundamentals appear to be heading in the right direction.Longer term, we continue to be impressed with PSB’s management team, which has demonstrated a knack for efficient use of capital all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Management’s focus on highly efficient capital deployment is evidenced by the company’s trailing 10-year free cash flow to invested capital yield of ~9% vs. an industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) peer median of 2%. The yield is impressive in our view, given the company has grown its inventory of square footage by a 10% compounded annualized growth rate over the past two decades.”8. Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN)Osterweis Capital Management's Stake Value: $37.18 million  Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 24: +3.4%Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN) is a Texas-based integrated waste services company that provides waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services, primarily of solid waste.

(NYSE:WCN) to $147 from $139, and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company reported ""strong"" Q3 results, highlighting its ability to execute amidst an uncertain and changing industry and macro backdrop.Based on the third quarter securities filings, Osterweis Capital Management holds 295,301 shares of Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), worth approximately $37.18 million, accounting for 2.03% of the fund's total portfolio value.

(NASDAQ:ODFL), with 897,068 shares worth approximately $256.5 million.Wedgewood Partners, in their Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL). Here is what the fund said:“We first bought shares of Old Dominion Freight Line in the third quarter 2018. Worried over the impact of the unfolding industrial downtown on the trucking industry, we sold the stock shortly thereafter during the second quarter of 2019. That was a mistake. We were correct to be worried about the trucking industry in 2019, but we were very wrong on how resilient Old Dominion’s business model would power through the industry downturn in 2019, as well as the Company’s exceptional performance during pandemic-laden 2020. Bucking the industry, the Company actually grew earnings per share by +3.8% and +11.4% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Licking our wounds, we are shareholders once again in this terrific Company.Old Dominion Freight Line has been a family run business for decades. Old Dominion was founded in 1934 in Richmond, Virginia by Earl and Lillian Congdon, running a single truck between Richmond and Norfolk. The founding year was fortuitous as the U.S. economy was in the early innings of its slow recovery from the Great Depression. The trucking industry boomed during the first half of the 1940s because of new congressional industry regulations and World War II armament spending…” (Click here to see the full text).6. Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“In our view, the payment network company, Visa, remains very well positioned to participate in an ever-expanding market for electronic payments. In time, ‘Buy now, Pay Later’ may have a modest impact on Visa’s transaction volumes, however in aggregate, we believe it will have the greater effect of supporting growth in electronic payments more broadly.

For any number of reasons, such value stocks may have fallen out of favor with investors and analysts. As such, the share price trades below what it should be worth based on the company’s fundamentals such as its earnings and book value. Most value stocks are older, more established companies where shares are trading at depressed or bargain prices. Value investors are people who take a long-term approach and buy a stock that is currently undervalued with the expectation that it will appreciate over time as the market eventually takes into account the company’s overall financial health as well as its future earnings potential.In fact, many of the most successful investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, identify themselves as value investors. They’re always on the hunt for stocks of good companies that are undervalued but should eventually recover and trade higher. Here are seven value stocks you can count on in this uncertain market.VVisa$212.34UPSUnited Parcel Service$183.65TXNTexas Instruments$179.14CETCentral Securities$34.96URIUnited Rentals$360.81UNPUnion Pacific$211.95AMTAmerican Tower$218.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks: Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit card giant Visa’s (NYSE:V) stock is down 6% this year and 12% below its 52-week high of $235. The median price target on the stock is currently $248 a share, which is 20% higher than its current level. This presents a rare opportunity for value investors with a long time horizon to buy shares in a great American company at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. Over the past five years, V stock had gained 85%.V stock had been as low as $178 a share in mid-Oct. before the company issued better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. The San Francisco-based company reported that it earned $1.93 a share on revenues of $7.79 billion in the July through September period. Wall Street had forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on revenues of $7.55 billion. Visa also announced in Oct. that it’s raising its quarterly dividend by 20%, providing even more value to shareholders.Story continuesValue Stocks: United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockWith the exception of, perhaps, the holidays, shipping parcels around the world isn’t a very exciting business. But as the world’s largest shipping and logistics company with annual revenues in 2021 of $85 billion, Atlanta, Georgia-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is the kind of value stock that investors can buy on the cheap with expectations that it will deliver long-term gains. UPS stock is down 16% on the year and trading at $180 a share. But over the last five years, the share price has grown 60%, and it is up 157% over the past decade.The median price target on UPS stock is currently $196, or nearly 10% higher than where the shares currently trade. For all of this year, UPS is forecasting revenue of about $102 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%. The company also intends to payout $5.20 billion in dividends to shareholders, giving it a strong yield of 3.37%. The company also plans to buy back at least $3 billion of its own stock. UPS stock currently trades at 14 times future earnings, which is below the average among stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making UPS shares look comparatively cheap.Value Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockDallas-based Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the kind of mature company that Wall Street has fallen out of love with and investors tend to ignore. However, discounting TXN stock would be a mistake. Today, Texas Instruments is a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. Unbeknownst to most people, the company is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world.TXN stock is down 10% this year and currently trading at $172 a share. However, over the last five years the shares have climbed 74% higher. Looking out 10 years, the stock has gained nearly 500%. If the share price appreciation isn’t enticing enough, consider also that Texas Instruments pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.76%. In addition, the stock looks quite undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more.Central Securities (CET)closed-end funds (CEFs)Source: ShutterstockCentral Securities (NYSEAMERICAN:CET) is a closed-end fund that offers great value to investors. In operation since 1929, Central Securities has been led since the 1970s by Wilmot Kidd III. While Kidd is also not a household name, he is regarded by many in professional investing circles as one of the greatest investors of all-time and the equal of Warren Buffett in terms of his returns.When Kidd took over Central Securities in 1974, the fund had $34 million in assets under management. Today that figure is $1.3 billion. While unknown to most, Central Securities has outperformed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A /BRK.B) over the past two decades. Central Securities has returned an annualized 14.5% with dividends reinvested to shareholders over the past 48 years, beating an 11.7% return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the same timeframe.Central Securities holds concentrated positions in a select number of stocks, some of which it has owned for 40 years. The company first bought Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock in 1986, and spent $700,000 to establish a position in private insurer Plymouth Rock back in 1982. The Plymouth Rock investment is worth more than $295 million today. Central Securities also has an extremely low expense ratio of less than 1% and has a history of paying outsized dividends. Down 23% this year, CET stock is a steal at its current price of $34 a share.United Rentals (URI)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockStamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world.  The company also boasts the biggest fleet of construction vehicles for rent on the planet. While URI stock has performed well, it gets scant attention from the media or public and continues to trade at levels that suggest it is undervalued. Year-to-date, United Rentals stock is up 6% and trading at $349 a share. That’s a significant outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500 that is down 18% in 2022. Over five years, the stock is up 128%.However, a price-earnings ratio of 12 is low and indicates that URI stock is trading at a discount right now. The median price target on the stock is $387.50, implying 11% upside from here. This is the type of stock that, while not cool, is necessary and manages to perform well in any market conditions.Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.Source: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.comUnion Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) is a major part of the U.S. rail infrastructure. Along with Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific forms a duopoly over long-haul freight rail service in the Western U.S., controlling much of the rail traffic west of the Mississippi River.This year, UNP stock is down 14% at $212 per share, and 24% below its 52-week high of $278.94. But over the last five years, the stock has climbed 80% higher, and it has gained nearly 250% since November 2012. Despite the success, Union Pacific’s stock trades at a modest 18 times forward earnings. Shareholders benefit from a dividend yield of 2.45%. Analysts seem to agree that there is more value to be extracted from Union Pacific. The 30 professional analysts who cover the company have a consensus “buy” rating on UNP stock.American Tower (AMT)Antenna Telephone and communication towers have a sunset background. American Tower (AMT) is one of the largest 4G tower operators in the U.S.Source: SERDTHONGCHAI / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). While most investors might yawn at the mere mention of a REIT, American Tower stands out as owner of the largest portfolio of wireless internet towers in the U.S. With its towers being adapted to handle fifth generation (5G) wireless, the company is rapidly expanding its infrastructure and network as demand soars for the most powerful internet possible.AMT stock is down 23% since January and changing hands at just under $220 a share. However, the shares have gained 50% over five years and grown 195% over the last decade. The P/E ratio is a little high at 34, but analysts seem to feel that the share price has room to run. The median price target on the stock is $240 a share, which would be about 10% above where it is currently trading. AMT stock also pays a solid quarterly dividend that yields 2.67%. The company’s earnings are forecast to rise steadily as demand for 5G internet continues to swell.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in V and CET.

The bottom line reflects a rise of 9% from the year-ago quarter. We had projected the same to be $5.99.Results were aided by growth in revenues and stable expenses. However, the tough operating backdrop hurt the assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) balance.After considering significant items, net income (GAAP basis) was $548 million or $4.86 per share, down substantially from $1.03 billion or $8.65 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses StableOn an operating basis, adjusted total net revenues (excluding unlocking) were $3.54 billion, up 1% year over year.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Ameriprise Financial (AMP). AMP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.61. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.54. Over the past 52 weeks, AMP's Forward P/E has been as high as 57.02 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.53.We also note that AMP holds a PEG ratio of 0.67. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AMP's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.87. Within the past year, AMP's PEG has been as high as 0.77 and as low as 0.58, with a median of 0.66.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. AMP has a P/S ratio of 2.45. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.49.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that AMP has a P/CF ratio of 13.50. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 25.49. Over the past year, AMP's P/CF has been as high as 15.34 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.91.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Ameriprise Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that AMP is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
