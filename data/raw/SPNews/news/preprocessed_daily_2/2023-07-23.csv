Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Texas Instruments, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$9.4b ÷ (US$29b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 36%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Texas Instruments here  for free.So How Is Texas Instruments' ROCE Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Texas Instruments. The company has employed 68% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 36%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Our Take On Texas Instruments' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Texas Instruments has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about Texas Instruments, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is potentially serious.Texas Instruments is not the only stock earning high returns.

3,361f6498-0ddd-3054-a31c-3f79406537ba,NUE,2023-07-23,Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 81% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nyse-nue-largely-120025368.html,1690113625,STORY,['NUE'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Nucor's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nucor. See our latest analysis for Nucor ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nucor?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nucor. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Nucor, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nucor. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. With 11% and 8.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NucorThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Nucor Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$251m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Nucor. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Nucor  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Unum Group's shares before the 27th of July in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 18th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.36 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.32 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Unum Group has a trailing yield of approximately 2.7% on its current stock price of $48.71. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Unum Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Unum Group is paying out just 18% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Unum Group's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Unum Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Unum Group? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Unum Group ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.So while Unum Group looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example - Unum Group has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

6,ffd91776-6cd1-3efa-a031-5478eb1e1510,WMT,2023-07-23,Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-nyse-wmt-paying-larger-120946193.html,1690114186,STORY,['WMT'],"[The board of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.57 on the 5th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 83.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Walmart has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 6.9% per annum. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Walmart is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Walmart that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE:MMC) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 20, 2023Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.2, expectations were $2.12.Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan’s Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings included in our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website.During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.John Q. Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses; Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan second quarter results were excellent. We performed well across our businesses and geographies extended the best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and generated double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Top line momentum continued with 11% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year.Story continuesAdjusted operating income grew 17% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.71 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While the U.S. and other major economies have been resilient, there remain significant uncertainty given persistent inflation, continued central bank tightening and geopolitical instability. However, we continue to perform well. As we have discussed in the past, there are factors that are supportive of our growth. We also have a track record of resilience and believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles.We manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in both good and challenging periods. We've made meaningful investments in market facing talent and improving sales operations and client engagement, which are contributing to our growth. And we continue to deliberately shift our business mix to faster growth areas. So, while the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile, we see opportunity to deliver greater value to clients through our leadership and capabilities in risk, strategy and people. A good example is Marsh McLennan's work to aid Ukraine's economy. Our four businesses together are mobilizing our unique expertise to support their future recovery and reconstruction efforts. In June, I attended the Ukrainian recovery conference hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.We have the honor of hosting a delegation of Ukrainian and British officials at our London offices where we announced proposals to help with Ukraine's recovery. Some estimates suggest over $1 trillion may be required for this effort. Yet investment capital will not be forthcoming until investors can protect themselves from war risk. To this end, we propose to Ukraine and the G7, the creation of a war risk insurance pool that would ensure commercial insurance is available for reconstruction projects. We also announced that we will partner with the Ukrainian government and insurers to create a data platform for the assessment of war risks. This project draws on Marsh McLennan's expertise and leverages data and information provided by the Ukrainians.By enabling effective and targeted risk modeling, it represents a critical first step for the industry to offer commercial insurance and unlock capital. Our colleagues at Oliver Wyman also partnered with the Ukrainian government to develop a post war transformation strategy. This would reposition Ukraine's economy in a way that leverages national strengths to move beyond resilience to opportunity. At Marsh McLennan, we consider it a privilege to support these endeavors. Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we appointed new leaders for Marsh McLennan International and U.S. and Canada as well as region and country leaders. These leaders are driving client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the individual value propositions of the businesses.We are bringing our collective capabilities where there is opportunity to provide greater value. This allows us to harness the benefits of our scale, data, insights and expertise to meet our client’s challenges and realize possibilities. This approach is already yielding benefits and improving the client and colleague experience. At the same time, we are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. The actions we are taking aim to realign our workforce and skill sets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduce our real estate footprint. As we said last quarter, we expect roughly $300 million of total savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to drive higher growth, enhance the colleague value proposition and be more efficient and connected.Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases continued with the Marsh Global Insurance market index up 3% overall versus 4% in the first quarter. Property rates increased 10% the same as last quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation was down low single-digits and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down high single digits. Cyber insurance pricing stabilized after several years of increases. In reinsurance, challenging market conditions persisted at mid-year renewals. Reinsurers were disciplined and rate increases remained significant, although the market showed more interest in deploying capacity than at January 1, given the firm pricing and improved terms.Global property cat reinsurance risk adjusted rates increased about 30% on average with loss impacted clients seeing higher pricing. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. On the casualty side, pricing pressure continued across most lines driven by prior year loss development and concerns about social and economic inflation. We continue to help clients manage these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.20 which is up 16% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 11%. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 8% in consulting. Marsh was up 10%, Guy Carpenter 11% versus 6% and Oliver Wyman grew 11%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year.For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 15% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $4.74 up 13% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for a strong year in 2023. In terms of revenue outlook, given our momentum, we expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be high single-digits. This reflects a continuation of current trends, but as we noted, the macro outlook remains uncertain and can turn out to be different than our assumptions. As for the bottom-line outlook, we continue to expect margin expansion for the full-year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Overall, I'm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our continued execution on strategic initiatives and momentum across our business despite an uncertain macro environment.I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they delivered to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.Pixabay/Public DomainMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning.

In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 9% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 9% in the second quarter of 2022. Latin America was up 17%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia Pacific grew 6%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 8% and international was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $576 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties.For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.6 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion up 4% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $388 million.

Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth in Mercer.Wealth grew 3% driven by continued strength in defined benefits. Investment management also delivered modest growth. Our assets under management were $393 billion at the end of the second quarter up 11% sequentially and 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven by a modest rebound in capital markets, positive net flows and our transaction with Westpac. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 6% on top of 17% growth in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see demand for rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation advice and solutions. With first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.7 billion with 7% underlying growth.Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $798 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying business and reflected continued strength in the Middle East and Europe and a rebound in the Americas. With first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.01 headwind in the third quarter and a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter. We reported $65 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $50 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment.We continue to expect total charges under this program to be $375 million to $400 million. To date, we’ve incurred approximately $300 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We still expect to achieve total savings of roughly $300 million by 2024, and now expect to realize approximately $200 million in 2023. Our other net benefit credit was $60 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the second quarter was $146 million up from $140 million in the second quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on short term borrowings, which we use for efficient working capital management.Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $142 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $567 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 24.2% compared with 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.6 billion.Our next scheduled debt maturity is October 2023, when $250 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&amp;A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% marking our 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. This increase, the largest in 25 years reflects our strong earnings growth over the past couple of years, confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Usage of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $295 million for dividends, $421 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases.The first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $591 million for dividends, $701 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. Given our strong results in the first half, we now expect high-single-digit underlying revenue growth for the full year. We continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. This guidance is based on our outlook today, but as John mentioned, there continues to be uncertainty in the environment looking forward. So outcomes could be different than our current assumptions. Overall, our excellent start leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2023. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to, John.John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Mark.

8,1c1a1a22-f7de-34cf-894b-77464cb0b74e,MMC,2023-07-23,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) Second-Quarter Results: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-companies-inc-nyse-120938703.html,1690027778,STORY,['MMC'],"[Investors in Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) had a good week, as its shares rose 2.5% to close at US$191 following the release of its quarterly results. It was a workmanlike result, with revenues of US$5.9b coming in 2.0% ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share of US$2.07, in line with analyst appraisals. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies earnings-and-revenue-growthAfter the latest results, the 16 analysts covering Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies are now predicting revenues of US$22.5b in 2023. If met, this would reflect a modest 4.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$7.34. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$22.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.35 in 2023. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$197, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies at US$213 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$145. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2023 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 8.2% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 8.2% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 5.5% per year. So it's pretty clear that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$197, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies analysts - going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.You should always think about risks though.

(NYSE:CRM) Trading At A 29% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-trading-140027157.html,1690034427,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Salesforce is US$320 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquitySalesforce's US$228 share price signals that it might be 29% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 32% higher than Salesforce's analyst price target of US$243How far off is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.47bUS$9.82bUS$11.8bUS$15.1bUS$18.1bUS$20.4bUS$22.2bUS$23.8bUS$25.2bUS$26.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x31Analyst x30Analyst x14Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 12.31%Est @ 9.25%Est @ 7.11%Est @ 5.61%Est @ 4.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$6.9kUS$8.4kUS$9.3kUS$11.0kUS$12.2kUS$12.7kUS$12.8kUS$12.7kUS$12.4kUS$12.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$110bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$26b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$442bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$442b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$201bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$312b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$228, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SalesforceStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Salesforce, there are three essential aspects you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Amid this earnings rush, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon and is expected to announce another 0.25% increase in its benchmark interest rate.The economic calendar will also keep investors busy with the first read on second quarter GDP, two looks at consumer confidence, inflation data, and an initial look at manufacturing activity in July all on the schedule.This headline blitz will follow a week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) take on a leadership role in the market, with the Blue Chip index rising 2.1% during the week and finishing a 10th straight winning session on Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) served as the week's laggard, falling 0.6%.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 split the difference, rising 0.7%.The Nasdaq was dragged down by results from Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) that prompted investors to pare their exposure to two of this year's tech highfliers. Whether this pattern continues to play out during earnings season will be one of this week's key storylines for investors.End of the Fed hikes?The US central bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday with Fed Chair Jay Powell set to hold a press conference a half hour later.Data from the CME Group on Friday showed markets pricing in a 99.8% chance the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate target range by another 0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%. This would bring the fed funds rate to its highest level since 2001.""After remaining on hold at its June FOMC meeting, we look for the Fed to raise the target range for the Federal funds rate by 25bp to 5.25-5.50%,"" Bank of America economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note on July 19. ""The cooling of the economy is only happening slowly, and we think most committee members believe further rebalancing of supply and demand is needed to ensure disinflation will continue.""Story continuesPowell's comments will be in focus for investors as the debate is sure to continue through the summer over whether an additional rate increase later this year will be necessary.""In the press conference, we look for Chair Powell to provide more clarity on what markers the Committee would need to see to be comfortable moving into an extended hold,"" Morgan Stanley's chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Thursday. ""For example ... Governor Waller expressed that if the next two readings on core inflation 'look like the last two, the data would suggest maybe stopping.' A similar message from Powell would suggest to us a lengthy hold is in store.""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on June 21, 2023.

On Wednesday, Meta and Chipotle (CMG) will highlight the schedule.Investors will also keep a close eye on results from Verizon (VZ) and AT&amp;T (T) — due out Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively — with these companies set to report for the first time since an early July report from The Wall Street Journal about lead-sheathed cables laid by telecom giants sent those stocks sharply lower.Big tech earnings should provide investors with a fresh update on the latest in artificial intelligence and the state of the cloud industry.As recently as last week, AI headlines were still pushing stocks higher. Apple (AAPL) shares popped nearly 1% after a report the tech giant may be building its own form of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock jumped after the company announced a $30-per-month AI-related integration that will be tied to Microsoft 365.Some analysts think that catalyst could be enough to counteract any slowdown in growth that might still be occurring with the company's cloud unit, Azure.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at Build, the company's annual conference for software developers Monday, May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Speaking with Yahoo Finance Live last week, Independent Solutions Wealth Management portfolio manager Paul Meeks said last quarter, companies had a simple message on AI-related initiatives: ""I'm doing it.""This quarter will be a different story.""Now what I need to see are some tangible benefits that are going to positively impact these companies' P&amp;L,"" Meeks said. ""What are they doing specifically? How are they going to monetize it? And when they monetize it, when do we start to see the goodies?""Because everybody can talk the marketing spin, but I need to see some tangible impacts on the P&amp;L. You better give it that to me. At least guide to it for the next couple of quarters, because I'm going to start to believe that it's all smoke.""The coming week will also provide more data on the health of the consumer, with results from McDonald's (MCD), Domino's (DPZ), and Chipotle being closely watched for signs of trade downs or pullbacks in spending.Last week, earnings from big banks and airlines largely showed a consumer that's still willing to spend, a bullish sign not just for these companies but the overall economy as the US continues to fight off a recession.Still, companies are reporting earnings declines.After reports from 18% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, 75% have reported earnings per share above estimates, below the five-year average of 78%, per FactSet. Meanwhile, 61% of companies have reported revenues above estimates, below the five-year average of 69% and the 10-year average of 63%.Entering the crucial earnings week, the stock market rally has notably broadened.After much was made about the 'Magnificent Seven' driving the S&amp;P 500 higher this year, Energy (XLE) and Health Care (XLV) closed out last week with four straight days of gains.""Profit cycle is what matters for Value/cyclicals vs. Growth,"" Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian wrote on Friday.

Never miss another market-moving alert.TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the EV maker's recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed revenues up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.Story continuesWells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""NetflixMeanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated revenue of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.Taiwan SemiconductorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2023 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product - Microsoft shares rocketed to a record high for the session.Analysts were generally bullish on the news as well.Barclays, for instance, called the move ""a major next step for MSFT’s AI monetization. We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""Mizuho was also very positive, writing:We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.Senad Karaahmetovic, Ambar Warrick, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.___Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

As part of the event, the companies agreed to voluntary safeguards to better manage the risks posed by AI.Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg attended the meeting. After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed.One of the big concerns about AI is how it could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation in a way that could impact an election. Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will ""tackle"" malicious or nefarious content ""regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine."" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that ""tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock.""When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that ""with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space."" ""I do think we are getting better. We have constant practice in doing this,"" Clegg adds.Click here to see the full interview with Nick Clegg.Key video moments:00:0:05 Meta's playbook for the elections00:01:46 How will users know that Meta has succeeded in mitigating misinformation?Video TranscriptSIENA SMITH: Nick, when it comes to misinformation on AI, there's been lots of talk about how this could potentially influence or what the run-up to the election could look like now that we have AI and the mass adoption of AI. When it comes to Meta's role in this and how you're approaching the 2024 election because now you also have threads, which has over 100 million users. What does your playbook look like this time around?Story continuesNICK CLEGG: I think the key thing I'd like to say about this is that the way we build our systems, not least, our AI systems which-- which, which make sure that bad content, and nefarious content, whether it's disinformation, whether it's foreign attempts to interfere in elections, whether it's hate speech and so on, those systems will tackle content regardless of where it's created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine.So whilst the volume may change, the fundamental architecture of our protections, which we've built up over the years, and not least because of the experience of what happened back in 2016 and because of the immense advances in AI, when we've spent $16 billion over the last few years on those kinds of defenses and protections. We have tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock.Those AI systems will tackle misinformation-- disinformation, where we can identify it regardless of its source. And that's, I think, important to remember. It's not as if-- as I say, the velocity and volume may change, but the fundamental power we have is because we are a platform that can control the distribution of that content, is as long as we can identify it, we can then restrict or even remove that content if we find it.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Nick, this all totally makes sense to me. But my question is how do we know it's going to work? Let's fast forward 18 months, let's say. The election is over. How do we know that Meta has succeeded in mitigating misinformation?NICK CLEGG: Well, look my crystal ball is no clearer than yours. All I can point to you-- So I can't tell you exactly what's going to happen in the future, and particularly not in something as unpredictable as elections. What I can reassure you about is that-- do you remember, we are a global platform? Over 95% of our users are outside the United States. And we have elections every single month in many different parts of the world.So it's not as if we only ever have to prepare ourselves for the US election. We have teams. We have highly sophisticated automated models, which are working to deal with elections nonstop, all year round, month in, month out. And with each election, we learn more because it's a very adversarial space.So I do think we're getting better. We have constant practice in doing this. We have made massive investments. I think world-beating and certainly industry-leading technology to deal with misinformation, disinformation, and so on. We give users as much information as we possibly can.And as I said earlier, it doesn't really matter from our point of view, whether the material-- if it's unwelcome and we want to block it or restrict it, it's produced by a machine or a human being, we will try and tackle it. But look, so I can only sort of tell you that I think we try our level best, and we do so on an ongoing basis. But exactly how that will play out, well, that's something that obviously we can speak about after the elections themselves.]"

To skip our detailed analysis on poverty and educational attainment in the U.S., you can head over directly to the 10 Poorest States in America.Nearly 38 million people live below the poverty line in the United States, making up for 11.6% of the population. Slices of wealthy groups exist alongside pockets of poverty-stricken populations, reflecting the glaring inequality across the country. Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics are the most affected communities.In terms of poverty, Mississippi is the poorest state in America with a poverty rate of 18.1% in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau – followed by Louisiana at second, and New Mexico at third. On the other hand, New Hampshire has only 5.6% of its population living below the poverty line. It tops the charts of states with the lowest poverty rates in America. You can read more about states with low poverty rates in the U.S. in our article, 25 States with the Lowest Poverty Rates in America.The disparity in economic prosperity between states could be attributed to a number of factors, including geographic locations, economic policies of the local governments, and access to resources. In our analysis, we have also observed a relationship between poverty and education levels in states. Most of the states (21) that are part of the 25 least educated states are also present in the list of the 25 poorest states ranked by poverty rates.In terms of education, West Virginia is the least educated state in the US. Only 36% of the population aged between 18 and 24 has a college or associate degree, while a mere 14.2% of the population aged 25 and above holds a bachelor's or undergraduate degree. New Mexico and Nevada are second and third, respectively.A number of corporations have begun playing an active role to promote economic activity in states affected by poverty. After success in Northeast Wisconsin where 88% of schools now offer education in Computer Sciences, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in 2022, expanded its TechSpark program to Jackson in Mississippi. The program aims to provide digital skills and access to communities that are at the risk of being left behind in the growing digital economy in the United States. As part of the initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched a Cybersecurity Readiness Program at Jackson State University to train 100 students and provide them with practical cybersecurity experience. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s partnership with the state of Mississippi also includes the CoBuilder Accelerator Program, which brings together founders of 21 home-grown startups to train them and raise funding for their ventures.Story continuesIn the financial markets sector, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) has entered into a $15 million collaboration with a nonprofit organization called ideas42, to accelerate economic activity in low and middle income regions. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the leading financial services companies in the United States, serving over 10% of all small businesses, and one in three households nationwide. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), in 2021, announced to invest up to $2 billion towards affordable housing in three cities where it had major operations. This included Nashville, the capital of Tennessee state. According to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the initiative was aimed at helping families achieve long term stability and building strong communities.Tennessee is one of the states in the United States that is affected most by poverty. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s impact in the state has been significant in countering the economic challenges facing the people. The company has invested more than $13 billion in infrastructure and compensation to its employees in the state over the past decade. More than 20,000 jobs have been created in Tennessee as of 2020 by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has a minimum wage of $15 per hour.MethodologyWe have ranked the poorest states in the US using two metrics: poverty rates and education levels in each state. Data for both were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 reports. Poverty rates for each state were determined. Education levels were further broken down into two areas. The first being the population aged between 18 and 24 that has a college or associate's degree, followed by population aged 25 and above that holds a bachelor's degree. Equal weightage was assigned to poverty and education levels, then summed to get an aggregate score. In the case where scores were equal for two or more states, poverty rates were used as a tiebreaker to outrank one over the other.25 Poorest States in AmericaHere are the poorest states in the US:25.

Over to you, Emmanuel.Feel Photo Art/Shutterstock.comStory continuesEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations to reach a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60. This was driven by impressive ZYN and IQOS growth, coupled with strong combustible results. We delivered total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth of 3.3%, putting us well on track for our third consecutive year of positive volumes. This excellent result underpinned double-digit organic topline growth and high-teens currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We also expanded our leadership in smoke-free products in the period. Firstly, IQOS’ strong momentum continued, with adjusted in-market sales volumes, led by plus 16%, and shipments up by plus 27%.This reflects very good user growth of plus 1.4 million in the quarter and continued strong traction across the world. This is increasingly driven by IQOS ILUMA, which is now available in 23 markets, representing around two thirds of our IQOS business by volume. Secondly, and now two full quarters after the Swedish Match acquisition, ZYN is delivering an exceptional acceleration to our smoke-free business. US volumes grew by over plus 50%, including a notable step-up in June. We are delighted with this performance. Our combustible business also delivered better-than-expected results with over plus 7% organic net revenue growth after a very robust quarter for pricing and resilient volumes. This was a key contributor to the strong plus 7% organic operating income growth, with a plus 210 basis points sequential improvement in our adjusted operating income margin.Turning to the headline numbers, positive volumes supported very strong organic topline growth of plus 10.5%, with continued excellent IQOS momentum and a further acceleration in combustible pricing. This does not include the remarkable plus 19% pro forma ex-currency topline growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN, with combined pro forma ex-currency net revenues increasing by plus 11.1%. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by plus 19%. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7.0%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and combustible pricing. Due to these positive factors, adjusted operating income grew by a very robust plus 7% organically despite continued inflationary headwinds. This excludes the tremendous growth of ZYN, and starting in Q4, our organic results will include Swedish Match.Adjusted OI margins improved 210 basis points sequentially, and while still organically lower year-on-year by 140 basis points, this better-than-expected performance was notably supported by combustible strength and favorable timing of certain costs. We also increased our participation in the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia, which now represents close to 40% of its industry volumes, and is slightly dilutive to our margins. This organic delivery, including the favorable timing of costs, combined with exceptional June ZYN volumes, and a lower tax rate, allowed us to outperform our most recent Q2 forecast. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, representing 16.9% growth, excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.13, notably due to the Japanese yen.While the first quarter of the year contained some exceptional headwinds and distortions due to timing and comparison effects, our business delivered a strong first half, including volume growth of 1.1%. Organic net revenues grew by 6.8%, with Swedish Match’s excellent ex-currency pro forma net revenue growth of 17% for H1, demonstrating its growth accretion to our business. Combined pro forma currency-neutral net revenues increased by around 7.5%. Following peak margin headwinds and a notable operating income decline in the first quarter, the strong improvement in Q2 narrowed the H1 organic decline to minus 2%. As in Q2, this excludes Swedish Match, which delivered an excellent profit performance and made a significant contribution to our adjusted OI margins.We expect continued strong reported and organic operating income growth in the second half. Despite these headwinds, we delivered 5.9% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to $2.98 in H1, providing a strong platform for the second half of 2023 and beyond. Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q2 net revenues. While not included in our reported shipment volume growth of 3.3%, Swedish Match’s smoke-free volumes grew by 15%, providing impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth. This primarily reflects combustible strength, partly benefitting from timing effects. As in Q1, HTU pricing was impacted in Japan and Germany by the annualization of 2022 excise tax increases, and in the case of Japan, the transition to ILUMA.These factors will have less impact in the second half as annualization recedes. We also continue to expect greater visibility on the likely outcome of the court ruling related to the German tax surcharge toward the end of the year. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business again contributed positively, reflecting higher net revenue per unit, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing, are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. Let’s now turn to gross margins. While the year-on-year trajectory remained negative, we saw improvement versus the first quarter, driven by strong growth fundamentals. Indeed, we achieved sequential improvement of 1.2 percentage points despite increased inflationary pressures, as topline growth accelerated and supply chain disruptions and ILUMA-related factors started to dissipate in the quarter.In addition, cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, increasingly normalized after an adversely affected Q1. Our IQOS business contributed positively to our gross margin in Q2, and we expect this to continue, partly mitigating combustibles. We expect further improvement in our year-on-year gross margin trajectory in H2 as headwinds continue to subside, ZYN’s outstanding growth continues, and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. As expected, SG&amp;A growth was much closer to net revenue growth in Q2, and at a more normalized growth rate with regard to our full year expectations. Indeed, with such a strong topline in Q2, SG&amp;A costs were lower as a percentage of net revenues. While we continue to invest in IQOS and ZYN, our successful cost efficiency programs continue to deliver, helping to finance growth investments and mitigate inflation, which remains a headwind.With $1.9 billion of gross savings realized to date, including $820 million from SG&amp;A, we are on track to achieve our 2021-23 $2 billion target ahead of plan. Turning now to the 2023 outlook, we are raising our currency-neutral top and bottom-line growth forecasts. We aim to be a growth company starting with volumes. In 2023, we expect to grow total volumes for the third year in a row, even before factoring in the excellent progress of Swedish Match’s portfolio. As part of this growth, we are reiterating our targeted HTU shipment range of $125 billion to $132 billion, while we expect a cigarette volume decline of 1.5% to 2.5%. We are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting the continued momentum of IQOS, the resilience of our combustible business, and the ongoing excellent growth of ZYN, which we expect to contribute positively in Q4.We expect strong organic operating income growth in the remainder of the year to support H2 margin expansion despite the headwinds previously mentioned and certain technical impacts. These relate to the increased use of third-party manufacturing in a few markets, such as Indonesia and Ukraine, and the related growth of the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia I already mentioned. The full year estimated impact of these factors is around 40 basis points on our adjusted OI margin, and without this impact, we would expect to be broadly in the middle of our forecast organic margin range. On top of this organic evolution, we expect Swedish Match to add around 50 basis points of accretion. Our strong topline and OI outlook allows us to raise our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to 8% to 9.5%.This translates to a revised range of $6.13 to $6.22, including $0.33 from unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, notably due to the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This forecast continues to assume around $150 million for incremental investments in the US, and our Wellness and Healthcare business. It also assumes around $1.2 billion in net finance costs, which includes higher interest on variable debt, partly offset by better returns on cash deposits. As previously mentioned, our forecasts do not assume any contribution from a potential favorable ruling on the Germany tax surcharge. Focusing on the second half in more detail, we expect strong performance on all key metrics as smoke-free products deliver an increasingly positive impact.In Q3, we forecast high single-digit organic topline growth, with HTU shipments of 31 billion to 33 billion units, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, including $0.06 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect notably strong reported and organic OI growth as certain inflationary impacts are annualized, and we increasingly benefit from an optimized ILUMA supply chain and consumables. As I mentioned, Swedish Match will also be included in our organic figures during the quarter. The exceptional growth of ZYN is clearly margin-accretive, as visible in our adjusted H1 figures. Turning back to our results, our total shipment volumes increased by 3.3% for Q2, and 1.1% year-to-date. HTU shipment volumes grew by 26.6% in Q2 to reach 31.4 billion units, notably driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan.In addition to fundamental strength, HTU shipments to Japan were boosted in Q2 by around 2 billion units as we increased sea freight, with corresponding increases in inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, total PMI adjusted in-market sales volumes of HTUs increased by 16% in Q2, continuing the excellent trend seen in Q1. H1 shipment volumes grew by 18.5%. Notably, this does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 14% in Q2 and 12% in H1 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.4% in Q2, with notable support from Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.7% for H1, reflecting a solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite stepped-up pricing. Our smoke-free transformation continues to progress rapidly.Due to the continued impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 16.4% of our total shipment volume in H1 as compared to 14% in the first half of 2022, despite a resilient cigarette category. Including oral smoke-free products, this would be close to 18%. Powered by IQOS and ZYN, smoke-free products made up 35% of our adjusted net revenues in H1, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2022. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 4.5% of our H1 inhalable smoke-free net revenues. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of 7.4% in Q2 and 5.2% in H1. This reflects strong Q2 pricing, with a notable contribution from Indonesia and the Philippines. While we don’t expect the exceptionally strong Q2 pricing of 9.4%, which benefitted from timing factors, to be fully replicated in H2, we now forecast a full-year increase of 7% to 8%.Our cigarette category share grew by 0.7 points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, including contributions from Duty Free, Egypt, and Turkey, and by 0.1 point in H1, resulting in only modest volume declines. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last 18 months, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. The combination of our stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of our leading smoke-free brands, positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 1.1 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q2, and 0.5 points in H1, with notable contributions from Turkey and Japan. Impressively, despite increasing competition in many markets, our volume share of the growing heat-not-burn category remains stable at around 75%.This is supported by ongoing ILUMA market launches and increasing focus on our two-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q2 of 0.2 points to a record 9.2% share. We estimate there were 27.2 million IQOS users as of June 30th. This reflects excellent growth of 1.4 million adult users in Q2, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. While fundamentals remain very strong, I remind you that Q3 user growth can often be below the average for the year due to the seasonal factors evident in prior years.I will now turn to IQOS in the Europe Region, where we are approaching a milestone of 12 million users. This reflects the further roll-out of ILUMA, which is now available to around 70% of IQOS users in the region, and the expansion of our two-tier portfolio. As an illustration of its progress, TEREA is already close to 100% of our HTU in-market sales volumes in the first launch markets of Spain and Switzerland. Our second quarter HTU share increased by 1.6 points year-over-year to 9.0% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted in-market sales volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and reached a record high on a four-quarter moving average.This reflects strong year-on-year growth of 20% in Q2, outstripping the 11% growth in HTU shipments, which were affected by some residual effects from the inventory dynamics seen in Q1. We expect robust growth in HTU shipments, adjusted in-market sales, and overall region organic net revenues in the second half. We continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of European countries adopting multi-year excise tax plans, with clear differentiation of smoke-free products. Over half of EU member states have now passed multi-year plans. Also in the EU, a number of member states are currently transposing the Delegated Directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the flavor ban into national legislations. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on October 23rd, and we will be adjusting our HTU portfolio as required, in line with this transposition.While short-term volatility is possible, we do not expect a significant change in the structural growth of the category. To give some further color on our continued progress in the region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Despite the denominator effects of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. We are very pleased with trends in Rome, showing a sequential step-up to 28% share following the ILUMA launch. Robust progress in London and Munich also bodes well for these two key markets. While the Q2 2022 comparison for share in Vilnius was helped by the popularity of certain bundle offers, the share of over 40% remains impressive, and underlying offtake continues to grow.In Japan, IQOS ILUMA continues to drive impressive growth momentum. Smoke-free products made up over 75% of our Japan net revenues in H1, clearly showing the path for the broader company. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points in Q2 to 26.3%, further strengthening TEREA and SENTIA’s positions as the clear number one and two heat-not-burn brands, despite intensified price competition for mid and low-price offerings. Importantly, adjusted in-market sales volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, as IQOS outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q2 shipments to Japan also benefitted from progressively switching back to sea freight during the quarter.In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q2 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Notable ongoing successes include Egypt, with Cairo offtake share surpassing 8.5%, and Bulgaria, with offtake share in Sofia exceeding 15%, despite the usual impact of seasonality that I mentioned. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets. Now moving to Swedish Match, which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory. As covered earlier, the business delivered outstanding currency-neutral net revenue growth of 19% in Q2 and 17% in H1.This means that in the first half of the year, Swedish Match has added 70 basis points of currency-neutral growth to our pro forma topline, and 60 basis points to our adjusted OI margin. In the US, ZYN delivered another exceptional quarter, with volume growth of over 50%, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gains in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia, broadly continued. The cigar business performed well, with Q2 organic net revenue growth of 16%. This reflects ongoing share gains despite being an early mover on category pricing. I would like to again congratulate and thank all the Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver terrific results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities, which is progressing very well.Looking at ZYN’s US performance in more detail, exceptional year-over-year volume growth in cans of 53%, also reflects a 22% sequential increase versus Q1, 2023. This accelerated growth reflects progressive increases in distribution and a broad nationwide step-up in store velocities as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. This includes California, which implemented a statewide flavor ban in December. While such elevated rates of growth may not continue indefinitely, the structural indicators remain very encouraging. Impressively, ZYN category volume share grew 2.2 points compared to prior year and 1 point sequentially, despite continued discounting from less premium offerings.Retail value share also grew to 76.8%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity. Now, let me provide an update on our innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. First and foremost, the global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA continues to be a top priority. We launched ILUMA in six markets in Q2, and with HTU manufacturing constraints now normalized, we aim to be present in around 50 markets by the end of the year. The most significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth is in the US We are investing behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 next year. As mentioned in today’s release, we are also on track for IQOS ILUMA PMTA and supplemental MRTPA submissions in Q4 2023.Our philosophy on the US remains unchanged. We will seek to accelerate our topline with IQOS and ZYN, supported by disciplined investment and leveraging both our extensive experience in smoke-free products and Swedish Match’s infrastructure and knowledge, while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI. Our pilot city launches for BONDS in the Philippines and Colombia continue to progress well. The learnings from these markets will be integrated as we roll out more broadly, starting next year. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key medium-term opportunity, notably for ZYN as the world’s leading brand. We are now preparing for the launch of - re-launch of ZYN in several markets. In e-vapor, our refocused approach in select markets is progressing with VEEV ONE, our newly designed pod-based system introduced in four markets, and VEEV NOW, our disposable product, in six markets.Now let me discuss our Wellness and Healthcare segment, starting with its first clinical trial results for our inhalable aspirin product. While it was observed that the experimental product had a rapid onset of effect, which is the key medical advantage sought, there was significant variability in inhaled dose among subjects. The study was therefore deemed unsuccessful, and as a result, product design improvements are required. Our plan was to file this product with the FDA later this year. However, additional time is now required, and the outcome is therefore less certain. In addition, the CDMO business has been facing slower-than-anticipated development, including cost-related challenges. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment from our annual assessment, as detailed in today’s release.While these elements will postpone the achievement of our 2025 aspiration to reach over $1 billion of net revenues from Wellness and Healthcare products, they will result in a corresponding decrease in the level of investment in 2024. Our ambitions to build and monetize our product pipeline are unchanged. As in the early days of developing IQOS, certain headwinds are to be expected, and the 2021 acquisitions in this segment have provided us with unique and enabling R&amp;D capabilities. We remain committed to developing our Wellness &amp; Healthcare business and continue to see attractive mid and long-term growth potential on many fronts such as inhalable drugs, NRT, and consumer wellness products, including non-recreational cannabinoids, in line with applicable regulatory requirements.We also aim to accelerate Vectura’s growth, and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its CDMO business. We plan to discuss all these topics, including our plans for IQOS in the US and a full update on our Wellness &amp; Healthcare business at our Investor Day on the 28th of September in Lausanne, Switzerland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible products by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy, driving accelerated growth and returns over time from a more sustainable business. In addition, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class progress in other key sustainability areas.With our extensive agricultural and manufacturing supply chain, human rights are a very important responsibility for our company. We released our first dedicated report on the topic last month, detailing our strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights, and the progress to date in implementing our human rights commitment. Our performance on human rights is included in the 19 KPIs of our Sustainability Index, which comprises 30% of executive long-term equity compensation, weighted towards our product transformation. Our goal is to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest risk markets by the end of 2025. These help us better understand and address our impacts, and we are making excellent progress, with seven completed to date.Addressing climate change is another priority for us, and I’m pleased to share that PMI was included in Forbes' first ever Net Zero Leaders List, ranking seventh overall for all US public companies, higher than any other consumer products or services company. To conclude today’s presentation, we delivered a very strong first-half despite a number of headwinds, putting us on track for the third consecutive year of positive volumes and organic net revenue growth of over 7%. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business gives us confidence in a strong full year performance, with excellent operating income growth. Outstanding momentum continues for IQOS and ZYN, the world-leading heat-not-burn and oral nicotine brands, and we have exciting plans to further grow oral nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year.Importantly, we remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders, including through our progressive dividend policy. In short, our smoke-free transformation continues to deliver sustainable growth. We look forward to sharing more with you on the next phase of our transformation at our Investor Day on September 28. Thank you very much, and we are now delighted to answer your questions.See also 25 Smallest Countries In the World That Matter the Most and 25 High Paying Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This means the annual payment is 7.7% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Western Union's dividend was only 47% of earnings, however it was paying out 124% of free cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.EPS is set to fall by 12.8% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 57%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.40 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.94. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.9% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Western Union has been growing its earnings per share at 22% a year over the past five years. Western Union is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.In SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Western Union's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Western Union (of which 2 are significant!) you should know about.

24,7faff37d-f519-3ef0-bd55-8291889cb600,TDG,2023-07-23,Investing in TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) five years ago would have delivered you a 176% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-transdigm-group-nyse-tdg-110038698.html,1690110038,STORY,['TDG'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) stock is up an impressive 140% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 16% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 10% in 90 days).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, TransDigm Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 50.91.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think TransDigm Group will grow revenue in the future.A Dividend LostThe share price return figures discussed above don't include the value of dividends paid previously, but the total shareholder return (TSR) does. In some ways, TSR is a better measure of how well an investment has performed. Over the last 5 years, TransDigm Group generated a TSR of 176%, which is, of course, better than the share price return. Although the company had to cut dividends, it has paid cash to shareholders in the past.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that TransDigm Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 57% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 23% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TransDigm Group better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with TransDigm Group .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

What are you wearing to the #barbiemovie premiere?”Once the firm saw the excitement around the Barbie movie, it wanted to jump on the opportunity, owner Wilglory Tanjong said. The firm's post, which features Tanjong using a voiceover from the Barbie movie, is one of the brand's most-viewed and most liked videos on TikTok.Stoutridge, a New York-based vineyard and distillery with a weekly email newsletter, blasted out a “spur of the moment” Barbie-inspired hot pink cocktail recipe on Wednesday after only taking an hour to create the drink, said owner Kimberly Wagner. The cocktail, known as ""The Barbie,"" is a mixture of Blue Curacao, grenadine syrup and club soda.Story continuesMoonFire, an arts boutique based in Dallas, Texas, hosted a Barbie-themed collaboration in person with ten small businesses selling hot-pink, Barbie-inspired products. The shops offered free cocktails, flash tattoos and a life-sized Barbie box. Its TikTok video for the event drew more than 100,000 views. Swag Pup Co, a pet retailer, promoted its Barbie and Ken-themed bandanas for dogs on social media. Owner Mica Garbarino said a ""vintage"" black-and-white pup outfit sold out within the first few days--faster than her typical pup apparel.To be sure, even bigger brands without official Barbie licenses are taking advantage of the pink-themed trend. Swarovski’s Soho location in New York City is now decorated with bubble gum pink walls behind its neon pink swan logo. A search for “Barbie” on the company’s website returns rose-gold jewelry and pink gemmed rings.J. Walker Smith, a consultant at research firm Kantar, said that no matter the size of company, it is important to be on-trend and getting behind the Barbie momentum “is a very good idea.”“Small businesses are never in a position to create big mega-trends – very large businesses can do that. So, for small businesses, the strategy is to be a quick follower,” he said.Smith said small brands taking advantage of the Barbie marketing momentum will scoop up more “than just young people” and will grab the “prime marketing target” of women who are in their 30s and 40s.These women “directly control a disproportionate amount of spending” and they indirectly serve as influencers and gatekeepers to children and teens, according to Smith.(Reporting by Kailyn Rhone and Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Josie Kao and Nick Zieminski)]"

28,5d625b29-8803-38b0-b08c-2cef687ad124,MAT,2023-07-23,How Mattel’s CEO dove into a culturally-challenged company losing hundreds of millions a year and emerged with a Barbie box office phenomenon,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mattel-ceo-dove-culturally-challenged-120000860.html,1690027200.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[This weekend thousands of fans will swarm their local movie theaters to see Barbie’s big-screen debut.Opening weekend ticket sales for Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are expected to bring in as much as $150 million opening weekend. That would put it on par with Spider-Man 3, which had the 26th-highest weekend box office debut. Gerwig is also likely to secure the record for the largest opening weekend for a female director (Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman currently holds that title, earning $103.2 million on opening weekend).But Barbie’s journey from the toy aisle to the big screen wasn’t a sure thing. It involved a massive turnaround at Mattel, the company behind the iconic blonde doll. In just five years, 57-year-old CEO Ynon Kreiz, who became CEO in April 2018, has transformed the company by cutting down on costs and using its intellectual property (IP) heft to open a whole new revenue stream.“I took our portfolio of iconic franchises in children and family entertainment to be an incredible opportunity to extend the company outside of the toy aisle,” Kreiz told Fortune’s Alan Murray and Michal Lev-Ram last week on the Leadership Next podcast.Kreiz, a former entertainment executive, joined Mattel at a low point in 2018. Net sales for fiscal year 2017 were $4.88 billion, down 11% from the year before, with an operating loss of more than $342 million. The company was steeped in debt. Cultural issues and bureaucracy also plagued Mattel. Siloed business functions, a drab corporate office, and an archaic toy design center were stifling the company, according to Fortune reporting at the time. A total of four CEOs were appointed between 2012 and 2018, and Kreiz’s predecessor, Google alum Margo Georgiadis, resigned just a little over a year into the job.Kreiz insists that Mattel’s stuffy, bureaucratic culture of years past is now long gone. “It’s a different company,” he said.After taking charge in April 2018, Kreiz cut Mattel’s strategy document from a three-inch thick binder to a single page. The company shuttered its New York office in April 2018 and laid off 2,200 workers a few months later as part of a savings program aimed at cutting costs by $650 million by late 2019. In the first three years under Kreiz’s leadership, Mattel achieved cost savings that exceeded a billion dollars in total, and has since cut costs by another $200 million, Kreiz said.Story continuesAnother key win was gaining back Disney’s coveted Disney Princess and Frozen doll franchises, which the toy maker lost to competitor Hasbro in 2014. Kreiz already had an established relationship with the media conglomerate, and it previously purchased two companies he helmed: Maker Studios in 2014 and Fox Kids Europe in 2001.“Needless to say, trust played a key role here,” he said of regaining the Disney Princess and Frozen doll licenses. “And Mattel has evolved over those years to become an incredible, incredible platform, both in terms of design and development, with a very strong supply chain that is, we call now, a competitive advantage, and a very large scale commercial platform.”In addition to running Fox Kids Europe and Maker Studios, Kreiz’s other entertainment industry bona fides include running Endemol, a struggling Dutch-based producer of reality TV including Big Brother, from 2008 to 2011. He restructured the company by bulking up its senior team, moving its commercial operations to London, and expanding its content offerings to sports and scripted TV.At Mattel, Kreiz launched a movie division, Mattel Films, in 2018. He hired Robbie Brenner, a veteran producer who earned an Oscar Best Picture nomination for producing Dallas Buyers Club that same year. Brenner revived Barbie from “development hell”—industry jargon for when a project gets stuck in early development—after it moved around for years from one movie studio to another. Warner Bros. signed on to produce the movie in Jan. 2019, with Australian actress Margot Robbie set to star. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were recruited to co-write the movie in July 2019, and Gerwig signed on to direct the film in 2021.Mattel has announced it will produce 13 more films based on its toy brands, including a J.J. Abrams-directed Hot Wheels movie, a Lena Dunham-directed Polly Pocket feature, and a heist movie based on the board game Uno starring rapper Lil Yachty. There are a total of 45 film projects in development, according to a New Yorker profile published in July.Kreiz is clear-eyed about the company’s IP strengths, calling franchises like Barbie its “currency.”“Having a healthy toy business allows us to develop and strengthen this emotional relationship we have with our fans,” Kreiz said. “These are fans, this is an audience. And once you realize that and it becomes part of your DNA, it opens up a world of opportunities.”But he adds that the company is an active participant in movie making. “As the IP owner, we’re not handing over the franchises and walk[ing] off the field…We are actually in the game. We are on the field. We play a key role on the creative side, on the production side, on how these projects evolve.”While Barbie’s release this weekend marks a victory in Mattel’s turnaround story, Kreiz seems poised for whatever challenge the company will tackle next.“The work at Mattel is very fulfilling and always fun,” Kreiz said. “Yes, it’s challenging and it never ends, but it’s not a job where…I need to come home and unwind. I relish the challenge and the excitement that this company creates.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Never miss another market-moving alert.TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the EV maker's recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed revenues up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.Story continuesWells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""NetflixMeanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated revenue of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.Taiwan SemiconductorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2023 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product - Microsoft shares rocketed to a record high for the session.Analysts were generally bullish on the news as well.Barclays, for instance, called the move ""a major next step for MSFT’s AI monetization. We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""Mizuho was also very positive, writing:We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.Senad Karaahmetovic, Ambar Warrick, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.___Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

30,b3b054f8-222d-3a72-9304-f606a4bdc407,NFLX,2023-07-23,15 Richest Actors in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-richest-actors-world-041143469.html,1690085503,STORY,"['NFLX', 'HNST']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 richest actors in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 richest actors in the world.While celebrities in general, and actors in particular, have always been counted among the rich and famous, commanding the adoration of millions of fans, the richest actors in the world have never seen a net worth as high as right now. While many believe that actors do not deserve the riches they earn as the job does not require brilliance nor a lot of physical labor, the truth is that only a few actors make it to the very top, with their performances commanding a significant following, which in turn allows them to demand higher paychecks for their work. Further, movies and TV shows are universally popular thereby attracting large audience as compared to niche interests.One of the reasons why actors are earning more than ever before is due to the advent of streaming, which has made content more accessible than ever before. With the biggest streamers including Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) commanding hundreds of millions of subscribers, the importance of having popular shows and movies available for subscribers cannot be understated, which is why these streaming giants are spending extravagant amounts of money not just to gain rights to existing movies and TV shows, but create original content, for which actors are being paid tens of millions of dollars. Dwayne Johnson for example, was paid $20 million for Red Notice, a movie created by  Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) while Ryan Reynolds earned $26 million for Six Feet Under, another Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) production, all of which has gone to make the richest actors in the world even richer.Even though streaming is still a relatively new industry at less than two decades old, its exponential growth has seen many more competitors join in, with examples including HBO with Max, Hulu and several others. Because of this, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), once the undisputed king of streaming, lost nearly a million subscribers in YTD June 2022, and its stock plummeted. However, the company has gone on to post a huge recovery, with its share price increasing by over 150% in the last one year, showing that investing in the right streaming companies can still prove a potentially lucrative return.Story continues15 Richest Actors in the WorldTwocoms/Shutterstock.comAnother way that the richest actors in the world have multiplied their wealth many times over is through social media, and arguably the pioneer of this is Kim Kardashian. The reality TV star gained infamy from the release of a sex tape, but converted that into widespread popularity with a reality show starring her family, which in turn was leveraged into gaining hundreds of millions of followers across several social media platforms by maintaining an active presence on different platforms including Facebook and Twitter (see Kim Kardashian's stock portfolio).Most actors now command a major presence on social media, and can often charge hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, for a simple post. Of these social media platforms, Instagram, owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), is by far the most popular, where celebrities and even social media influences, can make a lot of money endorsing products if they have a large enough follower base. In fact, most celebrities are now on Instagram, allowing followers to have a more intimate look at their lives through a visual medium and the large user base of the platform allows celebrities to earn much more money for simple endorsements.However, many of the richest actors in the world don't derive a majority of their income from their actual acting roles, social media posts or endorsements; they earn through their businesses. Many of the richest actors and richest actresses have started to invest their significant earnings into businesses, or started their own businesses, which have earned them generational wealth. Be it Dwayne Johnson's many different pursuits, including Teremana Tequila, Jessica Alba's The Honest Company, Inc. (NYSE:HNST), Ryan Reynold's holdings in Mint Mobile which was sold to T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) or George Clooney's Casamigos which was sold to Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), actors' involvement in businesses has never been as strong and impactful as it is now. It doesn't hurt that since most successful celebrities already have a following in millions, it is easier for them to attract customers and the wealth earned from successful businesses is several magnitudes higher than what can be earned through starring in movies, no matter how successful. That is why the richest actors and actresses in the world still have a net worth well below some of the richest families in the world, as the latter's wealth is derived through generations of successful businesses.MethodologyIt wasn't an easy task to determine the richest actors and actresses in the world, mainly because no one really records this statistic. While you can find the net worth of any celebrity on random websites, most of which are unreliable to say the least, legitimate publications such as Forbes only maintain sometimes yearly lists of highest paid actors. To finalize our rankings, we used Forbes' richest actors list from 2018 to 2022 and its highest paid entertainers list of 2022, since there wasn't any such list in 2021. We assessed Kim Kardashian's net worth separately based on an article from Forbes confirming her as a billionaire. We separately also used BBC to determine Ryan Reynold's earning from his major business sales and any other such deals made in this time period. There are some notable exceptions such as Jessica Alba, who was worth $341 million in 2021 according to Forbes when The Honest Company, Inc. (NYSE:HNST) was expected to be valued somewhere around $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. However, the company's stock has completely collapsed since, losing more than 90% of its value and the company's current valuation of $187 million means that the proportionate wealth of Jessica Alba is just $37.5 million, which is not sufficient to make this list.15. Ben AffleckTotal earnings: $55 millionBen Affleck may be in the news now for his marriage to Jennifer Lopez, but his bankability in Hollywood has ensured he is able to consistently amass a massive fortune.14. Bradley CooperTotal earnings: $57 millionBradley Cooper made a very wise decision as the producer and actor in ""A Star is Born"" to not earn a salary but share in the profits. The runaway success of the movie ensured he made a fortune while even endorsement deals earn the major Hollywood star millions of dollars.13. Mark WahlbergTotal earnings: $58 millionMark Wahlberg has been one of Hollywood's most bankable actor for several years now, and while he's earned tens of millions of dollars from Netflix, he also works as a producer, not to mention a stake in his family's own burger chain, Wahlburgers.12. Will SmithTotal earnings: $121.5 millionWill Smith was one of the most popular actors in the world for decades, before losing most of his goodwill due to one moment of losing his temper. Smith is one of the celebrities who have leveraged social media to amplify their wealth and earns millions from various social media platforms, in addition to signing a deal with Snapchat for a lockdown series, not to mention a starring role in Netflix's ""Bright 2"".11. Adam SandlerTotal earnings: $137.5 millionAdam Sandler may not be one of the most critically acclaimed movie stars of all-time, but his deal with Netflix has ensured that he gets to make movies casting people close to him while also still being counted among the richest actors in the world. Adam Sandler has a four-movie $250 million deal with Netflix, which will ensure his continued appearance in our list for the foreseeable future.10. Chris HemsworthTotal earnings: $140.9 millionChris Hemsworth became a household name portraying Thor in the Marvel Universe, which is where he's earned most of his fortune from, commanding $15 million per movie and a share in the profits in addition.9. Jackie ChanTotal earnings: $143.5 millionOne of the most beloved actors of our time, Jackie Chan has continued to be active even in his 60s, earning a large part of his fortune acting in various movies, endorsements and producer credits. However, a lot of his recent earnings have to do with him owning his own line of movie theaters as well as other business ventures.8. Robert Downey Jr.Total earnings: $147 millionRobert Downey Jr. kickstarted the Marvel Universe, and rightfully was the highest paid actor in a franchise dominated by some of the biggest names in the industry. Spearheading the most successful franchise in history has allowed Robert Downey Jr. to command a massive payday for attaching himself to a movie.7. Akshay KumarTotal earnings: $154 millionThe only Bollywood actor among the richest actors in the world, Akshay Kumar is well-known for doing several films every single year, as well as his adherence to an efficient shooting system which allows him to wrap up a movie in just a couple of months, and sometimes even earlier. This high volume of work has allowed him to become the highest paid Bollywood actor.6. Tyler PerryTotal earnings: $165 millionTyler Perry's majority earnings come from the fact that he owns the content he produces and so continues to earn from work done several years ago, not to mention his Madea franchise, which alone has earned over $600 million.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Richest Actors in the World.Suggested articles:25 Top-Selling Beers in America25 Country Songs for Low Female Voices27 Best Places to Retire for Active AdultsDisclosure: None. 15 richest actors in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Prices are too high for many to afford, and yet it's still the epitome of the American Dream.Homeownership is also the key to getting rich, financial experts say. So when they can't afford to buy, they feel like failures, which can have ripple effects throughout their financial lives.""Deep down people believe renting is for losers. They have been told that in order to be successful in America, you have to buy a house,"" Sethi tells Fortune. ""Every day they wake up and they just feel awful. I don’t want you to feel awful.""It's become one of the personal finance expert's most controversial and argued-with claims: ""Renting can be a phenomenal financial choice."" Homeownership can be a good move for some, he says, but it shouldn't be viewed as solely an investment when it's more a lifestyle choice for most.Viewed purely from a financial standpoint, it is possible to make more on investments while renting, says Sethi. People often compare the mortgage to their monthly rental payment to make the case for owning, but that ignores all other homeownership costs, including closing costs, utilities, maintenance, insurance, taxes, and so on. In his eyes, that means homeownership can quickly become a ""bad"" investment, depending on your financial situation.Much of Sethi's work as a personal finance expert—in addition to writing books and hosting the Netflix show, Sethi produces a financial podcast each week helping couples manage their money—is helping people overcome the money myths they've been taught to get at what they actually want out of life.For example, Sethi suggests those who want to buy a house ASAP should write down those feels and interrogate them. Why is there a need to buy a house now? Where is the message coming from?Story continues""Americans are really good at making decisions they think will make them happy but make them deeply unhappy. 'Let me destroy my social network and move to the suburbs and take on insurmountable amounts of debt to own a home,'"" he says. ""You know we don't have to do that? You can choose what your rich life looks like.""He also suggests reframing renting in your mind. Is it really ""throwing money away,"" or is it fulfilling a need you have, which is having somewhere to live.And of course, run the numbers. Sethi says because of the emotional baggage that comes with buying a house, so many people don't consider what they can actually afford when it comes to their biggest lifetime purchase.""People spend more time comparing the price of soup at the grocery store than they do understanding an amortization table,"" he says, referencing the tool that shows you how much you will pay in principal and interest over time.""I refuse to accept you're going to make a seven-figure purchase just because your mom, dad, or uncle told you that real estate only goes up,"" he continues. ""That is not true and you need to understand the numbers.""Sethi encourages people to define their own ""Rich Life,"" or how they would ideally live, rather than simply checking off the boxes of someone else's. Do you want to retire in your 30s? Try every new restaurant in town? Build wealth to pass down to your children? Travel for half of the year?Get clear on the details, and consider whether homeownership fits into that. And it very well might—Sethi says owning a home doesn't always build wealth, but it does have profound lifestyle implications.

33,4b2d6e1f-72b3-3cf9-aa77-20ead2891294,ZTS,2023-07-23,Is Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-risky-investment-120040037.html,1690113640,STORY,['ZTS'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Zoetis What Is Zoetis's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Zoetis had US$6.59b in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$2.11b, its net debt is less, at about US$4.48b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Zoetis' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Zoetis had liabilities of US$1.92b due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.35b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$2.11b in cash and US$1.19b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$5.97b.Of course, Zoetis has a titanic market capitalization of US$84.8b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Zoetis has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.4. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 19.2 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. While Zoetis doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Zoetis can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Zoetis recorded free cash flow worth 58% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Zoetis's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is good too. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Zoetis is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Zoetis   you should know about.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

35,0fbeada6-35f1-3cd6-8256-67b3bb34fc2d,ILMN,2023-07-23,20 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down Syndrome,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-highest-rate-down-192501367.html,1690053901,STORY,"['NTRA', 'ILMN']","[In this detailed article, we'll talk about 20 countries with the highest rate of down syndrome. You can skip our analysis on progress in corporate healthcare sector on this front and go to 8 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down Syndrome. Each year, around 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome across the globe, which accounts for 1 in 700 babies born according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Currently, Ireland tops the countries with the highest rate of Down syndrome prevalence, as its incidence of the syndrome is reported to be 27.5 per 10,000 live births. Such a high disease incidence rate in the country has been linked to higher maternal age since the likelihood of having a child with DS significantly increases in women over the age of 35. Other countries with a high Down syndrome occurrence are Norway and Malta, with DS prevalence rates of 24.9 and 20, respectively. As pregnancy termination is illegal in Malta in all circumstances, even if an unborn baby is diagnosed with Down syndrome prenatally, the parents are not allowed to terminate it. Consequently, the country is struggling with a high DS incidence of 24.9 per 10,000 live births. If we talk about the US, every 1 in 1000 babies born in the country had Down syndrome in 2002. However, the incidence dropped to 1 in 1,200 babies by 2008, and the country’s DS occurrence percentage is 9 per 10,000 live births as of current.In stark contrast, Iceland and Denmark, with the help of advanced prenatal screening programs, reported near-zero birth rates of DS, with 100% and 97% termination rates for prenatally diagnosed DS pregnancies respectively.As a result of better care facilities, the average lifespan of Down syndrome patients has increased from 10 years to 47 years between 1960 and 2010s. Moreover, according to United Nations’ health guidelines, people with Down syndrome can lead better lives provided they have prenatal care, medical guidance, and community support. Story continuesSpeaking of community support for those suffering from health conditions, we have already covered 20 Countries with the Highest Rate of Dementia; give this insightful overview a read.Impact Of Prenatal Screening and Elective Termination on Down SyndromeAccording to the Down Syndrome Population Organization, there are 10.1 children per 10,000 live births with Down syndrome in Europe. While for Australia, the figure stands at 8.6 per 10,000 live births, owing to the advancement in prenatal screening. However, without elective termination, the current DS prevalence in Europe would have been 21.7 per 10,000 births. Ever since advanced prenatal screening became accessible, a significant number of pregnancies with Down syndrome have been diagnosed in Australia and consequently terminated. Births with Down Syndrome in Australia have reduced by 66% since the 1970s. So if it wasn’t for elective pregnancy termination after a prenatal screening, which shows that the fetus is growing with a chromosomal abnormality, there would have been 23,156 people with Down Syndrome in Australia. But because of timely diagnosis and the availability of safe pregnancy termination, the current Down Syndrome population is 13,426 in the country. Although the current number has gone up from 2,852 people with the syndrome in 1950, it’s still progress, given the nation’s population surge between the 1950s and 2020s. However, not all children born with Down syndrome are diagnosed prenatally because of a lack of screening availability or the expectant parents’ unwillingness to choose screening. In the aspect of state-of-the-art prenatal testing, Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN) is doing well with DNA sequencing and array-based technologies to bring down the incidence levels in countries with the highest rate of Down syndrome. Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)’s sequencing technology powers many non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPTs) used to screen common chromosomal abnormalities, including Down Syndrome. These tests look for genetic material from the baby in the mother’s blood and can be done early on in the pregnancy. Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN) also owns Verinata Health Inc, a company that developed the Verifi prenatal test to diagnose Edwards syndrome, Down syndrome, and Patau syndrome, among other aneuploidies (chromosome disorders). The reduction of Down syndrome in live birth rates is influenced by the number of people choosing prenatal testing, the accuracy of the screening test results, and parents’ decisions if there is a timely prenatal diagnosis. Another name making diagnosis easier for expectant parents is Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA) which has developed non-invasive methods to analyze tiny amounts of DNA, including fetal DNA in pregnant women. Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA) offers the Panorama test, a blood-based genetic test that screens common genetic abnormalities, including Down syndrome. Other diagnostic tests developed by Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA) are Vasistera and Single-Gene NIPT.20 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down Syndrome20 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down SyndromeOur Methodology We ranked countries with the highest rates of Down syndrome based on the syndrome’s prevalence per 10,000 people in the said countries’ populations. The prevalence of Down syndrome refers to the total number of existing cases (both new and old) in a specified population at a given time. Our sources to find the prevalence of Down syndrome in the world were WHO, European Health Information Gateway, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Down Syndrome Population Organization’s Europe and Australia Fact Sheets, Nature Journal, and UN.org, among others. Notably, some sources discuss Down syndrome rate by country out of 100,000 live births while others prefer the 10,000 scale. Therefore, to keep things straightforward and explain the condition’s occurrence, we ranked the countries’ incidence out of 10,000 live births. Put simply, if a country’s incidence is 20 in 10,000, it implies that out of every 10,000 babies born there, 20 have Down syndrome. Based on our data, here are 20 countries with the highest rate of Down syndrome:20. Australia Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 8.6 in 10,000Down syndrome is a significant public health concern in Australia, affecting approximately one in every 1,100-1,200 births. The Australian government, through a partnership with Down Syndrome Australia, has developed policies to improve the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome. The government's strategies include early intervention services, inclusive education initiatives, and vocational programs that encourage self-sufficiency. The country also leads in research in the field of non-invasive prenatal screening that can enhance early DS detection and informed decision-making. 19. Hungary Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 8.97 in 10,000Hungary is one of the countries with highest pravelence of down syndrome. Consistent efforts have been made in Hungary to address Down syndrome at medical and societal levels. The country has reliable prenatal screening programs to facilitate early diagnosis, owing to its strong health infrastructure. Some concerted initiatives are also dedicated to improving the quality of life for individuals with DS through accessible educational resources and specialized care. Notably, a focus on inclusivity in schools and workplaces is contributing to reducing stigmatization and enhancing societal integration for those with DS.18. United States Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 9 in 10,000Down syndrome affects 1 in every 900 live births in the US. That’s the reason National organizations like the National Down Syndrome Society have been instrumental in improving access to healthcare for DS affectees. Moreover, legislation like the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act offers financial support to make independent living possible for those with disabilities. 17. Albania Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 9.02 in 10,000The Albanian government has introduced specialized training for medical professionals to provide accurate diagnosis and betterment strategies for Down syndrome. Plus, non-profit organizations such as Down Syndrome Albania Foundation advocate for the rights of individuals with Down syndrome to include them in regular life sectors. But despite these advances, Albania is confronted with the challenge of ensuring equitable access to these services, particularly in rural areas.16. North MacedoniaDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 9.64 in 10,000Down syndrome incidence rate in North Macedonia is 9.64 per 10,000 live births and is recognized as a significant health concern. Therefore, the country’s National Health Care System provides a multi-disciplinary approach to contain this chromosomal condition. Its services span healthcare professionals, educationalists, and social workers. Some local non-profit organizations like Down Syndrome Center, in Skopje, also supplement the government’s efforts with resources by initiating DS-specific educational programs and family support projects. 15. United KingdomDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 10.1 in 10,000Down syndrome affects one in every 1,000 live births in the UK. The nation is known for its advanced healthcare system and offers sound medical and support services for those with Down syndrome. National organizations like the Down's Syndrome Association provide resources and advocacy. Advances in medical care have shifted the narrative from disability to ability and inclusion for DS sufferers. 14. Finland Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 10.2 in 10,000 In Finland, Down syndrome affects approximately one in 1000 births, attributable to the country's practice of less aggressive prenatal screening. Also, there’s a philosophical emphasis on respecting diversity of life in the nation which stops elective termination from becoming a norm in prenatally diagnosed conditions. Luckily, the country's legislation promotes the inclusion of specially-abled people in all aspects of life, so those dealing with this lifelong condition get sufficient representation. 13. SwitzerlandDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 11 in 10,000 The prevalence of Down syndrome is 11 in 10,000 in Switzerland. Although the country provides high-quality medical facilities for individuals with Down syndrome, the incidence remains a concern. Unlike some European counterparts, Switzerland has an extensive prenatal screening program, and a high percentage of pregnancies diagnosed with Down syndrome are terminated. These terminations lead to lower live birth rates of Down syndrome babies. 12. RussiaDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 11.5 in 10,000 Down syndrome is a common genetic disorder in Russia with an incidence similar to global averages, i.e., roughly 1 in every 1,100-1,200 live births. Sadly, societal stigmas still persist in the country, which has resulted in underreporting and, often, institutionalization of DS. Recent years have seen advancements in awareness and the government now implements inclusive education laws.  11. RomaniaDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 11.6 in 10,000According to WHO, Romania has an incidence rate of 1 in 1,000 live births for Down syndrome. Other concerning conditions that are prevalent in the country are Wilson disease, syndromic PID, and single-gene defects, among others. Access to specialized healthcare services and diagnostic programs for individuals with Down syndrome has been a crucial focus in the country's efforts to curtail the situation.  10. NetherlandsDown Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 11.9 in 10,000 Down syndrome is a significant health concern in the Netherlands, impacting about 12 in 10,000 births. Luckily, prenatal screening has been universally offered in the country since 2007 and has increased detection rates. Despite this, the stigma persists in the nation and prompts ongoing initiatives for public awareness and advocacy.9. Germany Down Syndrome Prevalence Incidence: 12.2 in 10,000  The incidence rate of Down syndrome is 12.2 in 10,000 live births in Germany. Although the introduction of prenatal screening has made this condition’s detection easier, elective termination rates remain relatively low. Interestingly, Germany's healthcare and social systems prioritize inclusion and support the integration of DS sufferers into mainstream society. Click to continue reading 8 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down Syndrome.Suggested Articles:20 Countries With The Highest Rate Of Diabetes20 Countries with Highest Rates of Infant Mortality20 Most Obese States in America in 2023Disclosure: None. 20 Countries With Highest Rate Of Down Syndrome is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:ILMN)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-illumina-inc-140013385.html,1690034413,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$233 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$180. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Illumina's current trading price of US$190 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Illumina What's The Opportunity In Illumina?According to my valuation model, Illumina seems to be fairly priced at around 4.97% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Illumina today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $181.47, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Illumina’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Illumina?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. In Illumina's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 51%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ILMN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the sporting goods industry, head directly to 5 Best Sporting Goods Stocks To Buy Now. According to The Business Research Company, the worldwide market for sports and athletic goods experienced notable growth, rising from $165.28 billion in 2022 to $179.1 billion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4%. Looking ahead, it is projected that this market will continue to expand, reaching $238.89 billion in 2027, with an estimated CAGR of 7.5%.Following a strong performance in 2021, the sporting goods industry has faced several obstacles over the past year, including the risk of a global recession, war in Europe, persistent supply chain challenges, and a rapid increase in interest rates, all of which have contributed to an uncertain and unpredictable global landscape. The sporting goods industry has been relatively fortunate when compared to many other sectors, as it has experienced substantial growth over the last two years, matching or even surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Moving forward, McKinsey &amp; Company sees reasons for optimism in the medium term, primarily due to a growing emphasis on health, fitness, and sports, which is expected to drive further opportunities for the industry. Despite the positive outlook for the medium term, the short-term prospects may present some constraints. Factors such as increasing costs, the possibility of a larger recession, and ongoing operational difficulties could create obstacles in early 2023. According to Colin Browne, interim president and CEO at Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA): “I believe it will take some time for demand and supply to right themselves, especially as I suspect the economic conditions may well continue to worsen as we go into 2023, with impacts on consumer confidence.”Don't Miss: 15 Hardest Sports in the World RankedAs per McKinsey &amp; Company’s Sporting Goods 2023 Report, unit sales during the first nine months of 2022 were 4%-8% below 2021 levels in the United States, and the impact on revenues was not offset by higher average selling prices. Athletic footwear and sportswear had a solid performance in 2021, with over 10% growth (CAGR) from 2019 to 2021. However, growth stalled in 2022 as economic pressures led to a decline in consumer demand. Despite these challenges, the outdoor category showed resilience by reporting 2022 revenues marginally higher than 2021, and 24% higher than pre-pandemic levels. This growth occurred even as units sold fell by 4.5% and average selling prices rose by 5%. Among the sub-categories, apparel and accessories experienced growth at 3% and 5%, respectively, while equipment and footwear declined by 4% and 3%. The boost in outdoor activities has been a positive factor for the outdoor categories, benefiting them over indoor-focused sports like swimming, which may have been impacted by facility closures due to rising electricity costs. In the US, outdoor activities primarily centered around ""backyard"" themes, providing support to categories such as camping equipment.Story continuesInvestors looking to diversify their portfolios by branching out in the sporting goods industry can buy stocks including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Our Methodology We selected the following sporting goods stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Sporting Goods Stocks To Buy NowMarch Marcho / Shutterstock.comBest Sporting Goods Stocks To Buy Now10. Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) designs, produces, and markets golf-related merchandise worldwide. The company is divided into four main segments – Titleist Golf Balls, Titleist Golf Clubs, Titleist Golf Gear, and FootJoy Golf Wear. On May 4, Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $1.36 and a revenue of $686.3 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.27 and $55.18 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 15 hedge funds held stakes worth $78.5 million in Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF), compared to 13 funds in the prior quarter worth nearly $50 million. D E Shaw is the leading position holder in the company, with 444,274 shares valued at $22.6 million. In addition to DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) is one of the best sporting goods stocks to invest in. Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Acushnet (GOLF) is a leading manufacturer of golf equipment, accessories and apparel. The company owns several top brands in golf, including Titleist and FootJoy. Golf experienced heightened demand as consumers looked for socially distanced leisure activities over the last several years. We expect some of this enthusiasm — especially from newer golfers — to wane over the next couple years and for the average number of rounds per golfer to normalize from a high in 2021. We also believe some demand for equipment and apparel was likely pulled forward.”9. Hibbett, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Hibbett, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB) specializes in athletic-inspired fashion items. The company’s retail stores carry a diverse selection of products, such as athletic footwear, fashionable sportswear, team sports gear, and related accessories.

(NASDAQ:HIBB), compared to 25 funds in the earlier quarter. John Hempton’s Bronte Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 519,435 shares worth $30.6 million. Here is what Roubaix Capital has to say about Hibbett, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“The second best short in the quarter was Hibbett Sports (HIBB), a sporting goods retailer. Many businesses were able to benefit from the spending shifts caused by the pandemic. For example, online retailers, companies that sell into the home improvement markets and grocery stores all saw varying degrees of improvement. We did not see HIBB as a clear beneficiary as they have historically underinvested in their online business. However, they managed to post very strong results during their third quarter from leisure spending trends and the stock reacted favorably. We shorted the strength of this rally and continue to hold our position as we do not see HIBB as a longer-term winner in its markets.”8. Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPWH) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter I added to Sportsman’s Warehouse (“SPWH”). SPWH is an outdoor sporting goods retailer with about half of their revenue coming from hunting &amp; shooting products (guns, ammo). I initiated our position back in December following their failed merger with Great Outdoors on the grounds of anti‐trust concerns. It appeared that the stock was being sold off indiscriminately by merger arbitrageurs and valuation seemed attractive, particularly after adjusting for the receipt of a $55mm termination payment and unwind of excess inventory.While the dust has largely settled from an investor base perspective, SPWH remains attractively priced with a few upcoming catalysts. Fundamentally the company is well positioned. Following the tragic Parkland school shooting two large competitors to SPWH, Dicks Sporting Goods and Walmart, made the decision to exit the category; their absence makes the competitive landscape for SPWH a lot more favorable than in prior years. Furthermore, it is no surprise that gun and ammo sales during covid experienced tremendous growth. Unlike prior cycles, however, this wave saw an increase in new gun buyers rather than purchases by existing owners. SPWH estimates that over the past 18 months the industry created 12mm new firearm owners; using a prior base of 100mm, this implies an increase to their addressable market of 12%. The company is executing on many other internal initiatives including store expansion, omni‐channel growth (e‐comm up to 15% of revenues), loyalty programs (at 3mm members) and new co‐branded credit cards…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is one of the top sporting goods stocks to invest in. The company is a specialty athletic footwear and apparel retailer operating in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the Middle East. On May 17, Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on July 28, to shareholders of record on July 14. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 25 hedge funds held stakes worth $633.8 million in Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter worth $312.2 million. Daniel Kretinsky’s Vesa Equity Investment is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 11.4 million shares worth just over $455 million. Here is what Miller Value Partners Deep Value Strategy has to say about Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into the Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”6.

(NYSE:PFE) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Pfizer's shares before the 27th of July in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 5th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.41 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.64 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Pfizer stock has a trailing yield of around 4.4% on the current share price of $37.4. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Pfizer paying out a modest 31% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 45% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Pfizer's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Pfizer earnings per share are up 7.6% per annum over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Pfizer has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.4% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Pfizer? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Pfizer is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Pfizer is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Pfizer looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&amp;A. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.Story continuesScott Kirby: Thank you, Kristina, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Before I discuss our financial performance for the second quarter, I'd like to first address the operational challenges at Newark at the end of last month. I am extremely proud of the people of United for all they did to recover under very challenging circumstances. Our pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, contact center teams and others went above and beyond to inform and assist our customers in an extremely stressful situation. We are now doing more than ever to mitigate the impact of weather, congestion and other infrastructure constraints at Newark, and frankly, to build a schedule at Newark is more manageable given the frequency of weather events and the very real operating constraints that exist there even on blue sky day.Brett will highlight just a few of those changes shortly. But we have already put them in motion, we’ve already starting to improve the working experience for our people and travel experience for our customers. A bigger picture, this quarter was yet another proof point that our United Next strategy was correct and is working almost exactly as we expected. Over the past couple of years, I've talked a lot about three exogenous constraints facing the industry. But also the fact that those very constraints and challenges are going to set the table for improved financial results for the airline industry. One, pilot shortages; two, supply chain disruptions; and three, infrastructure limitations. At United, we have control over the first two constraints, pilot and supply chain, and we mostly got ahead of the curve and had minimal issues there.But we're probably as exposed or the most exposed to the infrastructure constraint since our hubs are in some of the largest and most crowded airports in the country. So now we're taking even more action to give us the ability to operate more reliably despite the infrastructure constraints. That means we've had to lower our capacity plans for the second half and therefore, raised our CASM-ex guidance. But the reality is that our CASM-ex will be better than it otherwise would have been because there's nothing as expensive as running an off-schedule operation and these changes are designed to get our operations, particularly at Newark, working at a level that reflects the fact that it only has one set of parallel runway operating in the most crowded airspace in the world.The flip side of this coin, however, is that these exogenous constraints were also the basis of our United Next strategy, and it is off to an incredible even record setting start. This was an all-time record quarter for pretax earnings and EPS on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects our success in building a strategy to, one, aggressively hire pilots; two, grow our Mid-Con hubs; three, upgauge our domestic fleet; and four, expand our wide-body fleet and international exposure in response to the trends that we identified at the beginning of COVID. Importantly, we now expect to deliver earnings per share of $11 to $12, even with incremental conservatism in our cost in the back half of the year. The vision and strategic outlook that we first identified nearly three years ago is happening.Cost convergence is happening, which has changed our business dramatically on the domestic front. Long term, positive structural changes to the international markets are also apparent in our results. We continue to anticipate that the GDP relationship between airline revenues has been reset higher due to cost conversions and will continue to improve. The outlook for United and our United Next strategy is incredibly bright, as highlighted by our financial results this quarter. This quarter demonstrates that we're ahead of our planned targets and the challenges to emphasize that the industry backdrop gives us a clear path to our 14% pretax margin in 2026. As we march towards that goal, we're focused on setting the airline up for success. I'm also pleased that we've reached an agreement on an industry-leading contract with ALPA.The four-year agreement once ratified will deliver a meaningful pay raise and quality of life improvements for our pilots. Thanks to the team for getting this across the finish line. We are well on our way to being the best airline in the history of aviation. United Next gave us an unbeatable head start on that goal as long as we execute and execute we will. Thanks again to the United team. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brett.Brett Hart: Thank you, Scott. Thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, during the last week of June, we experienced one of the most challenging operational environments in United's history, impacting primarily our largest international departure hub, Newark. Our hub locations make us disproportionately prone to weather and then in the second quarter, weather was particularly challenging, with 25 major irregular operation days accounting for 75% of our second quarter cancellations. Despite this, we are focused on setting United up for success, and being able to recover more quickly in the future. We are implementing a few new initiatives in Newark that will improve our operation. First, we are reducing the total flying in the peak hours to align better with the capabilities of today's constrained operating environment.airline, airplaneemiel-molenaar-JOrUKpuMOeU-unsplashSecond, we expect to have additional gating as we bring the remaining six gates in Terminal A online, two of which are additional wide-body gates as well as make additional tactical changes at United. Third, we are adjusting our schedules to increase our out-and-back flying to limit the downline system impact of any cancellations or delays. Fourth, we are increasing our resources and crew scheduling and accelerating the timeline of our technology enhancements and automation. Lastly and importantly, our partnerships with the FAA and Port Authority are essential to the airline's success. Collaboration and communication amongst these groups has never been stronger. To that end, Scott and our government affairs team continue to remain actively engaged in working with the administration and leaders in Congress to pass an FAA reauthorization bill.Legislation that equips the FAA with the resources, tools and funding they need isn't just essential to the success of our industry, it's among the best investments that we could make for the traveling public in the U.S. economy right now. And we're committed to continuing to advocate for a smart FAA reauthorization bill and to get it passed quickly. These are only a few of the initiatives underway, but combined with lower capacity, these adjustments add approximately 1 to 2 points of incremental year-over-year pressure to our 2023 CASM-ex. Gerry will go into more detail. But running a successful and efficient airline is critical and United is laser-focused on getting our customers to their destinations safely and on time. As we work to respond to these challenges, we are also investing in our customer experience.Recently, we announced new mobile app features that support our customers during travel disruptions. These first-of-their-kind tools will allow customers to rebook, track their bags and get meal and hotel vouchers when eligible on their personal device. It is important for us to provide our customers the resources they need for flight or their flight at their fingertips, especially when things don't go as planned. As Scott mentioned, over the weekend, we reached a tentative agreement with our pilots represented by ALPA. We're thankful for the hard work our pilots put in every day, and this agreement is a representation of that. We are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by the AFA, and have new agreements in place for all other work groups.The United team continues to be resilient. We're making real-time changes that directly impact the travel experience for our customers and for our employees, day-to-day. Proud to be a member of this team. I want to thank everyone for their unwavering hard work. And with that, I'll pass it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue graph.Andrew Nocella: Thanks, Brett. I'd like to start off today by thanking the entire United team for their hard work and dedication in taking care of our customers, particularly during the final week of the quarter. Our financial results provide proof that our United Next plans are working and that the demand environment remains robust. United finished the second quarter with top line record quarterly revenues of [$14.2 billion]. Total revenues in the quarter were up 17%, ahead of our guidance of 14% to 16%. June was exceptionally strong and was our best revenue month ever. Since the start of June, we've had 13 of our 16 highest flown gross revenue days. TRASM in the quarter was down 0.4% and PRASM was up 2.2% with capacity up 17.5%.International results were exceptionally strong with passenger revenues up 44% year-over-year. International PRASM increased 13.3% year-over-year. Year-over-year PRASM results were strongest in the Pacific followed by the Atlantic and then Latin America. The resurgence of the United Pacific entity has been the most transformative. Margins for our global long-haul flying continued to outpace domestic margins. Our second quarter capacity deployment plans leaned in international flying with 27% more capacity year-over-year, which proved advantageous. International ASMs represent 45.4% of United's 2Q capacity, up 2 points from 2019. Domestic passenger revenues were up 7.8% on 10.5% more capacity year-over-year, largely in line with our expectations at the start of the quarter.Domestic PRASM was down 2.4%, but that was a fantastic outcome as it compares to an exceptionally strong Q2 of '22. We expect similar or slightly better results for domestic PRASM in the third quarter. Our RM setup for the quarter proved to be the right one. We held back seats early in the booking curve, saving them for higher yields and closing bookings, and we ended the quarter with record top line results. The business recovery remained stable. Revenue from international travelers flying for business grew 40% year-over-year, with 10% growth in the -- on domestic business travelers. On a ticketed basis, business travel revenue continues to trend roughly flat to 2019. Cargo revenues have normalized post pandemic. Yields were down 38% versus 2022, but do remain up 29% versus '19.We expect yields in the third quarter to be consistent with Q2. Healthy cargo revenues and yields are helping drive incremental profitability to our global long-haul flying. MileagePlus had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% year-over-year. We broke records this quarter for all key measurements from new card acquisitions to new member enrollment. Ancillary revenue from bags and seats hit a record $1 billion in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Per passenger ancillary revenue increased 8% to $23.79. Replacement of single class RJs with mainline aircraft with multiple types of seat upgrade opportunities is a key driver of our revenue growth. Premium leisure demand remains very strong across the board. Our domestic first class capacity is up 4% from 2019, but RASM growth in that cabin is 12 points stronger than the main cabin even with corporate traffic not fully recovered.Our global long-haul Polaris product is also offsetting the loss of corporate business revenue with premium leisure demand and validates the size of our Polaris cabins post-pandemic are correct for United hubs. For Q3, we expect the total revenue will be up 10% to 13% year-over-year with capacity up approximately 16%. The demand environment remains strong, and September and October looked particularly strong relative to both 2019 and July and August. Another sign that seasonality has changed in the summer peak period is more spread out relative to the past. Once again, Q3 capacity deployment focuses on international markets with capacity expected to be up 23% versus 13% for domestic. We believe international revenue will continue to outperform domestic revenue in the third quarter across the globe other than Latin America.Overall, our domestic margins are now back to 2019 levels while our international margins are trending well above where they were in '19. Earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our Pacific flying this fall with new nonstop service from Manila to San Francisco. We also announced a second daily flight from San Francisco to Taipei, a new daily nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and will resume our service between Los Angeles and Narita as planned. These additions to our key Pacific destinations are in addition to our previously announced expansion plan to the South Pacific. While international flying remains our focus, we also have plans to improve domestic margins by rebuilding and enhancing connectivity versus 2019, grow and engage faster than any other carrier and staying focus on our existing set of hubs.Domestic connectivity fell materially in the pandemic because we decided to retire about 300 regional jets. But our connectivity is growing every month as we take United Next deliveries, and that will continue to drive PRASM higher each month. Like the period from 2017 to 2019 when we grew RASM and margins by growing connectivity, we'll do it once again but this time with large mainland jets preferred by our customers. Gauge has also been a key gap and opportunity for United, larger gauge narrow-bodies with 190 or more seats operate with the best single line aisle margins in North America. The introduction of the A321 and MAX 10 were always a key enabler of our United Next age growth and margin growth. The potential of these larger jets is proven and further upside to United Airlines when we finally enter the fleet.I also want to add to Scott and Brett's comments about Newark and our United Next plans. United Next always contemplated that the only way to grow Newark was upgauging from regional to mainline flying. We expected that to lead to higher growth in seats and ASM at Newark even though the total number of flights would not be growing. Our growth in Newark has always been contingent upon larger aircraft, not more aircraft. While we need to cut departures -- while, may need a couple departures more than planned, we don't believe these changes will impact our long-term capacity from Newark due to the use of larger gauge aircraft. And with that, I will turn it over to Gerry to talk about our financial results. Gerry?Gerry Laderman: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that for the second quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly pretax earnings in the United's history of $2.2 billion. Our earnings per share of $5.03 was also an all-time record. And in addition, we produced a record second quarter pretax margin of 15.3%, 3 points higher than second quarter of 2019 and ahead of our expectations. This exceptional performance was driven by stronger-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected fuel prices. The severe weather at the end of June, which drove multiple consecutive days of strained operations, did lead to a 1 point reduction in capacity for the quarter. We also incurred incremental disruption related costs that weren't anticipated at the time of our guidance.The capacity loss and added costs led to a CASM-ex impact of approximately 1.5 points for the quarter. Excluding this impact, until June 24, we were trending below the midpoint of our CASM-ex range for the quarter, an indication that our core costs remain under control. And for the rest of the year, the operational and scheduling changes that Brett discussed have reduced our full year capacity plans from our prior expectations, and we now expect full year capacity to be up approximately 18% versus 2022. Additionally, our CASM-ex guidance now incorporates an expectation of additional incremental costs in order to address the operational challenges. Specifically, for the third quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up 2% to 3% with capacity up approximately 16%, both versus the third quarter of last year.When combined with our results for the second quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate our full-year CASM-ex to be up approximately 1% to 2% versus last year. However, just like the second quarter, outside of the revisions I discussed, our core costs for the rest of the year are trending as expected. Furthermore, our CASM-ex expectation for the year continues to include the impact of our recently announced agreement with our pilots. Turning to earnings. The strong revenue environment and moderate fuel prices continue to provide strength to our bottom line. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $3.85 to $4.35, with a fuel price of $2.50 to $2.80. More importantly, given our second quarter performance and third quarter outlook, we are raising our full year earnings per share expectation to the top half of our previous guidance range of $10 to $12.On fleet, we took delivery of 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the second quarter and paid for 10 of those aircraft with cash. We expect to take delivery of 28 737 MAX aircraft in the third quarter and also look forward to our first Airbus A321neo later this fall. We continue to expect our full year adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8.5 billion. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $21 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. We are comfortable with our current level of liquidity, particularly given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1.3 billion of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by a pool of recently delivered Boeing MAX aircraft with an interest rate of 5.8% which was attractive in the current interest rate environment.Additionally, we prepaid $1 billion of floating rate debt, which carried a current coupon of over 9%. Our adjusted net debt is now down almost $3 billion since the end of 2022 and $6 billion since the end of 2021. With the reduction in debt and the improvement in earnings, at the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month adjusted net debt-to-EBITDAR ratio improved by a full turn to 2.4x versus the end of the first quarter, putting us back to where we were prior to the pandemic and ahead of pace to achieve our target of less than 3x by the end of 2023. We also continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year, including the impact of our new pilot agreement. In conclusion, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and believe we're adequately mitigated against additional operational risk in the back half of the year.I'm extremely proud of the United team for delivering our strong financial results. Six months ago, when we first announced our full year EPS guidance, we were met with skepticism from some of you listening. Now more than halfway through the year, as we increase our EPS guidance, I hope all of you are as comfortable as we are with the value of the United Next plan, where we continue to march towards meeting our long-term path target in delivering for our customers, employees and shareholders.

To skip the detailed analysis of the travel and cruise line industry, go directly to the 5 Most Luxurious Cruise Lines.The travel and tourism industry has played a significant role in the global economy since World War II. Before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the globe, the industry accounted for 10.4% of the global GDP. In 2019, 1.5 billion people took trips outside their countries. As per our previous report, in 2019, international travelers injected $640 million into the US economy each day which accounted for 2.9% of the country’s GDP.Covid-19 was the biggest hiccup faced by the travel industry in decades. The industry lost $4.5 trillion in GDP and 62 million people lost their jobs due to the pandemic. However, the industry has started to recover faster than expected, and in 2022, the travel and tourism industry accounted for 7.6% of the global GDP, which is still 23% below the pre-pandemic levels, yet showed a 22% increase from 2021. United Nations World Tourism Organization believes that international travel could reach around 80% to 95% of the pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Ernst &amp; Young’s Americas Hospitality Sector Leader, Umar Riaz, believes that the future of the travel industry seems secure and will perform well in 2023. He said:“...it’s my opinion that given the current dynamics of the travel industry, even if there is a mild recession in the next six months or so, the travel industry will still perform strongly.”Some travel stocks have also proven the strong recovery of the industry. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has gained over 48% in the last twelve months and nearly 71% year-to-date at the time of writing on July 18. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) saw immediate effects of the pandemic in 2020 and between January and March of the year, the company stock experienced an almost 40% decline. Nevertheless, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock price increased by 69% in the last 12 months and 44.62% year-to-date.Story continuesThe Cruise Line IndustryJust like the rest of the travel industry, the cruise industry also received a massive blow after the pandemic lockdowns as a lot of the cruise destinations experienced second and third locked down periods after the initial one in 2020. However, the industry still showed signs of recovery in 2021 and the number of cruise line passengers increased 96% year-over-year to 13.9 million which was still approximately 114% lower than 2019 levels of 29.7 million passengers globally. Nonetheless, 2023 has been an amazing year for the cruise line industry, and companies like Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

The CEO further added:“Net yields in constant currency turned positive in the second quarter, compared to 2019 as we drove cruise ticket prices above 2019, while maintaining record onboard revenue growth and continuing to close the gap on occupancy. In fact, net per diems in constant currency were up 7.5% over 2019 in the second quarter. This was 4.5 points better than the midpoint of guidance, which we were able to achieve while meeting our forecasted occupancy.”In the wake of the recovery of the industry, cruise lines are also using capital to expand their portfolio to keep up with the increasing cruise travel demand. The privately held Scenic Luxury Cruises and Tours is planning on adding three of its ships to start sailing in the Caribbean for the first time. On the other hand, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Nick?Nicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. A long way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where you breakthrough into new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time, as we continue to have significant headwinds.And there's always turbulence variation from market-to-market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by wielding the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement, and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold, but here they are. As reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times.Now let's talk about the earnings. OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3%. And our OpCo operating margin, the operating margin -- it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, BAFO. When I said new levels, I mean it. For financial services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year. And the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27. I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear.Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all these central categories. Drivers in vehicle repair are fairly understood. Car parks growing, getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, greater scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level.I think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing abundant of cars and trucks in the repair base or parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month as with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions, and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our Repair Information Group and our Tools Group are well positioned to take advantage of that.Now on to the critical industries or our commercial and industrial group or C&amp;I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence, and the attended variations from country-to-country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space that cover exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs.Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be. Also begin the period with industrial transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever sees the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us. Now there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine war, we see that weaknesses in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working.Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains. Overall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing profitable new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes, with advanced training programs, with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future.Well, that's a market overview. Now let's move to the segments. For the C&amp;I Group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter. Our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia-Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan and the yen was weak was some offset. But our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing.So C&amp;I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16%, one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter of last year. The industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building in Kenosha registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recoveries of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all of our industrial segments. Beyond the industrial division and C&amp;I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications.Torque accuracy is rising an importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ATC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations. Imagine working out of plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem.Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools, identifying missing items, tracing who signed them out and where are those to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&amp;I, and you can see it in the quarter's results. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7% reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the pre-pandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3% [indiscernible] this is an eye-popping number. So the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability.We are confident in the strength of our van network and that believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so. Now when you think of the Tools Group profitability, which is a pretty important subject this time. You think about hand tools, that high margin lineup was -- they were up -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi-trucks that were struggling to do that.So to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design, quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirm that it solved the problem. And that 3D tool, SWR5 90-degree special Crowfoot Wrench is being made right now at our Elizabethton Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make truck repair easier. The techs love it, and we kind of like the margins. Profitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our two piece horizontal bushing adapter set.The BJP1 BKS2 [ph], these names are something, text at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and store control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed two new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good bit for the new suspension and say two hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation. SNL a while ago, SNL's [indiscernible] said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears.Our franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving. And the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales. A sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend was our latest tool storage unit, the KMP1023ZLT7, a 72-inch Master Series Roll Cab paining with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop, but beyond the eye-popping optics the box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment, 14 drawers, including three spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right at hand.It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space equipment. I guess five power outlets and two USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed drawer, makes for easy organization with green NV color coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energize franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success. Mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain. Now visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives.And now let's go on to RS&amp;I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with -- gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4%. Up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice. As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&amp;I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new SOLUS+ diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features. including a two second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting.It supports the latest communication protocols, and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events. SOLUS+, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust. New powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with advantage, part of RS&amp;I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&amp;I's strong growth. Take our Challenger Lift Operation in Louisville.The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting task and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive magazine Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on. RS&amp;I improving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability.The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. Overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margins strong in every segment. OpCo OI margin 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?work safetySuwin/Shutterstock.comAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.191 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia-Pacific were down low single-digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year. As gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments, contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services up 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year. Financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year.As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&amp;I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022. This is largely due to increased volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses.Operating earnings for the C&amp;I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of Power Tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points. Turning to the RS&amp;I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation.The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved a 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&amp;I Group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year.Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year.In the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables.Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter.Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4x compared to 2.5x at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance.I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?Nicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength, critical industry is accelerating RS&amp;I growth, both in -- growth in both dealerships and independent shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency. C&amp;I extending in the critical industries. We're opening new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%.160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency and Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results, representing new heights highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach.

Amid this earnings rush, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon and is expected to announce another 0.25% increase in its benchmark interest rate.The economic calendar will also keep investors busy with the first read on second quarter GDP, two looks at consumer confidence, inflation data, and an initial look at manufacturing activity in July all on the schedule.This headline blitz will follow a week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) take on a leadership role in the market, with the Blue Chip index rising 2.1% during the week and finishing a 10th straight winning session on Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) served as the week's laggard, falling 0.6%.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 split the difference, rising 0.7%.The Nasdaq was dragged down by results from Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) that prompted investors to pare their exposure to two of this year's tech highfliers. Whether this pattern continues to play out during earnings season will be one of this week's key storylines for investors.End of the Fed hikes?The US central bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday with Fed Chair Jay Powell set to hold a press conference a half hour later.Data from the CME Group on Friday showed markets pricing in a 99.8% chance the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate target range by another 0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%. This would bring the fed funds rate to its highest level since 2001.""After remaining on hold at its June FOMC meeting, we look for the Fed to raise the target range for the Federal funds rate by 25bp to 5.25-5.50%,"" Bank of America economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note on July 19. ""The cooling of the economy is only happening slowly, and we think most committee members believe further rebalancing of supply and demand is needed to ensure disinflation will continue.""Story continuesPowell's comments will be in focus for investors as the debate is sure to continue through the summer over whether an additional rate increase later this year will be necessary.""In the press conference, we look for Chair Powell to provide more clarity on what markers the Committee would need to see to be comfortable moving into an extended hold,"" Morgan Stanley's chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Thursday. ""For example ... Governor Waller expressed that if the next two readings on core inflation 'look like the last two, the data would suggest maybe stopping.' A similar message from Powell would suggest to us a lengthy hold is in store.""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on June 21, 2023.

""What are they doing specifically? How are they going to monetize it? And when they monetize it, when do we start to see the goodies?""Because everybody can talk the marketing spin, but I need to see some tangible impacts on the P&amp;L. You better give it that to me. At least guide to it for the next couple of quarters, because I'm going to start to believe that it's all smoke.""The coming week will also provide more data on the health of the consumer, with results from McDonald's (MCD), Domino's (DPZ), and Chipotle being closely watched for signs of trade downs or pullbacks in spending.Last week, earnings from big banks and airlines largely showed a consumer that's still willing to spend, a bullish sign not just for these companies but the overall economy as the US continues to fight off a recession.Still, companies are reporting earnings declines.After reports from 18% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, 75% have reported earnings per share above estimates, below the five-year average of 78%, per FactSet. Meanwhile, 61% of companies have reported revenues above estimates, below the five-year average of 69% and the 10-year average of 63%.Entering the crucial earnings week, the stock market rally has notably broadened.After much was made about the 'Magnificent Seven' driving the S&amp;P 500 higher this year, Energy (XLE) and Health Care (XLV) closed out last week with four straight days of gains.""Profit cycle is what matters for Value/cyclicals vs. Growth,"" Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian wrote on Friday.

51,7816c39c-1e05-3e9b-888f-3d15f626a261,DIS,2023-07-23,An Intrinsic Calculation For The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Suggests It's 47% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-walt-disney-company-110057519.html,1690110057,STORY,['DIS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Walt Disney fair value estimate is US$165Walt Disney's US$87.18 share price signals that it might be 47% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 41% higher than Walt Disney's analyst price target of US$117In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.23bUS$9.90bUS$12.1bUS$16.4bUS$19.5bUS$22.2bUS$24.5bUS$26.5bUS$28.1bUS$29.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 18.91%Est @ 13.87%Est @ 10.34%Est @ 7.87%Est @ 6.14%Est @ 4.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$6.6kUS$8.3kUS$9.4kUS$11.7kUS$12.7kUS$13.3kUS$13.5kUS$13.3kUS$13.0kUS$12.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$114bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$29b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$440bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$440b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$187bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$301b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$87.2, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.151. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 best sports stadiums in the world.Sports have always been immensely popular in the general population, be it Roman charioteers thousands of years ago or stars across various sports now. After all, even today, the top two personalities on Instagram, with the most followers in the world (over one billion combined) are both footballers. 9 of the top 10 posts on Instagram, including the most-liked picture in history, are from Messi and Ronaldo as well, just signifying how sports are continuing to increase in popularity. According to Globe Newswire, the global sports industry was worth $486 billion in 2022 and grew to $512 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 5.2%. In the next four years, the CAGR is expected to remain above 5% and will deliver a valuation of nearly $624 billion in 2027.Because of the huge amounts of money in sports, many billionaires, major corporations and even countries are starting to buy sports team across various franchises as they continue to become more valuable. One of the biggest reasons behind this is lucrative television broadcasting deals. In the Premier League, the richest league in soccer and also home to some of the best sports stadiums in the world, the league's collective broadcasting deals are worth £4.8 billion from 2022/2023 to 2024/2025 and increase consistently across the years. More and more companies are also attempting to get into broadcasting deals with the traditional heavyweight in Sky Sports being challenged by BT and Amazon Prime Video. Meanwhile, the NBA currently ears $2.6 billion every year from The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). Separately, the NFL has a long-term television rights deal which will earn it around $100 billion across a decade.25 Best sports stadiums in the worldPhoto by Mario Klassen on UnsplashThere are various other sports and leagues across the world earning billions, which is why billionaires such as the Glazers Family (though not among the richest families in the world) purchased Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU) and Mark Cuban purchased the Dallas Mavericks, which isn't one of the most valuable sports companies in the world but is not far off. The Glazers family bought Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU) for £790 million in 2005 and now, less than two decades later, are looking to sell it for  £1.8 billion, which will provide a hefty return on their investment, with one of the allures of the club being its stadium Old Trafford, considered to be among the most famous and beautiful stadiums in Europe, and the world as well. In addition, nowadays, Middle Eastern countries are showing a huge interest in major football teams with some of those being home to the best sports stadiums in the world, starting with the purchase of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour in 2008 while investing heavily in it, propelling it from mediocrity to winning prestigious trophies including the most prestigious club football trophy in the UEFA Champions League in 2023. Meanwhile, Paris Saint German, a French football team is owned by Qatar Sports Investments, which in turn is owned by the Qatari government. Realizing the importance of being able to improve its global image through sports, Qatar also hosted the FIFA World Cup 2022, spending billions but achieving a level of goodwill hard to come by in any other way, in a move many have decried as sportswashing. Nowadays, Saudi Arabia has entered the fray, not only paying exorbitant amounts to Cristiano Ronaldo to lure him from Manchester United, but offering generational wealth to many other footballers in a bid to improve its league structure.Story continuesOne of the most important assets a sports team has is its stadium. Nowadays, stadiums are an important part of sports culture, no matter what the sport is, and a team's influence is also somewhat tied to the quality of the stadium it owns. Further, the bigger a stadium, the higher number of seats it has and the greater the revenue that can be earned on each matchday, which is why some of the best sports stadiums in the world are also those with a high capacity. Nowadays, many sports stadiums are being used not just for sporting events for the local team but for hosting concerts and hosting other sports teams too. The amenities offered are extravagant too, from skywalks to cheese rooms to luxurious suites. Take Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for example. Built in 2019, the stadium cost over £1 billion and even though the club had to take on a huge debt for its construction, its important to the club's ambitions cannot be understated.Another way that a stadium earns significant money for its sports team is through licensing naming rights. The reason Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is still named as such is because of the fact that its naming rights are yet to be sold. Generally, companies pay top dollar to have their name associated with a stadium, especially if its among the best stadiums in the world, for a defined period of time. One of the most famous examples of this is the MetLife Stadium which is the home of the New York Giants and the New York Jets, whose naming rights were purchased by MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. Meanwhile, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) acquired rights to one of the most historic stadiums in Europe in Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium, home to F.C. Barcelona, in a deal worth $310 million. We will further discuss later some of the best stadiums in the world and the companies who own their naming rights.The impact of stadiums could also be felt during the coronavirus pandemic, when teams often had to play in empty stadiums because of social distancing measures. A unique solution to this could be through the use of VR or AR, where possibilities include allowing the user to feel as if they are at the stadium and even view the match from multiple angles. While this technology still seems to be in its infancy, linking sports to the metaverse could result in a hugely mutually beneficial relationship.MethodologyTo determine the best sports stadiums in the world, we consulted several websites including Google Arts &amp; Culture, Bleacher Report, At the Buzzer and Sports Management Degree Hub, which have already assessed such stadiums, including the best sports facilities in the world. We then calculated the average ranking of each stadium based on the number of lists they appeared in. Where one stadium only appeared in one list, the list's rank was the one assigned to it. For stadiums which tied in rankings, we ranked higher the stadiums with a bigger capacity, which is why some of these stadiums are also among the top 20 biggest stadiums in the world. We also excluded some of the most famous venues in the world including racecourses and golf courses which are technically not stadiums, in addition to stadiums with a capacity under 10,000.25. Madison Square GardenCapacity: 19,500One of the most iconic stadiums in the world, Madison Square Garden has been home to some of the most famous events of all-time, including Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals and concerts from some of the biggest celebrities in the world.

Beijing National StadiumCapacity: 80,000The Beijing National Stadium is also called the Bird's Nest because of its shape and is considered to be among the best stadiums in the world, and was used primarily throughout the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.14.

To skip the detailed analysis of the travel and cruise line industry, go directly to the 5 Most Luxurious Cruise Lines.The travel and tourism industry has played a significant role in the global economy since World War II. Before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the globe, the industry accounted for 10.4% of the global GDP. In 2019, 1.5 billion people took trips outside their countries. As per our previous report, in 2019, international travelers injected $640 million into the US economy each day which accounted for 2.9% of the country’s GDP.Covid-19 was the biggest hiccup faced by the travel industry in decades. The industry lost $4.5 trillion in GDP and 62 million people lost their jobs due to the pandemic. However, the industry has started to recover faster than expected, and in 2022, the travel and tourism industry accounted for 7.6% of the global GDP, which is still 23% below the pre-pandemic levels, yet showed a 22% increase from 2021. United Nations World Tourism Organization believes that international travel could reach around 80% to 95% of the pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Ernst &amp; Young’s Americas Hospitality Sector Leader, Umar Riaz, believes that the future of the travel industry seems secure and will perform well in 2023. He said:“...it’s my opinion that given the current dynamics of the travel industry, even if there is a mild recession in the next six months or so, the travel industry will still perform strongly.”Some travel stocks have also proven the strong recovery of the industry. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has gained over 48% in the last twelve months and nearly 71% year-to-date at the time of writing on July 18. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) saw immediate effects of the pandemic in 2020 and between January and March of the year, the company stock experienced an almost 40% decline. Nevertheless, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock price increased by 69% in the last 12 months and 44.62% year-to-date.Story continuesThe Cruise Line IndustryJust like the rest of the travel industry, the cruise industry also received a massive blow after the pandemic lockdowns as a lot of the cruise destinations experienced second and third locked down periods after the initial one in 2020. However, the industry still showed signs of recovery in 2021 and the number of cruise line passengers increased 96% year-over-year to 13.9 million which was still approximately 114% lower than 2019 levels of 29.7 million passengers globally. Nonetheless, 2023 has been an amazing year for the cruise line industry, and companies like Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) have shown it with their stock price gains and were mentioned among our best multibagger stocks for 2024. Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL) also cast its Q2 2023 earnings call on June 26 where the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Climate Officer, Josh Weinstein said that the company experienced a “phenomenal wave season” in the first half of 2023 and is still going strong. The CEO further added:“Net yields in constant currency turned positive in the second quarter, compared to 2019 as we drove cruise ticket prices above 2019, while maintaining record onboard revenue growth and continuing to close the gap on occupancy. In fact, net per diems in constant currency were up 7.5% over 2019 in the second quarter. This was 4.5 points better than the midpoint of guidance, which we were able to achieve while meeting our forecasted occupancy.”In the wake of the recovery of the industry, cruise lines are also using capital to expand their portfolio to keep up with the increasing cruise travel demand. The privately held Scenic Luxury Cruises and Tours is planning on adding three of its ships to start sailing in the Caribbean for the first time. On the other hand, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) is preparing to row out the largest cruise ship ever built into the ocean which will be in service by early 2024.

56,8f46e55b-4b26-3009-8f0b-ff25bc4ba411,CMCSA,2023-07-23,Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) investors will be pleased with their favorable 37% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcasts-nasdaq-cmcsa-investors-pleased-110029286.html,1690110029,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 22% over five years, which is below the market return. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 0.7%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Comcast's earnings per share are down 23% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. Given that EPS is down, but the share price is up, it seems clear the market is focussed on other aspects of the business, at the moment.In contrast revenue growth of 6.2% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Comcast is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthComcast is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Comcast stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Comcast the TSR over the last 5 years was 37%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveComcast shareholders are up 3.9% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 7% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Comcast that you should be aware of before investing here.But note: Comcast may not be the best stock to buy.

Amid this earnings rush, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon and is expected to announce another 0.25% increase in its benchmark interest rate.The economic calendar will also keep investors busy with the first read on second quarter GDP, two looks at consumer confidence, inflation data, and an initial look at manufacturing activity in July all on the schedule.This headline blitz will follow a week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) take on a leadership role in the market, with the Blue Chip index rising 2.1% during the week and finishing a 10th straight winning session on Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) served as the week's laggard, falling 0.6%.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 split the difference, rising 0.7%.The Nasdaq was dragged down by results from Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) that prompted investors to pare their exposure to two of this year's tech highfliers. Whether this pattern continues to play out during earnings season will be one of this week's key storylines for investors.End of the Fed hikes?The US central bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday with Fed Chair Jay Powell set to hold a press conference a half hour later.Data from the CME Group on Friday showed markets pricing in a 99.8% chance the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate target range by another 0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%. This would bring the fed funds rate to its highest level since 2001.""After remaining on hold at its June FOMC meeting, we look for the Fed to raise the target range for the Federal funds rate by 25bp to 5.25-5.50%,"" Bank of America economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note on July 19. ""The cooling of the economy is only happening slowly, and we think most committee members believe further rebalancing of supply and demand is needed to ensure disinflation will continue.""Story continuesPowell's comments will be in focus for investors as the debate is sure to continue through the summer over whether an additional rate increase later this year will be necessary.""In the press conference, we look for Chair Powell to provide more clarity on what markers the Committee would need to see to be comfortable moving into an extended hold,"" Morgan Stanley's chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Thursday. ""For example ... Governor Waller expressed that if the next two readings on core inflation 'look like the last two, the data would suggest maybe stopping.' A similar message from Powell would suggest to us a lengthy hold is in store.""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on June 21, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Earnings rushOn the corporate side, Microsoft and Alphabet are set to report earnings on Tuesday after the market closes. On Wednesday, Meta and Chipotle (CMG) will highlight the schedule.Investors will also keep a close eye on results from Verizon (VZ) and AT&amp;T (T) — due out Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively — with these companies set to report for the first time since an early July report from The Wall Street Journal about lead-sheathed cables laid by telecom giants sent those stocks sharply lower.Big tech earnings should provide investors with a fresh update on the latest in artificial intelligence and the state of the cloud industry.As recently as last week, AI headlines were still pushing stocks higher. Apple (AAPL) shares popped nearly 1% after a report the tech giant may be building its own form of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock jumped after the company announced a $30-per-month AI-related integration that will be tied to Microsoft 365.Some analysts think that catalyst could be enough to counteract any slowdown in growth that might still be occurring with the company's cloud unit, Azure.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at Build, the company's annual conference for software developers Monday, May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Speaking with Yahoo Finance Live last week, Independent Solutions Wealth Management portfolio manager Paul Meeks said last quarter, companies had a simple message on AI-related initiatives: ""I'm doing it.""This quarter will be a different story.""Now what I need to see are some tangible benefits that are going to positively impact these companies' P&amp;L,"" Meeks said. ""What are they doing specifically? How are they going to monetize it? And when they monetize it, when do we start to see the goodies?""Because everybody can talk the marketing spin, but I need to see some tangible impacts on the P&amp;L. You better give it that to me. At least guide to it for the next couple of quarters, because I'm going to start to believe that it's all smoke.""The coming week will also provide more data on the health of the consumer, with results from McDonald's (MCD), Domino's (DPZ), and Chipotle being closely watched for signs of trade downs or pullbacks in spending.Last week, earnings from big banks and airlines largely showed a consumer that's still willing to spend, a bullish sign not just for these companies but the overall economy as the US continues to fight off a recession.Still, companies are reporting earnings declines.After reports from 18% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, 75% have reported earnings per share above estimates, below the five-year average of 78%, per FactSet. Meanwhile, 61% of companies have reported revenues above estimates, below the five-year average of 69% and the 10-year average of 63%.Entering the crucial earnings week, the stock market rally has notably broadened.After much was made about the 'Magnificent Seven' driving the S&amp;P 500 higher this year, Energy (XLE) and Health Care (XLV) closed out last week with four straight days of gains.""Profit cycle is what matters for Value/cyclicals vs. Growth,"" Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian wrote on Friday.

The U.S. travel sector has taken off again, but the journey toward stock-price recovery is still filled with turbulence. Nevertheless, it’s imperative to separate the wheat from the chaff and avoid a long list of doomed travel stocks.Americans are again embracing the joy of travel again, with passenger numbers mirroring pre-pandemic levels. However, the financial health of most travel companies is still on shaky ground, with the focus of many companies split between rewarding shareholders and paying down the mountain of debt accumulated during the pandemic survival phase.With the prospect of a looming recession, investors need to tread carefully. The 2008 recession saw consumer expenditures drop significantly, so it is imperative to steer clear of high-risk travel stocks. With that said, here are seven unstable travel stocks I think are worth avoiding right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLyft (LYFT)the Lyft (LYFT) logo shown on a mobile phone.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comLyft’s (NASDAQ:LYFT) recent leadership shakeup has attracted a swirl of predictions over its trajectory, tied to its ambitious push for operational efficiency. This drive, however, has garnered mixed sentiment from investors, with polarizing views over the company’s ability to outpace its competitors. Lyft’s refocused strategy points to a roadmap designed to streamline operations, while effectively reinforcing its service quality.On the flip side, its primary competitor Uber (NYSE:UBER) boasts a broader footprint, dominating both domestic and international markets and offering a comprehensive platform to build a strong digital reputation. Conversely, Lyft’s localized presence prompts users to diversify their ride-sharing preferences.Most recently, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives likened Lyft’s new management’s challenge to climbing Mount Everest, pointing out the monumental effort required to revamp the company’s business model. Tipranks analysts point to downside of roughly 3% from current price levels.Story continuesFrontier Group Holdings (ULCC)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comFrontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ:ULCC), the parent company of Frontier Airlines, has failed to deliver the goods for its shareholders, unlike its peers. It faces multiple challenges, including a potential dip in flight demand and subpar customer ratings.Echoing this sentiment, InvestorPlace’s own Larry Ramer narrates a personal experience with Frontier, underscoring an 8.5-hour flight delay bereft of compensation. His account is a testament to the airline’s low consumer ratings on platforms like TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and its glaring operational and customer service deficiencies.The company’s profitability situation is alarming, with core metrics firmly in the red. For instance, free cash flow and net income margins stand at a negative 2.7% and 2%, respectively, significantly behind sector averages.TripAdvisor (TRIP)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comTripAdvisor is a renowned global travel guidance provider, which is currently in turbulent waters as it grapples with the harsh realities of shrinking margins. Over the past decade, its competitive foothold in its core markets has dwindled. This is due to growing competition and the noticeable scarcity of lucrative monetization opportunities.This stark reality is that online travel agents continue to outstrip Tripadvisor’s growth with their specialized product range.TripAdvisor’s first-quarter results cast a shadow over its future prospects, revealing a 5% year-over-year increase in selling and marketing costs, accounting for a hefty 59% of total revenue. Management attributes the surge to climbing costs in paid online traffic acquisition and a sizeable uptick in marketing spend. Moreover, the financial analysis platform GuruFocus assigns a meager 2/10 growth rank on the company, emphasizing the company’s underwhelming historical performance and tepid liquidity metrics.Carnival Corporation (CCL)Carnival (CCL) cruise ship on water in front of beach with chairsSource: FlickrCruise line behemoth Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) has been charting a strong recovery course, surging more than 100% since the start of the year. Evidently, 2023 has ushered in a sea change for its business, as pandemic-led fears have substantially diminished. The ripple effect of this positive shift is evident in the company’s first-quarter results, where net revenue yields rose over the 2019 numbers, registering a favorable cash inflow from operations.Yet, stormy waters are on the horizon. The firm forecast a per-share loss ranging from 8 to 20 cents for the year. Adding to these woes, Carnival’s debt load has ballooned over three times in just half a decade, a massive burden exacerbated by escalating interest rates. Additionally, despite its soaring performance, Carnival dampened investor spirits with a late-June announcement anticipating reduced profits in the current third quarter.InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG)InterContinental Hotels (IHG) sign on a hotelSource: Cineberg/Shutterstock.comInterContinental Hotel Group (NYSE:IHG) has been witnessing an uneven recovery, with a pronounced rebound in RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) in Greater China, contrasting with a rather tepid response in the Americas. Nevertheless, the firm holds the potential to navigate the rising tide of inflation effectively, effectively catering to budget-conscious customers.To be fair, its financials are in excellent shape and the company seems to be doing well with respect to navigating current market headwinds. However, its stock price seems divorced from its fundamentals at this point, with its price-to-sales ratio of 5.6-times forward estimates roughly 540% higher than its sector median. Moreover, it’s trading at an eye-watering 32-times forward cash flow estimates.Hence, a cautionary note is pertinent with IHG stock, despite the company’s promising recovery in certain regions.Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) continues to be a robust performer, with a notable 38% year-to-date share gain, sailing well ahead of the broader market in terms of performance. The online travel agency’s first-quarter results indicate an impressive trajectory, boasting a 38.3% year-over-year jump in booked room nights and a remarkable upsurge in gross bookings. Moreover, the company’s surge in earnings per share, to $11.60 from $3.90 per share in the prior-year quarter, underscores the company’s current winning streak.However, the future looks a bit dodgy for Booking Holdings. Analysts anticipate a slackening pace in the company’s growth rate, projecting a 21.1% revenue increase this year. While decent, that represents a significant slowdown from the phenomenal 56% growth rate seen in 2022. Additionally, a further drop is expected, with revenue likely to increase only 10.6% next year. Moreover, its earnings are likely to follow a similar trend, which should weigh down its stock, which trades at a nosebleed valuation.Mesa Air Group (MESA)a jet takes off on a clear runway.Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.comMesa Air Group (NASDAQ:MESA) presents a precarious investment option, as the company grapples with many operational challenges and deals with financial strain. Moreover, its historical financials have been far from rosy, with GuruFocus assigning a growth and financial strength rank of just 1/10 and 3/10, respectively.A key issue with this company lies in pilot shortages. Now, this is a problem that’s been attributed to retirements and attrition to larger airlines. However, this problem has severely impacted Mesa’s ability to fulfill contracted schedules, leading to massive losses.While a recent partnership with United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) and a significant increase in pilot pay appear promising, its path to recovery is uncertain. Additionally, the United Airlines contract is smaller in scope than the terminated American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)  one, and a possible softening of eCommerce could impact their DHL operations. The company’s massive liabilities, which total more than $700 million, loom large against a cash reserve of just $51 million.Hertz Global (HTZ)Hertz (HTZ) sign in Montevrain, France on May 8, 2016.Source: aureliefrance / Shutterstock.comA glance at Hertz Global’s (NASDAQ:HTZ) post-bankruptcy journey draws an intriguing picture. The firm, famous for renting and leasing cars, took its bankruptcy turbulence in stride, emerging as a leaner and more robust business. The struggle prompted a necessary restructuring, marked by fierce cost-cutting initiatives that continue to bear fruit for its business and offer tremendous upside ahead.Furthermore, The Federal Reserve continues its relentless pursuit of higher interest rates, with further hikes looming. Meanwhile, economists murmur about a potential recession, an event that could see a downturn in non-essential expenditures. Travel falls into this category, weakening demand for rental cars and leased fleets. With this economic backdrop, it’s worth approaching Hertz Global cautiously, despite its recent resurgence.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

(Photo: Teamsters)Teamsters President Sean O’ Brien lashed out Saturday at critics who say the union’s hard line in contract negotiations with UPS Inc. will push the economy into a recession, saying the burden of keeping the country out of a downturn falls on UPS, not the Teamsters.At a raucous, ear-splitting rally in UPS’ hometown of Atlanta, O’Brien acknowledged concerns that a strike against UPS (NYSE: UPS), which delivers the equivalent of 7% of the U.S.’ gross domestic product per day, could be devastating to the economy. “But that’s on UPS, not us.”By not agreeing to a fair contract with the Teamsters, “UPS is going to throw this country into recession,” O’Brien said.UPS TEAMSTERS ROLL DEEP IN ATLANTARank-and-file @UPS #Teamsters led the charge this morning in the home city of the multibillion-dollar corporation’s headquarters as Teamsters General President Sean M.

Talks stalled July 5 after UPS, according to the Teamsters, failed to meet the union’s demands on wage and benefit increases for part-time workers.The current five-year contract expires July 31. The Teamsters have threatened to strike Aug. 1 if a tentative contract is not agreed to by its negotiating committee by July 31. It is expected to take about three weeks for the 340,000 rank-and-file members to review and either ratify or reject the tentative agreement.Story continuesRead more: 5 things to know with the UPS-Teamsters clock tickingThe post Teamsters rally in Atlanta ahead of UPS negotiations appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Procter &amp; Gamble is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$19b ÷ (US$120b - US$38b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Procter &amp; Gamble compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Procter &amp; Gamble here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsProcter &amp; Gamble is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 47% over the last five years.

(NASDAQ:AAL) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 20, 2023American Airlines Group Inc. beats earnings expectations.

These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items.

The information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.Robert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The summer is well underway, and the American Airlines team is firing on all cylinders. We continue to build on the strong foundation we have laid over the past year and remain focused on reliability, profitability, accountability and strengthening our balance sheet. That focus is showing up in our results. Everything we have said we would do at the start of the year, we have done. Our operation is performing at historically strong levels. And this morning, we reported adjusted pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.8 billion for the second quarter. These earnings were well above the high end of our latest EPS guidance range, marking our fifth consecutive quarterly profit.At the start of the recovery, we told you that returning to profitability hinged on running a reliable airline. American continues to run a strong operation in an evolving environment in which we are very well positioned because of the hard work our team has done in recent years. Our sustained profitability is tied to our leading network rewards program and operation. We have a tremendous network and we operate in a reliable and efficient way, and we reward our customers for using it. Now, let's talk more about our financial results. We produced total revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. This was driven by broad-based demand across all entities with a particular strength in demand for international travel leading into the summer.plane, fly, america, take, travel, strip, 737, airbus, jet, departure, delta, editorial, technology, paradise, transport, airborne, airplane, regional, transportation, tourism,Pixabay/Public DomainThroughout the recovery, we have made structural changes to enhance our customers' travel experiences and position the airline for success. We have simplified and harmonized our fleet to create a more nimble and more flexible network that is focused on our most profitable flying. American strength is our network, which is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the demographic changes in the U.S. More people have moved to the Sunbelt region, which is where some of our largest hubs are located. DFW, Charlotte, Miami and Phoenix are very well positioned now and for the future. Our strong regional network provides service to smaller towns and connect them with our hubs across the country, and our global partnerships are a great complement to our own flying.As a result, we are able to offer customers the most comprehensive network of any U.S. carrier. We continue to adapt our offerings to our customers' evolving preferences. We are taking customers to where they want to go and meeting them where they want to do business. We are servicing more of our customers through our direct channels and driving engagement in our advantage program and credit card portfolio. Our Travel Rewards program is the largest among the U.S. network carriers, and it continues to grow. We are making terrific progress in training our pilots and improving the utilization of both our mainline and regional fleet. Our young fleet and low near-term CapEx requirements enable us to generate free cash flow to reinvest in the business and strengthen our balance sheet.Now turning to the operations. The American Airlines team has delivered strong operational results over the past year, and it continued as we achieved record second quarter completion factor. We operated nearly 0.5 million flights in the quarter with an average load factor of approximately 86%. In the second quarter, we also delivered 11 more combined zero canceled days in the same period of a year ago. The summer peak started strong with our team delivering our record Memorial Day weekend mainline completion factor while operating our largest mainline Memorial Day weekend schedule ever. The momentum has continued into July. We delivered the best Independence Day holiday operation in our history, with traffic levels we haven't seen since July of 2019.At American, we're focused on taking care of what we can control. Our purposeful approach to planning, along with our investments in our team, fleet and technology has set us up for success during the busy summer travel season and beyond. And now I'll hand it over to Devon who will share more about our second quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.Devon May: Thank you, Robert. The focus and dedication of the American Airlines team has resulted in strong operational performance which is helping to produce solid financial results. Once again, we delivered on our guidance for the second quarter. Excluding net special items, we reported second quarter net income of $1.4 billion or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92. Our strong operational performance resulted in slightly higher capacity production for the quarter and CASM ex performance better than the midpoint of our forecast. Unit revenues remained strong, resulting in an operating margin and EPS that outperformed the high end of our guidance provided in May. As Robert mentioned, American produced record revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year.This revenue performance led to our highest ever adjusted operating income of $2.2 billion resulting in a second quarter adjusted operating margin of 15.4%. Unit revenue in the quarter was down just 0.5% versus a historically strong 2022 on 5.3% more capacity. Domestic unit revenue was down 1.9%, while international unit revenue was up 18.3% year-over-year. Our unit cost for the quarter, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 3.7% year-over-year. That's better than the midpoint of our initial guidance range due to slightly higher than planned capacity production driven by our strong operational performance. I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our fleet. Our young and simplified fleet differentiates American from our U.S. network peers and provides network flexibility, enhanced efficiency and an improved customer experience.These benefits are the result of the refleeting we pursued from 2014 to 2019 and accelerated during the pandemic. We are pleased we built our fleet in a low interest rate environment and at a time when the supply chain wasn't as challenged as it is today. In 2023, we expect to take delivery of 23 new mainline aircraft which are all now financed. We took 13 deliveries in the first half of the year and expect 10 more aircraft to be delivered by year-end. For our regional fleet, this quarter, we entered into agreements to purchase seven new Embraer 175 aircraft and seven used Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft that will be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of this year. We're excited to have these aircraft into service and to further bolster our regional connectivity.Based on the latest delivery guidance from Boeing and Airbus, along with our new and used regional aircraft purchase commitments, our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. Our non-aircraft CapEx is still expected to be approximately $800 million. We anticipate our 2024 total CapEx to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Looking beyond 2024, we continually review our medium and long-term fleet plans. Due to the young age of our aircraft, our fleet replacement needs are very limited. Therefore, we expect aircraft CapEx for the next several years and likely through the end of the decade to average approximately $3.5 billion per year. Moving to the balance sheet. Yesterday, Fitch upgraded Americans credit rating.This is the first step towards our goal of BB credit metrics by the end of 2025, and it's nice to see our progress being recognized. We continue to maintain strong liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $1.8 billion. Our adjusted net investing cash flow was approximately $550 million, resulting in quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We have produced $4.3 billion of free cash flow in the first six months of the year and expect full year free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the second quarter with approximately $14.9 billion of total available liquidity. We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet in the second quarter by reducing total debt by $387 million. This debt reduction, combined with the improvement in liquidity resulted in a decrease in net debt of approximately $955 million during the second quarter.We have now reduced total debt by approximately $9.4 billion from peak debt levels in 2021, which is significant progress towards our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. By the end of 2023, we expect our total debt to be approximately $11 billion lower than peak debt levels in 2021. Importantly, we ended the second quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8 times, which is lower than it was at the end of 2019. Now turning to our guidance. Bookings remain strong, and we continue to see a constructive demand environment. We saw record revenue for the 4th of July holiday period and booked load factors for the third quarter are in line with what we saw in 2022. International entities continue to lead the way in terms of year-over-year performance, and we are encouraged by domestic business demand, notably from small- and medium-sized enterprises.As the recovery continues to unfold, the strong unit revenue environment in 2022 represents an increasingly difficult comparison. As a result, we expect third quarter TRASM to be down 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year on 5% to 7% more capacity. We expect third quarter CASM-ex to be up 2% to 4% year-over-year. Our current forecast for the third quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.55 and $2.65 per gallon. Based on our current demand and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce and adjusted operating margin of between 8% and 10% in the third quarter and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $0.85 and $0.95, excluding special items. For the full year, we continue to expect to produce capacity that is 5% to 8% higher than 2022. Our full year forecast for unit revenue continues to be up low single digits year-over-year.We now expect our full year CASM-ex to be up 2% to 4% versus 2022. Notably, our expectations for capacity TRASM and CASM-ex are all consistent with the initial guidance we provided on our January earnings call. That said, our estimate for full year fuel expense has changed. We now expect to pay between $2.70 and $2. 80 per gallon, a reduction from our initial guidance. The full year update further highlights the positive environment we are operating in. Based on our demand and fuel cost assumptions, we expect to produce a full year adjusted operating margin of between 8% and 10% and adjusted EPS of between $3 and $3.75. We are very proud of the progress the American Airlines team has made, but we believe there is more opportunity ahead of us.We will continue to focus on delivering in 2023 and unlocking even more value in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.Robert Isom: Thanks, Devon. The American Airlines team is delivering on our commitments. We're on track to deliver on the full year guidance we provided back in January, driving earnings growth, record free cash flow, meaningful debt reduction and importantly, a strong and reliable operation. We are executing on that plan. We are reliable, profitable and making tremendous progress strengthening our balance sheet and I know that our team will continue to deliver. We're excited to share more about our long-term strategy at an Investor Day later this year on our Fort Worth campus. We look forward to updating you on the business and sharing more about our longer-term strategic priorities at that time. We're incredibly excited about the future of American and can't wait to tell you more.

70,39f82ca5-806c-3d3d-bf0f-12df79486176,SHW,2023-07-23,Is It Time To Consider Buying The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-sherwin-williams-120050968.html,1690113650,STORY,['SHW'],"[Let's talk about the popular The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams What Is Sherwin-Williams Worth?The stock is currently trading at US$269 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 30% compared to my intrinsic value of $206.10. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Sherwin-Williams’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Sherwin-Williams look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 22% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sherwin-Williams. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in SHW’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe SHW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SHW for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for SHW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Sherwin-Williams, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

74,67fce195-4c25-36c7-bcce-d43f1ff3940b,REGN,2023-07-23,"Is Weakness In Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-140019240.html,1690034419,STORY,['REGN'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.3% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:18% = US$4.2b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a decent ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 23%. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 27% net income growth reported by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesNext, on comparing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 32% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is REGN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.
