To see more such stocks, go to 5 Bank Stocks With Insider Buying and Selling Last Week.The collapse of the Silicon Valley bank sent tremors throughout the global financial system. As of March 15 morning, European banks were starting to feel the heat, with Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) losing almost a quarter of its value after the Swiss bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, categorically announced that it cannot provide more financial assistance to the bank.The Federal Reserve Running Out of OptionsSeveral bank stocks which rose after the US government’s quick intervention to stop the spillover of the current crisis were falling on Wednesday morning. The recent crisis has created a new problem for the Federal Reserve, which was on its path of monetary tightening to quell inflation. However, several analysts are now seeing the Federal Reserve hitting brakes on its rate-hike spree, with some even expecting rate cuts. While the Federal Reserve wants to control inflation, it does not want the financial system to break down in the process.Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe the Federal Reserve will not announce any new interest rate hikes at its upcoming meeting, as the firm sees “considerable uncertainty” about the Fed’s roadmap.Should You Buy the ""Incredible Bargain"" In Bank Stocks?But some believe the government will be able to control the crisis. Bill Ackman of Pershing Square on March 13 wrote in a tweet that he believes regional bank stocks are an “incredible bargain now as long as the gov’t does the right thing, and I am confident it will.” Ackman has been vehemently calling for a government guarantee on deposits to increase consumer confidence.  Here is what Ackman said in his tweet about regional bank stocks:“This means that one of the great trades would be to buy regional bank stocks or ETFs here. And the massive decline in rates makes this an even better investment now. This is not without real risk, but it does offer very attractive asymmetry. I would be surprised if Warren isn’t putting capital to work in his favorite regional banks now. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to participate as we decided that we wouldn’t invest long or short in banks as I want to continue to be part of this conversation and be able to share my views without the typical accusations against investors who share their views while having a trade on.”Story continuesBank Stocks With Insider Buying and Selling Last WeekLuis Louro / shutterstock.comIs the Current Turmoil an Overreaction?Wells Fargo analyst Jared Shaw said in a note to investors that the selloff in the banking sector was “an overreaction to fears of a potential bank run, as the space is well-capitalized.” The analyst thinks banks have “significant sources of additional liquidity.” Shaw thinks that “challenges from rates” will have an earnings impact for banks but they do not pose an “existential crisis” to these companies. The analyst said he does not think that depositors should lose confidence. At Morgan Stanley, analyst Manan Gosalia called the Silicon Valley bank problems as ""highly idiosyncratic.” The analyst said the problem of the collapsed bank should not be “read-across to other banks we cover.”The analyst said that the reason why investors are worried right now is their concerns about liquidity in the sector. On that front, the analyst added:""We want to be very clear here... we do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.""Another comment to calm investors’ nerves came from BofA Securities analyst Ebrahim Poonawala who believes investors are extrapolating issues peculiar to some banks in the sector.Despite these optimistic comments, investors will continue to watch bank stocks like Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS),  Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) closely in the coming weeks.Why Is It Important to Look at Insider Buying and Selling Activity?Amid the latest banking crisis, investors and analysts have been watching insider buying and selling activity at regional banks, as these transactions often point to management’s confidence in their company, or lack thereof. For example, CNBC recently revealed in a report that Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker sold about $30 million worth of stock over the past two years.  What’s more concerning is that the executive sold a whopping $3.6 million worth of SVB shares on February 27, just a few days before the bank reported a loss that led to events causing its collapse. That’s why it’s important to keep an eye on insider buying and selling activity and that’s what we are going to do in this article.For this article we used Insider Monkey’s database of insider buying and selling activity and picked 11 bank stocks with insider buying and selling transactions during the seven-day period ending March 14.

Start your free 7-day trial to get this news first.Charles Schwab upgraded at Credit SuisseCredit Suisse upgraded Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to Outperform from Neutral while cutting its price target to $67.50 from $81.50, noting it anticipates continued client sorting, but the risks appear manageable and nearing their peak based on current forward curves.“Central risk to the upgrade would be a significant shift in forward curve expectations – overly hawkish backdrop will keep alive client sorting while overly dovish landscape will ignite peak of cycle EPS worries and raise rotation risk,” said the firm, adding that other potential risks include high consensus EPS expectations and adverse regulatory changes.Shares rose more than 4% premarket today following a 9% gain yesterday.Reinsurance Group of America double upgraded to Buy Citi upgraded Reinsurance Group of America (NYSE:RGA) to Buy from Sell with a price target of $158.00, noting it is incrementally positive on growth in the US and Asia after sitting with CFO Todd Larson.The firm’s prior views on earnings volatility and pandemic uncertainty have changed, with natural maturation in the US no longer a subject and an energetic management team.The firm anticipates continued benefits from cession rates and pricing tailwinds as RGA adjusts for higher mortality experience. They are confident that incoming CEO Tony Cheng's track record of growing the Asian segment, where returns are higher than in the US, will further strengthen RGA's growth trajectory. “On top of this, RGA has no equity market exposure and lower allocations to structured securities vs. the backdrop of macro uncertainty for peers,” added the firm.3 more upgradesCiti upgraded Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $53.00 from $49.00. Shares were up more than 2% premarket today following an 8% gain yesterday.Story continuesThe firm strongly recommends the stock due to (1) its Group Benefits business, which has a capital-efficient core and is experiencing remarkable growth due to unique digital offerings, (2) its cash flow profile that is getting better as a result of actions taken to hedge long-term-care (LTC) cash flows and accelerated regulatory reserve additions, and (3) negligible exposure to equity markets and structured securities such as CLOs and CMBS.JPMorgan upgraded MPLX (NYSE:MPLX) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $41.00 from $37.00.“Underpinned by a diverse asset footprint and meaningful refined refinery logistics stability, MPLX continues to demonstrate strong operational performance, including asset and cost optimizations,” said the firm.Like other companies in the refined pipeline product sector, MPLX is well-placed to take advantage of margin expansions resulting from inflation escalators that lift tariffs more than the realized cost increases, said the firm.Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR) shares closed nearly 4% higher yesterday after BofA Securities upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $52.00 from $42.00.Related Articles5 big analyst picks: Charles Schwab stock called a buy | Pro RecapCredit Suisse leads Europe bank stock rout after short-lived SVB respiteUS Senators Menendez, Warren urge regulators to support new gun sale code]"

Schwab shares, however, are down 25.6% from their close last Wednesday, the day before many bank shares began a downward spiral in reaction to problems at Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was shut down by regulators on Friday.About 82% of deposits held by Schwab were insured, falling under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's limit of $250,000.The bank has ""access to significant liquidity"" including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, plus new assets.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen and Nupur Anand; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Leslie Adler)]"

We've got four names for you up on the board, Lennar, Freshpet, Guess, and First Republic Bank.Kicking it off with Lennar. Looking at gains of just about 3% in extended trading. This move has to do with the guidance that we just got out here from the homebuilder. They boosted their delivery guidance for the second quarter and also for the full year. The Street obviously very excited about that.EPS, their profit also coming in better than expected. So we're looking at gains of just about 3%.Moving on to Freshpet. A bit of a different story here with the stock off nearly 10% in extended trading. Some the headlines here crossing that the company is now looking to raise some financing, announcing $350 million in convertible notes-- senior note offerings here for the company as it does look to tap some financing. So we're looking at losses of nearly 10%.When you take a look at the longer-term chart of Freshpet, if we can flip over to that, year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 5%. Over the last year, though, the stock off just about 34%.Let's take a look at Guess. That stock off just about 8% in extended trading. The retailer disappointing the Street. Adjusted EPS, it did beat, but this was all about the guidance. The guidance missing expectations. They do see 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.46 to $2.80. Well, the Street was looking for $3.55, so coming up very short there.Over the past year, we're looking at gains of just about 22%. Year to date since January 1, just barely in the green.Now let's take a look at First Republic Bank. This stock, of course, has been on our radar now for a number of days in extended trading. We're looking at a pop of just about 12%, adding to the gains that we saw intraday. Although the gains that we are seeing that we did see today coming after a massive drop here in the stock. Intraday closing up just about 26%.Story continuesBut if you look at a five-day chart, the shares are still down about 65%. First Republic Bank one of the regional banks that have been caught up in the aftermath, some of the selling that we have seen within this industry following the collapse of silver bank-- Silicon Valley Bank, excuse me, on Friday and then also Silvergate over the weekend.Charles Schwab, that stock up just about 3/10 of a percent, and Zions, that stock up just about 2%.

10,779b8894-5166-319d-9094-98cf8ccba948,TXN,2023-03-15,Web of Secret Chip Deals Allegedly Help US Tech Flow to Russia,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/secret-chip-deals-allegedly-help-040134984.html,1678852894,STORY,"['ADI', 'TXN', 'MCHP', 'AVGO']","[(Bloomberg) -- For years, Artem Uss had appeared in Russian media as the owner of fancy real estate, luxury cars and Italian hotels. Now US officials allege he’s at the center of a suspected secret supply chain that prosecutors say used American technology to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.Most Read from BloombergUBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3.3 Billion Deal to End CrisisCredit Suisse’s $17 Billion of Risky Bonds Are Now WorthlessWarren Buffett in Contact With Biden Team on Banking CrisisCredit Suisse Said to Push Back Against UBS’s $1 Billion OfferFed and Global Central Banks Move to Boost Dollar FundingThe son of a Siberian governor was arrested last year on charges that he and his associates defrauded the US and its companies and also violated sanctions by selling sensitive technologies from the US to Russia via intermediaries in non-sanctioned countries. He’s the most politically connected Russian to be indicted by the US as Washington races to choke off Moscow’s access to chips used in weapons systems. Uss has denied any wrongdoing and is now in the midst of an extradition battle in Milan.Court documents from the Uss case and others like it show how Russia allegedly built a secret pipeline for years before the war to ensure the supply of semiconductors to the country despite US controls. Those well-honed tactics are now helping Russian operators rebuild dismantled networks and deceive publicly listed US tech companies, according to customs data, indictments and people familiar with the matter, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media.American prosecutors haven’t identified the semiconductor manufacturers who may have sold to Uss’s team unwittingly, and he is now under house arrest in Milan. Even so, US and EU officials say that Russia is still able to get chips and technology for military use through other networks. Customs data analyzed by the British think tank Royal United Services Institute and seen by Bloomberg also show that semiconductors made by large companies including Analog Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Microchip Technology Inc. have been getting to Russia via third-party firms in other parts of the world for months after the war started. The companies say they follow the law, don’t sell to Russia and they haven’t authorized the sale of their products there.Story continues“We should be assuming that much of our sensitive technologies are making their way into the wrong hands,” said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner and chair of the national security practice at Washington-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, who served as a senior official at the US Department of Commerce. “The third-party intermediary problem is a fairly easy and significant loophole.”For more, read: Russia Is Getting Round Sanctions to Buy Key Chips for Its WarUss and his associates allegedly operated before and after the invasion, according to a US indictment. Prosecutors say they set up small shell companies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia — essentially Trojan horses to convince chip-makers in California, Pennsylvania and New York that they were selling to non-sanctioned jurisdictions.They fabricated certificates that falsified the end user, the charges allege. One front company they set up in Malaysia had several addresses, but only one had a visible sign and even that was located in an empty room in a strip mall, the prosecutors allege. The items were ultimately sent to customers in Russia, including US-sanctioned defense contractors, the indictment says.The same indictment also accuses Uss’s team of simultaneously profiting by selling sanctioned Venezuelan oil. The Russian defendants are also charged with defrauding US banks.Uss, 40, says he didn’t do anything wrong, isn’t responsible for anything his associates may have allegedly done, and argues that he shouldn’t be extradited because he risks being treated unfairly in the US, people familiar with his legal defense say, declining to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. Dressed in a dark gray suit as he left his closed door hearing in Milan in February, he declined to comment. His lawyers also declined to answer questions.The US has had restrictions on Russian purchases of military-related technology for years, but it’s been sharply accelerating those controls since Putin invaded Ukraine in February last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia doesn’t consider the restrictions placed by US “legal from the point of view of international law.”“Sanctions are what has been decided on by the UN Security Council — these are nothing more than unilateral, illegal restrictions,” Peskov said.Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important to the outcome of the war. Russia has been ramping up its push to get chips, suggesting its stockpiles aren’t deep enough and Moscow’s efforts are unlikely to have resolved shortages, said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.Ukraine’s government has publicly urged tech giants including Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. to stop making microchips that it says support Russia’s Glonass satellite navigation system. Representatives at Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment.Analog Devices in a statement said that any post-sanctions shipments into Russia, the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine and Belarus is a direct violation of its policies “and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products.” The company has ramped up monitoring of gray market activities, it said.Microchip also said in a statement that it doesn’t sell to sanctioned regions and works on screening customers.“We do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren’t designed for,” Texas Instruments said in a statement, adding that it doesn’t sell into Russia or Belarus.In addition to Uss, the US charged six other individuals in October, including Yury Orekhov, whom it identified as a former employee at a Russian aluminum firm. Lawyers for Orekhov didn’t respond to a request for comment.The team “engaged in a variety of activities in violation of US laws and regulations sanctions, including the unlawful export of millions of US dollars in military and sensitive dual-use technologies from the United States to Russia, and the use of the US financial system to smuggle millions of barrels of embargoed oil from Venezuela,” the charges said.In a press release, the US Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, which filed the charges, said this alleged network “schemed to procure sophisticated technology in direct support of a floundering Russian Federation military industrial complex.”They used fake purchase orders, business records and shipping documents to fool American chipmakers, the court documents allege. All that helped mask the end user: The Russian military, according to prosecutors. Illicit deliveries continued after Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022 attack on Ukraine, at least until the end of March that year, prosecutors said. Components made by several of the US companies were found in seized Russian weapons platforms in Ukraine, the charges said.At other times, Uss’s associates falsely told US chipmakers that their products were headed to Roscosmos, the Russian space program that still has cooperative agreements with NASA, according to the charges. A spokesperson at NASA declined to comment.Orekhov shuttled between Germany and Dubai, where he had a property on the pricey artificial island of Palm Jumeirah, according to US prosecutors. He relied on companies based in the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Russia and Malaysia, the indictment said.Both Uss and Orekhov got involved in the scheme after the US blacklisted another co-defendant Timofey Telegin and his defense contracting firm in 2018, court documents allege. Telegin had come under scrutiny after two of his employees were detained in the US on charges of trying to illegally acquire sensitive military technology two years earlier, according to court documents. No lawyers for Telegin have filed public notices of appearances and he couldn't be reached for comment about the case.Russia is constantly seeking new loopholes as US pressure builds, according to Adam Smith, a former top Treasury official who worked on Russia sanctions policy and is now at the law firm Gibson Dunn. “There are perhaps two hundred other jurisdictions they could potentially leverage.”The analysis by the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, showed that nearly all the American semiconductors that reached Russia in recent customs data were bought by companies in China and eventually reached the manufacturer of Russia’s Orlan-10 drones.Biden officials have raised concerns about Russia’s access to chips with other countries, including China and the UAE, according to people with knowledge of the conversations, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media. A spokesperson at the Department of Commerce said the US will continue to communicate with other countries about its controls, monitor developments and “act as appropriate to deny Russia the items it needs to sustain its war machine.”Unlike the EU and US, China and the UAE don’t have sanctions on Russia.“The UAE adheres to, and strictly enforces, international laws and UN mandated sanctions, alongside agreements established with international partners, including the US,” a UAE official said in a statement to Bloomberg. The Middle Eastern country says it has systems in place to monitor illicit fund flows and has put in sophisticated customs systems to monitor products, including sensitive technologies.China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it isn’t aware of the details surrounding the chips issue and its stance is to promote peace and talks in Ukraine. The US has frequently spread false information on the subject of China’s relations with Russia, it said.US and EU officials have said that Russia also continues to access foreign chips and technology through intermediaries like Iran, Turkey, the UAE and Kazakhstan.The US in February sanctioned a Swiss-Italian businessman, accusing him and his associates of using companies in the UAE, Switzerland, Malta and Bulgaria for acquiring sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russia intelligence and military.In Italy, meanwhile, Uss remains under house arrest. He faces up to 30 years in a US prison if extradited. The Milan tribunal is yet to rule on the US extradition request.The indictment says that Uss’s alleged involvement in the chips smuggling started in 2018, the same year his father secured election as governor of the resource-rich Krasnoyarsk region.On social media, Uss’s father, Alexander, who is a member of the ruling party, has denounced the case against his son as fabricated by the US. “The political nature of these accusations is obvious,” he said in a Telegram post.The US sanctioned both father and son in December. Alexander Uss didn’t respond to requests for comment submitted via his press service.Russia, meanwhile, has put the younger Uss on a wanted list for alleged money-laundering and is asking for his handover. Uss in mid-January asked the Milan court hearing his extradition case to send him instead to Russia to face charges, the Russian state news service Tass reported.Although the US said in June last year that Russian semiconductor imports were slashed by 90% because of its curbs, the US industry association warned in January of the “broad challenges in preventing the illicit purchase and counterfeiting” of American chips.Read more: Putin Stirs EU Worry on Home Appliance Imports Stripped for ArmsAlso frustrating US efforts to limit the trade, Moscow has switched its focus to acquiring less advanced consumer-grade components that are easier to procure, Bloomberg News has reported.“This is ultimately a contest of wills,” said James Byrne, an expert in technology and security at RUSI. “The Russians need this, it’s critical to their military program, so they have to acquire it. They’ll go to great lengths for that.”--With assistance from Jillian Deutsch and Eric Martin.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhonesTrump’s Tariffs Couldn’t Save the California Olive IndustryPumping Heat a Mile Underground Is Helping One City Cut CarbonBrazil’s Surprise Oil Tax Puts $20 Billion in Investment at Risk©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This marks a significant step toward ramping up Oyu Tolgoi to become one of the world’s leading copper suppliers.Rio Tinto received a 66% direct interest in the world-class Oyu Tolgoi mine following the completion of its acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd for approximately $3.1 billion in December 2022. The remaining 34% stake in the Oyu Tolgoi project is held by the government of Mongolia.Since January 2023, RIO has been working directly with the government of Mongolia to expedite the Oyu Tolgoi project. So far, 30 draw bells have been blasted and the ore is currently being processed from Panel Zero in Hugo North Lift 1.Developing the underground mine calls for an investment of more than $7 billion. Production will ramp up over the coming years and Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce around 500,000 tons of copper annually from 2028 to 2036 from the open pit and underground. This will likely help produce around 6 million electric vehicles in a year.By 2030, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to become the fourth-largest copper mine in the world, operating in the first quartile of the copper equivalent cost curve. This project will aid Rio Tinto in capitalizing on the growing demand for copper. Copper prices have been impacted in 2022 by heightened concerns over a global economic slowdown and the resurgent COVID restrictions in China, which is the top consumer of the metal. However, prices are regaining ground lately fueled by worries about low supply from South America amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand in China.The long-term outlook for copper remains positive as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles, renewable energy and infrastructure investments. However, grade decline, rising input costs, water constraints and scarcity of high-quality developmental opportunities continue to disrupt the industry's supply. This demand-supply imbalance will support copper prices in the future.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of Rio Tinto have fallen 14% compared with the industry’s 17.1% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderRio Tinto currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

LYB and renewable energy producer Grenergy recently signed five long-term solar power purchase agreements (PPAs). Under the 15-year contracts, Spain-based Grenergy will supply solar energy from the La Cereal solar farm project, which is slated to be operational by the end of 2025. The agreements represent around 329,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of solar power annually, equivalent to more than 90,000 European homes' annual electricity consumption.LyondellBasell has accomplished 70% of its goal to get at least 50% of its power from renewable sources by 2030 through these agreements. More than 2.9 million MWh of renewable electricity will be delivered by the company's PPA portfolio, and its scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions will be lowered by more than a million tons. These agreements reflect LyondellBasell's progression toward its commitment to minimize its scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030 and approach net zero by 2050.The funding of Grenergy's largest project to date in Spain will be optimized with the aid of this PPA. The Clara Campoamor photovoltaic solar energy project, which Grenergy is developing between Madrid and Castilla La Mancha, incorporates the 259 megawatts (MW) La Cereal solar farm project.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings.

The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc.

We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $5.4 billion.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

(NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 1.11%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is next on our list of the best dividend-paying stocks to buy now. The American private banking company was a part of 97 hedge fund portfolios in Q4 2022, up from 90 in the previous quarter, as tracked by Insider Monkey. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $7.8 billion.S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.11%, as of March 14. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for 50 years now.Argus raised its price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 in February and maintained a Buy rating on the shares, appreciating the company's outperformance relative to its peers.In the fourth quarter of 2022, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) reported revenue of $3 billion, up 40.7% from the same period last year. The company remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning approximately $1 billion to investors in dividends in FY22.Andvari Associated mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

For more bank stocks, head on over to 5 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds. These days, anything that anyone can talk about in the finance industry is the collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB). SVB's fate is closely tied to the current situation of the American economy, and before we get to that, it's better to first take a primer on the current situation.For the banking and stock markets, along with the corporate world in general, the main topic of discussion for the past twelve months now is the Federal Reserve Bank. Known as the Fed, the central bank is responsible for defending the U.S. dollar's purchasing power against inflationary pressures, and after it reduced interest rates to a record low due to the coronavirus pandemic, it has spent the past year in course correction to bring down inflation. This has seen the Fed hike interest rates by a massive 4.25 percentage points since March 16 last year, as it aims to reduce the demand for capital in the market and control the flow of currency to bring down goods and services prices as a consequence.However, these are not the only consequences of the monetary policy shifts. Another direct result of rising interest rates comes in the form of higher bond yields. For the uninitiated, a bond's yield is its interest payment divided by its price (the interest rate is fixed). So, since the interest payment is fixed for previously issued bonds, if the Fed raises interest rates, the prices of the low rate bonds fall in the market and their yields start to rise. This dynamic sits at the heart of the SVB collapse, as the bank had heavily bought these bonds during the coronavirus pandemic when interest rates were low. What made it buy these bonds? Well, back then, the bank's deposits had soared to a whopping $124 billion from an earlier $62 billion, at a pace that saw it beat much larger rivals such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as SVB's client based, mostly consisting of the technology industry, saw its fortunes rise with the technology sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesThis large deposit base was made up of unstable money that belonged to companies and venture capital firms - both of which could withdraw it at a moment's notice and leave SVB without adequate funds to cover its obligations. Since these deposits accrued faster than the bank's customers required money, SVB had to invest them into securities. This investment decision is at the heart of its collapse and the impact of the Fed's rate hike induced yield spiral. At this point in the decision making cycle, banks can choose to either invest the funds into available for sale or held to maturity securities. The former enables the bank to quickly recover the money without taking losses, but the latter requires it to take a haircut if the bonds are sold before their maturity date - a fact that bit SVB hard when the interest rate hike drove down the prices of older bonds since between 2019 and today, while its available for sale portfolio grew by 93%, its held to maturity portfolio grew by a stunning 607%! At the same time, the bank's balance sheet at the end of December 2022 revealed that $86 billion of its $91 billion HTM securities were expected to mature after ten years. Out of these $ 91 billion dollars of HTM securities, the bank booked an unbelievable $15.160 billion in unrealized losses in its last fiscal year. These losses shocked the market when SVB announced that it would sell $2.5 billion in shares to help buffer them, sending its shares tumbling by 60%.Yet, still, for those unfamiliar with banking regulations, the impact of all this will be lost at this point. To ensure that banks do not become insolvent after booking these losses, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) requires banks to hold core capital that consisted primarily of its own equity to ensure that the losses can be covered and the bank does not run out of money. This capital is called Tier 1 Capital, and when it's divided by the bank's total assets this leads to the Tier 1 Capital Ratio - a percentage used by regulators to evaluate bank health. For SVB, according to JPMorgan, once the unrealized losses were accounted for, this ratio dropped to below 1% from an earlier reading of 12%. JPMorgan's own ratio sits a little over 13% and drops a little below 12% once the unrealized losses are accounted for.As JPMorgan points out:While capital, wholesale funding and loan to deposit ratios improved for many US banks since 2008, there are exceptions. As shown in the first chart, SIVB was in a league of its own: a high level of loans plus securities as a percentage of deposits, and very low reliance on stickier retail deposits as a share of total deposits. Bottom line: SIVB carved out a distinct and riskier niche than other banks, setting itself up for large potential capital shortfalls in case of rising interest rates, deposit outflows and forced asset sales.With these gory details in mind, today we'll look at some bank stocks that hedge funds were piling into at the end of 2022. Out of these, the top three are Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge FundsSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

The Fed showed no signs of slowing down until the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 got off to a decent start as the Fed issued a less aggressive rate hike and raised interest rates by 25 basis points at the February meeting. However, inflation is still running at roughly 3 times the target rate of 2%. Economists and analysts are divided on what the Fed will do at the next FOMC meeting in March and what is ahead for the economy.Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director: ""The Downturn Is Closer Than We Thought A Week Ago""On March 14 senior managing director at Evercore ISI, Julian Emanuel, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the market situation in the aftermath of the SVB crisis. Julian Emanuel said that year-end expectations for interest rates are on a wide spread, between 375 basis points and 525 basis points, and so one cannot predict interest rates with absolute certainty in the current environment. Julian Emanuel said that the Fed funds rate is dependent on economic data, and more importantly, it is dependent on the reaction of the markets to that data. In the case that we end 2023 with a Fed funds rate of 375 basis points, it could be both good or bad for the stock market, said Julian Emanuel. He said that if Fed tightening caused the collapse of SVB, the U.S. might end up in a mild recession. However, in the event of a mild recession, Julian Emanuel thinks that the market will hit a necessary bottom that will create an entry point for investors ""that will launch the next bull market phase"". Julian Emanuel reiterated how uncertain and volatile the current market situation is. He also said that before the SVB fallout, his clients were talking about how ""the no landing scenario was operative"", but now that does not seem like the case. Here are some comments from Julian Emanuel about what he expects for the markets ahead:Story continues""Part of the endgame is, we do wanna see a enough of a downturn to make stocks attractive, to cause this cathartic moment, where we can reset and multiples can begin expanding as the economic cycle turns. But we're still a ways from that. However, I would suggest whereas people were thinking this could last into '24, it does feel like the downturn is closer than we thought a week ago.""In the current market environment, many stocks have made new lows. However, it can be argued that some of these companies may be presenting attractive buying opportunities for investors. There are companies that have institutional participation and positive analyst sentiment that have crashed to their 52-week lows. However, it is possible that hedge funds either underestimated the risks associated with these companies or are optimistic about their future performance despite the current decline. Analysts who are positive about the companies may be focusing on their potential for long-term growth, rather than short-term challenges.

It provides attentive service and takes almost no credit risk on loans. A typical First Republic loan might be for 50% of the purchase price of a luxury home in Silicon Valley to an executive whose net worth is multiples of the value of the home. The bank has more than doubled revenue and net income over the past five years. In 2022, it grew household relationships by 15%, a remarkable number for a bank. But First Republic also got pinched in 2022 by the phenomenon of interest rates rising faster for short-term loans than for long-term loans. This happens because the market expects a recession: it costs more to borrow money for a year than for 10 years. For First Republic, this means it is paying high rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to customers, but then lending that money to long-term borrowers for only a bit more yield. Banks depend on a healthy spread between their cost of deposits and what they earn on loans. Lately, First Republic’s net interest margin has been disappointing. Still, earnings per share grew about 7% in 2022.The inversion of the yield curve may continue to pinch earnings growth in 2023, but longer-term First Republic continues to attract affluent customers and, as such, to grow low-risk loan volumes. When you don’t have credit losses and you do have steadily growing loan volumes, income should rise over time.With cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale of ICE in the fourth quarter, we invested more money in existing holdings First Republic Bank, M&amp;T Bank, Carmax, Floor &amp; Décor and SS&amp;C. We ended the year with about 2.5% cash.”13. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Baxter International Inc.

Has this asset stalled or is it a mid-teens grower? Other factors will determine the one true answer to this question, though FX and the stated headline make the answer seem obvious when it is not. When foreign exchange movements are modest, people tend to focus more on FX neutral assuming those changes will normalize over time, yet when movements are extreme the headline takes prominence.”Some of the most popular stocks that have hit new lows and are still held by hedge funds include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Pfizer Inc.

26,352357c8-4585-3b34-8fae-fa40a9252349,WMT,2023-03-15,Walmart: ‘Technology isn’t taking over. It’s empowering our people’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-technology-isn-t-taking-104200724.html,1678876920,STORY,['WMT'],"[In the ongoing debate about people versus machines in business, it feels like we’ve reached a major turning point. Advances based on automation and artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted many questions rooted in fear and curiosity.However, I know for a fact that a human connection element will always be in demand for our business. Our people have and always will make the difference–just like innovation has and always will play a major role in any successful business. This isn’t an either/or question. Technology and people can work together in pursuit of our purpose to help people save money and live better.As a company that’s been around for 60 years, we are in a unique position: We are mature but just getting started–and we’re comfortable with that dichotomy. Today, Walmart is thriving thanks to this approach. We recently released historically strong year-end results–and we’re excited about where we’re headed with our omnichannel strategy.The pandemic has accelerated our strategy and pushed us to meet customers where they are. It also underscored that, fundamentally, people are core to every business. At the time, sophisticated technology propelled our business forward with new services, making everyday life easier for our customers. Now, busy families can use our app to pick up groceries on the way home from gymnastics, or can have their weekly staples delivered straight to the refrigerator. But it’s our associates who make the experience special–choosing the best-looking apples for your order or placing your eggs just where you like them in the refrigerator.When we launched the InHome pilot in a few cities across the U.S. in 2019, one of our first customers in Kansas City developed a special connection with the associate who regularly delivers his groceries. In getting to know the customer, our associate found out they have mobility issues that make carrying and holding heavy items, like a gallon of milk, difficult. So, when a half gallon of milk is out of stock–and the standard replacement would be a full gallon–our associate made it a point to pick smaller sizes for the customer. Or consider customers who are blind and appreciate that our associates will read out expiration dates on the products when they’re delivered.Story continuesThese human, intimate, and nuanced connections are irreplaceable. There’s a profound trust in these relationships–one that we don’t take for granted.The roles and responsibilities of our jobs will no doubt evolve as technology creates more efficiencies. Our business will continue to grow as a result, and our workforce will grow and change alongside it.While automation has not had a significant impact on our headcount, it has helped us reimagine how we utilize our workforce. In creating efficiencies, our intent isn’t to replace our workers, but to shift their focus to the things humans do best: connecting with each other and understanding the subtleties of people’s needs, wants, and hopes. Ultimately, technology is enabling us to create more rewarding and engaging jobs that complement our people’s strengths while serving customers in ways that are faster, easier, and unique to how they live.Take for example that we have started using high-speed palletizing robotics in our distribution centers, which removes one of the toughest parts of the job for our associates: material handling. A job that used to require them to lift tens of thousands of pounds now requires minimal lifting and enables associates to grow their technical competencies through interaction with a digital display. The system also optimizes freight and creates pallets that are ready to go straight from a truck to a store shelf, freeing up associates to work with customers more than materials.As we think about the future of hiring, we see opportunities for people who enjoy people–those who are intellectually curious, empathetic, innovative, and interested in the relationship between people and business outcomes. And, as technology advances, we will also see new jobs like when we expanded our pickup and delivery services before and during the pandemic. Between 2018 and 2020, we added over 130,000 technology-empowered positions in our U.S. stores.An organization only exists if you have great people. I have the good fortune of working among 2.1 million associates worldwide, making an incredible difference for people every day in ways that are deeply and beautifully human.Technology is a wonderful thing–and so are the people who smile at you and ask how your day is going when you walk into our stores. There’s a subtle joy in these experiences that can’t be replicated.Community and relationships are at the very core of who we are as people. Life can be difficult and messy, and that’s only understood by people who have been through shared experiences. Our brains are hard-wired for human connection, and that informs how we must think about jobs and efficiencies.The future of business is one that prioritizes meaningful human interactions while using technology to automate everyday tasks, the two working in harmony.Donna Morris is Walmart’s Chief People Officer.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:The return to the office could be the real reason for the slump in productivity.

The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results showed reflection of this situation, wherein both the top and bottom lines fell year over year.Adjusted earnings came in at 74 cents per share, down from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s $1.23. Total revenues of $4,319 million declined 4.1% year over year due to soft holiday sales trends and high promotions. Gross merchandise value declined 4.2% in the quarter. Net sales fell 4.2% year over year to $4,200 million.Gross profit margin contracted 525 bps year over year to 33.2%, mainly due to higher markdowns. The increased markdowns were the result of the company’s actions to right-size inventory levels in a higher promotional environment.Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $187 million declined 37.5% year over year, primarily due to higher markdowns, partly negated by supply-chain expense efficiencies. EBIT margin declined 235 bps to 4.5%.Going ahead into fiscal 2023, management expects total revenues to decline 4-6% year over year. Revenues are expected to include a 250 bps impact owing to the closing of the Canada operations. Also, this closure is likely to result in a $400 million decline in total revenues.EBIT margin is expected to be between 1.2% and 2.1% of sales, which includes impacts of the charges related to the Canada-business closure. Adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be in the range of 3.7-4.2% of sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of JWN have lost 8.2% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 4.8%.Efforts to Counter HurdlesAlthough muted demand and reduced discretionary spending remain looming concerns for Nordstrom, the company is leaving no stone unturned to get back on track. Its efforts to drive efficiency and improve customer experience via faster order fulfillment along with reducing inventory and increased focus on Nordstrom Rack, bode well.Notably, Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions led to lesser order cancellations, simplified Rack operations and improved profitability.Going ahead, it continues focusing on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortment and increased brand awareness. Driven by these factors, it expects to optimize Rack product mix by mid-2023.The company remains focused on its long-term strategy, which builds on its market strategy to capitalize on its digital-first platform to better serve customers, gain market share and deliver profitable growth. For this, it is focused on three areas – winning in most important markets, expanding the reach of Nordstrom Rack and enhancing its digital velocity. The company boasts approximately 10 million new customers in 2022 and has now added 2.5 million new Nordy Club members.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is on track with expanding efforts and has opened 20 new Rack stores in fiscal 2022. Rack stores continue to be the largest source of new customer acquisition, accounting for more than 40% of newly acquired customers in 2022. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expanded its advertising offering to brands and categories adjacent to Nordstrom as well as launched offsite partnerships with TikTok and Pinterest. Management expects to drive greater engagement and higher profitability at nordstromrack.com.It remains focused on the closer-to-you strategy, which aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expanding online offerings and adding cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores to improve customers' shopping experiences. Increased focus on distribution capabilities along with improved connectivity of physical and digital inventory are likely to contribute to Nordstrom Rack sales by roughly $2 billion in the long-term.As part of the strategy, Nordstrom earlier issued a long-term outlook. It predicted revenues to grow low single-digits on an annual basis, with operating income likely to outpace revenues in the long term. EBIT margin is expected to be more than 6%, with annual operating cash flow anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Capital expenditure is likely to be between 3% and 4% of sales.Story continuesWrapping UpDespite inflation concerns and sluggish demand, Nordstrom is likely to sustain momentum, driven by strong demand, solid online show and long-term growth strategy. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.8% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks you may want to consider, Urban Outfitters URBN, Arhaus ARHS and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.Urban Outfitters, a leading lifestyle product and services company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

By harnessing the power of data and analytics, the city improved the quality of local waterways and can use the $145 million savings to lessen the associated costs for city residents.A collaboration with global water technology leader Xylem (NYSE: XYL), the project recently won an IWA (International Water Association) award for transforming Buffalo’s sewer network by automatically redirecting excess rainwater to underused parts of its system to prevent overflows. The technology allowed BSA to use its existing network and solve a longstanding problem without spending on new infrastructure.""Buffalo’s waterways have come a long way in recent years, with people fishing, strolling along their banks, and enjoying all sorts of festivities,"" said Mayor Byron W. Brown. ""I want to thank Oluwole A. (OJ) McFoy, BSA General Manager, for collaborating with Xylem to incorporate smarter technology into Buffalo’s existing infrastructure network and ensuring that we are sustainable in what we do.""Aging water infrastructure, the impacts of climate change, and tight budgets to pay for upgrades mean utilities must be innovative to solve critical challenges.""This project is about giving Buffalo a new way to manage its existing system. They already have these big assets and pieces of infrastructure. The idea is to give them a little tweak so that they run slightly differently during wet weather and avoid combined sewer discharges into the waterways,"" said Rich Loeffler, Senior Practice and Solutions Architect at Xylem.Using Xylem’s Wastewater Network Optimization System to address high volumes of combined sewer overflows (CSOs), BSA harnessed the power of machine learning, hydraulic modeling, and data and analytics to optimize its network.Story continues""Whether it’s people, dollars, or opportunities, we realize that there are gaps in resources. We seek to bridge those gaps by being smarter and working harder to ensure that we are sustainable in what we do and that we are resilient in that effort,"" said Oluwole A. (OJ) McFoy, BSA General Manager.A Bridge to the FutureBSA used Xylem’s optimization solution to create a real-time decision support system that can visualize, predict, and control flows, regardless of the weather. Similar to a traffic app, the smart sewer system uses data from sensors across the network to pinpoint buildups. When one part of the network is under pressure, the city can redirect flow to underutilized parts of the system.""We have shown this technology is effective and want to ensure that Buffalo remains prepared for the changing climate and the more intense storms coming our way,"" added McFoy.Having successfully embedded the Real Time Control Smart Sewer technology at several sites, BSA has now committed to incorporating it into future projects across the city of Buffalo for a variety of applications. The technology will ultimately reduce the size and number of costly new infrastructure projects by maximizing usage within the overall system.In a city with extremely localized weather patterns, this network of sensors will allow the individual sites to communicate and create capacity where it is needed most.""The technology is unique because it treats the entire collection system as one cohesive, globally coordinated unit. If you only see rain in one part of the city, you may want to maximize or move flows in that portion of the city differently than somewhere where it is not raining,"" added Loeffler.The benefits of the project go beyond costs. BSA is now a greener operation with a solution that limited the need for carbon-intensive infrastructure and advanced the city’s environmental, economic, and water equity objectives.""It's important to understand how it’s all connected and that we're all doing our part to make sure that we have this resource for many generations to come,"" said Kristina Macro, Xylem Project Manager.Meet the people involved in this innovative project by watching this video: How Buffalo, New York, is saving millions through smart sewersAbout XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance.

Now US officials allege he’s at the center of a suspected secret supply chain that prosecutors say used American technology to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.Most Read from BloombergUS Studies Ways to Insure All Bank Deposits If Crisis GrowsUBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3.3 Billion Deal to End CrisisJPMorgan Owned the LME ‘Nickel’ That Was Actually Bags of StonesVanguard Said to Shutter Business in China, Exit Ant VentureJPMorgan Sees Increasing Chances of ‘Minsky Moment’The son of a Siberian governor was arrested last year on charges that he and his associates defrauded the US and its companies and also violated sanctions by selling sensitive technologies from the US to Russia via intermediaries in non-sanctioned countries. He’s the most politically connected Russian to be indicted by the US as Washington races to choke off Moscow’s access to chips used in weapons systems. Uss has denied any wrongdoing and is now in the midst of an extradition battle in Milan.Court documents from the Uss case and others like it show how Russia allegedly built a secret pipeline for years before the war to ensure the supply of semiconductors to the country despite US controls. Those well-honed tactics are now helping Russian operators rebuild dismantled networks and deceive publicly listed US tech companies, according to customs data, indictments and people familiar with the matter, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media.American prosecutors haven’t identified the semiconductor manufacturers who may have sold to Uss’s team unwittingly, and he is now under house arrest in Milan. Even so, US and EU officials say that Russia is still able to get chips and technology for military use through other networks. Customs data analyzed by the British think tank Royal United Services Institute and seen by Bloomberg also show that semiconductors made by large companies including Analog Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Microchip Technology Inc. have been getting to Russia via third-party firms in other parts of the world for months after the war started. The companies say they follow the law, don’t sell to Russia and they haven’t authorized the sale of their products there.Story continues“We should be assuming that much of our sensitive technologies are making their way into the wrong hands,” said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner and chair of the national security practice at Washington-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, who served as a senior official at the US Department of Commerce. “The third-party intermediary problem is a fairly easy and significant loophole.”For more, read: Russia Is Getting Round Sanctions to Buy Key Chips for Its WarUss and his associates allegedly operated before and after the invasion, according to a US indictment. Prosecutors say they set up small shell companies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia — essentially Trojan horses to convince chip-makers in California, Pennsylvania and New York that they were selling to non-sanctioned jurisdictions.They fabricated certificates that falsified the end user, the charges allege. One front company they set up in Malaysia had several addresses, but only one had a visible sign and even that was located in an empty room in a strip mall, the prosecutors allege. The items were ultimately sent to customers in Russia, including US-sanctioned defense contractors, the indictment says.The same indictment also accuses Uss’s team of simultaneously profiting by selling sanctioned Venezuelan oil. The Russian defendants are also charged with defrauding US banks.Listen to The Big Take Podcast episode: How Are US Chips Ending Up in Russian Weapons?Uss, 40, says he didn’t do anything wrong, isn’t responsible for anything his associates may have allegedly done, and argues that he shouldn’t be extradited because he risks being treated unfairly in the US, people familiar with his legal defense say, declining to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. Dressed in a dark gray suit as he left his closed door hearing in Milan in February, he declined to comment. His lawyers also declined to answer questions.The US has had restrictions on Russian purchases of military-related technology for years, but it’s been sharply accelerating those controls since Putin invaded Ukraine in February last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia doesn’t consider the restrictions placed by US “legal from the point of view of international law.”“Sanctions are what has been decided on by the UN Security Council — these are nothing more than unilateral, illegal restrictions,” Peskov said.Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important to the outcome of the war. Russia has been ramping up its push to get chips, suggesting its stockpiles aren’t deep enough and Moscow’s efforts are unlikely to have resolved shortages, said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.Ukraine’s government has publicly urged tech giants including Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. to stop making microchips that it says support Russia’s Glonass satellite navigation system. Representatives at Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment.Analog Devices in a statement said that any post-sanctions shipments into Russia, the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine and Belarus is a direct violation of its policies “and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products.” The company has ramped up monitoring of gray market activities, it said.Microchip also said in a statement that it doesn’t sell to sanctioned regions and works on screening customers.“We do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren’t designed for,” Texas Instruments said in a statement, adding that it doesn’t sell into Russia or Belarus.In addition to Uss, the US charged six other individuals in October, including Yury Orekhov, whom it identified as a former employee at a Russian aluminum firm. Lawyers for Orekhov didn’t respond to a request for comment.The team “engaged in a variety of activities in violation of US laws and regulations sanctions, including the unlawful export of millions of US dollars in military and sensitive dual-use technologies from the United States to Russia, and the use of the US financial system to smuggle millions of barrels of embargoed oil from Venezuela,” the charges said.In a press release, the US Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, which filed the charges, said this alleged network “schemed to procure sophisticated technology in direct support of a floundering Russian Federation military industrial complex.”They used fake purchase orders, business records and shipping documents to fool American chipmakers, the court documents allege. All that helped mask the end user: The Russian military, according to prosecutors. Illicit deliveries continued after Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022 attack on Ukraine, at least until the end of March that year, prosecutors said. Components made by several of the US companies were found in seized Russian weapons platforms in Ukraine, the charges said.At other times, Uss’s associates falsely told US chipmakers that their products were headed to Roscosmos, the Russian space program that still has cooperative agreements with NASA, according to the charges. A spokesperson at NASA declined to comment.Orekhov shuttled between Germany and Dubai, where he had a property on the pricey artificial island of Palm Jumeirah, according to US prosecutors. He relied on companies based in the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Russia and Malaysia, the indictment said.Both Uss and Orekhov got involved in the scheme after the US blacklisted another co-defendant Timofey Telegin and his defense contracting firm in 2018, court documents allege. Telegin had come under scrutiny after two of his employees were detained in the US on charges of trying to illegally acquire sensitive military technology two years earlier, according to court documents. No lawyers for Telegin have filed public notices of appearances and he couldn't be reached for comment about the case.Russia is constantly seeking new loopholes as US pressure builds, according to Adam Smith, a former top Treasury official who worked on Russia sanctions policy and is now at the law firm Gibson Dunn. “There are perhaps two hundred other jurisdictions they could potentially leverage.”The analysis by the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, showed that nearly all the American semiconductors that reached Russia in recent customs data were bought by companies in China and eventually reached the manufacturer of Russia’s Orlan-10 drones.Biden officials have raised concerns about Russia’s access to chips with other countries, including China and the UAE, according to people with knowledge of the conversations, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media. A spokesperson at the Department of Commerce said the US will continue to communicate with other countries about its controls, monitor developments and “act as appropriate to deny Russia the items it needs to sustain its war machine.”Unlike the EU and US, China and the UAE don’t have sanctions on Russia.“The UAE adheres to, and strictly enforces, international laws and UN mandated sanctions, alongside agreements established with international partners, including the US,” a UAE official said in a statement to Bloomberg. The Middle Eastern country says it has systems in place to monitor illicit fund flows and has put in sophisticated customs systems to monitor products, including sensitive technologies.China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it isn’t aware of the details surrounding the chips issue and its stance is to promote peace and talks in Ukraine. The US has frequently spread false information on the subject of China’s relations with Russia, it said.US and EU officials have said that Russia also continues to access foreign chips and technology through intermediaries like Iran, Turkey, the UAE and Kazakhstan.The US in February sanctioned a Swiss-Italian businessman, accusing him and his associates of using companies in the UAE, Switzerland, Malta and Bulgaria for acquiring sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russia intelligence and military.In Italy, meanwhile, Uss remains under house arrest. He faces up to 30 years in a US prison if extradited. The Milan tribunal is yet to rule on the US extradition request.The indictment says that Uss’s alleged involvement in the chips smuggling started in 2018, the same year his father secured election as governor of the resource-rich Krasnoyarsk region.On social media, Uss’s father, Alexander, who is a member of the ruling party, has denounced the case against his son as fabricated by the US. “The political nature of these accusations is obvious,” he said in a Telegram post.The US sanctioned both father and son in December. Alexander Uss didn’t respond to requests for comment submitted via his press service.Russia, meanwhile, has put the younger Uss on a wanted list for alleged money-laundering and is asking for his handover. Uss in mid-January asked the Milan court hearing his extradition case to send him instead to Russia to face charges, the Russian state news service Tass reported.Although the US said in June last year that Russian semiconductor imports were slashed by 90% because of its curbs, the US industry association warned in January of the “broad challenges in preventing the illicit purchase and counterfeiting” of American chips.Read more: Putin Stirs EU Worry on Home Appliance Imports Stripped for ArmsAlso frustrating US efforts to limit the trade, Moscow has switched its focus to acquiring less advanced consumer-grade components that are easier to procure, Bloomberg News has reported.“This is ultimately a contest of wills,” said James Byrne, an expert in technology and security at RUSI. “The Russians need this, it’s critical to their military program, so they have to acquire it. They’ll go to great lengths for that.”--With assistance from Jillian Deutsch and Eric Martin.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpTrump’s Tariffs Couldn’t Save the California Olive IndustryA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight TrainsPumping Heat a Mile Underground Is Helping One City Cut CarbonFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhones©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
39,26f87f21-405c-3817-92be-5f61fe13386b,MCHP,2023-03-15,3 Solid Buys from the Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-solid-buys-semiconductor-industry-170005747.html,1678813205,STORY,"['MCHP', 'SLAB', 'ADI']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient.  Our current picks are Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).About the IndustryThis industry includes mostly semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel Corporation (INTC).Major Themes for the IndustryThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.Story continuesThe industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Data center demand has also dropped off sharper than expected as leading tech players absorbed the reduction in advertising demand. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains. The situation is expected to gradually improve as we get into the second half partly because some of the demand is expected to come back, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn’t have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That’s because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As semiconductors become important in defense, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Relatively Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it in the top 23% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, it appears that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook has improved while that for 2024 has weakened slightly: 2023 estimates have risen 5.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 3.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveThe Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the S&amp;P 500 through most of the past year and starting from November it has pulled way ahead as the S&amp;P essentially flatlined. The broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector has trailed the S&amp;P 500 since April.Overall, the industry gained 13.1% over the past year while the broader sector lost 14.1% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.0%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 17.12X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.33X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 21.22X. At the current level, it is however trading at a premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between a 13.80X and 18.74X multiple over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devices’ strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. Demand in these markets, particularly for automation and electrification are currently driving its business. These along with pervasive sensing, AI-driven edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity that are enabling new capabilities, applications and markets at the Intelligent Edge are secular drivers.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing its output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has allowed it to lower lead times. However, it still has a significant backlog, which would translate into a year’s revenue at the current level.Shipments are expected to increase through the year, bringing the backlog back to normal levels. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 13%, making it the fifth consecutive double-digit increase, and the 19th straight year of dividend increase.The company beat January quarter estimates by 6.2% and in the last 30 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company dropped a couple of cents The 2024 estimate increased by 90 cents (9.0%).The shares are up 25.3% over the past year.Price and Consensus: ADIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip Technology Inc. (MCHP): Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where supply constraints are only now beginning to ease up.Management is currently focused on bringing down its backlog while maintaining the quality of new orders. As supply continues to improve and lead times come down, profitability will also improve. However, China’s imposing and then suddenly raising its lockdown has resulted in inventory gluts that are an overhang on Microchip’s business.Investors would be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 41.5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 7 cents (1.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate increased 35 cents (6.0%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchip’s shares are up 19.3% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHPZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSilicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB): Silicon Laboratories is a fabless semiconductor company offering wireless microcontrollers and sensor products primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan. Its products are used in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including connected home and security, industrial automation and control, smart metering, smart lighting, commercial building automation, consumer electronics, asset tracking and medical instrumentation.Silicon Laboratories is seeing solid momentum in its business, which has allowed it to double its organic revenue in two years  and increase its design wins by 120%. Management continues to see significant opportunity and expects the design win momentum to continue, further building its leadership position in IoT, despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.Silicon Laboratories topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 35.1% in the last quarter. Its 2023 EPS estimate has jumped a dollar (25.3%) in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 49 cents (9.0%).Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 26.2% over the past year.Price and Consensus: SLABZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

40,df3e7020-2f0d-329c-8934-ee92d5419b98,MCHP,2023-03-15,Fed May Stick to 25 bps Rate Hike After SVB Fiasco: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-may-stick-25-bps-124012052.html,1678797612,STORY,"['HSBC', 'AMP', 'HSIC', 'MCHP', 'RE']","[Wall Street tumbled last week following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank — the biggest bank failure since the days of the great recession of 2008. Market participants remained highly concerned that the ripple effect of the bank’s failure may shake the broad market. However, a sliver lining in the SVB disaster is that the Fed may be compelled to stick to a 25 basis points hike in interest rate in its March FOMC meeting.A Hawkish FedThe Fed hiked the benchmark interest by a staggering 4.25% in 2022 to combat 40-year high inflation. The inflation rate reached its peak at 9.1% in June 2022 and thereafter declined to 6 — 6.5% in December, though it stayed significantly higher than the central bank’s 2% target rate.A steady decline in the inflation rate in the last three months of 2022 enabled the Fed to reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 25 basis points. However, a sudden spike in inflation in January and a series of strong economic data changed the whole scenario.On Mar 7 and 8, in his testimony to the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that interest rates are likely to head higher than what central bank policymakers had anticipated. In the December FOMC meeting, Fed officials had estimated the terminal interest rate to be at 5.1% for this rate hike cycle.However, after Powell’s testimony, the CME FedWatch showed that market participants expect the terminal interest rate to be within 5.5% to 5.75% range. Moreover, the CME FedWatch showed a 73.5% probability that the Fed would hike the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in the March FOMC meeting while the probability of a 25 basis-points hike is just 26.5%. These situations were almost reversed just before the release of Powell’s testimony.Government Assures SVB Depositors About Their MoneyMarket participants’ expectations regarding rate hike have changed significantly after last week’s SVB debacle. The bank is the first major casualty of the Fed’s aggressive rate hike. A large section of economists and financial experts have warned that the Federal Government should immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank’s failure will shake the broad market.Story continuesInvestors are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. Clients of SVB’s startup companies, especially from the technology sector, will find it hard to run their business. Venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital. This has forced the U.S. government to assure all SVB depositors about their money.Moreover, the Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls came in at 311,000 in February, beating the consensus estimate of 227,000. However, the number declined significantly from January’s data of 504,000.The unemployment rate increased to 3.6% in February from 3.4% in January. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% in February compared with a 0.3% rise in January. Year over year, hourly wage rate rose 4.6% in February, below the consensus estimate of 4.8%.Consequently, the CME FedWatch is now showing an overwhelming 70.9% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the March FOMC meeting. Importantly, 29.1% respondents expect the central bank to keep the interest rate static at the current range of 4.5 to 4.75%. No respondent expects a more than 25 basis point rate hike.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have applied our VGM Style Score to narrow the search to select five companies that have strong earnings growth potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

Jared's at the YFi Interactive for a check of the markets. First, we had SVB. Credit Suisse now causing a lot of consternation in the banking world.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, and to be fair here, Credit Suisse is a lot bigger than Silicon Valley Bank-- about two and 1/2 times total assets. And let's just see what's happening in the stock futures in the US, and then we can check what's happening in the banking sector overnight. S&amp;P futures down 1.86%. And if you see this chart-- this is from midnight last night Eastern time-- just a slow, steady decline really accelerating during the European session. We can see the NASDAQ futures, they are off a little bit less than the Dow futures.Pretty similar story here. Do want to track what's happening with WTI crude oil. We are seeing it with a $69 handle-- haven't seen it below $70 in months and months. And so the global growth story now coming into question. And I want to show you what's going on in the bond market as well. The 10-year T-note yield, that is down another 15 basis points. I'm going to show you a three-month chart with candlesticks just so you can see.Last week, we were at 4%. We hit 3.5%, actually lower than that, bounced up yesterday and are back down. All of this translating into huge, huge bond market volatility. This is a B of A MOVE index. This is at the highest level. I'm going to put a 20-year chart. Guess what? We surpassed-- and it's hard to see here-- we surpassed the pandemic high, and we are now in territory that we haven't seen since the global financial crisis.So something to keep an eye on there. And all of this playing out with more fallout in the banking system. But this time, it's not the regionals. We're worried about the majors, and specifically overseas. Credit Suisse-- let's see if I can find it here-- it is much smaller than it used to be, down about 25% last time I checked. And as Julie, you were talking about just earlier, the cost to insure debt against default has just skyrocketed.Story continuesHere is a 20-year chart. And you can see that this stock used to be, what, a $70, $80 stock? That was before the global financial crisis a long time ago. Now $2.51. We're probably looking at-- and we're going to talk about this a lot-- we're going to talk about a potential restructuring of it, a sale-- we don't know what's going to happen, but again, this is a European bank. Different story than what happens with the American side of things, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: Of course. But all of them are interconnected, right?JARED BLIKRE: Very much so.JULIE HYMAN: And so that's why you have these concerns here that are now-- everybody is sort of on edge following Silicon Valley Bank. And now that is infecting everything--JARED BLIKRE: Understandably so.JULIE HYMAN: --even things that don't have to do directly with it. So we're going to talk much more about that.]"

According to an Energy Aspects analyst, half of that will come from increased demand for gasoline and jet fuel as travel rebounds.Demand for diesel is also seen rebounding but more slowly as it is tied to manufacturing activity and this will take longer to recover from the lockdowns than travel, FGE, and Energy Aspects analysts explained.China’s crude oil imports averaged 10.4 million barrels per day in January and February, down by 1.3% compared to the same months in 2022, according to official Chinese data in tons estimated in barrels by Reuters’ Asia commodities and energy columnist Clyde Russell.The imports were also below the more than 11.3 million bpd of oil imported in November and December last year. Yet the first two months of 2023 were when the Chinese celebrated the Lunar New Year, which is traditionally a period of subdued demand for crude oil.China has announced it expects economic growth of 5% this year and while this was at the lower end of analyst expectations, it is still a much higher growth rate compared to European or North American economies and will likely contribute to a substantial increase in demand for oil.Story continuesBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:LNG Market Could Become Too Saturated By 2027Goldman Betting On Fed To Skip March Rate HikeIndia’s Opportunistic Pursuit Of Cheaper Oil From RussiaRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

It has a footprint of about 500 acres, while the NPR-A is a 23 million-acre area on the North Slope originally set aside 100 years ago by President Warren Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy before it was transferred to the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and opened for potential oil and gas leasing in 1976.ConocoPhillips, which will develop the Willow Project, said it estimates the project will provide between $8 billion and $17 billion in new tax revenue to the federal government, the state of Alaska and North Slope Borough communities.The project has the potential to create over 2,500 construction jobs and approximately 300 long-term jobs.MANCHIN ALIGNS WITH GOP ON BIDEN OIL DRILLING PROJECT, DEFENDS RECORD ON ENERGY PRODUCTION AS DEMS FRETThe Trans-Alaska Pipeline moves crude oil from Prudhoe Bay to the ice-free port of Valdez, Alaska. The approval of the Willow Project on Alaska's North Slope will add up to 180,000 barrels of oil output per day to America's energy supplies.The company estimated the Willow Project will yield a peak of 180,000 barrels of oil per day or more than 65 million barrels per year, which will reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil. It also noted that the Willow Project went through five years of regulatory review under the National Environmental Policy Act and is designed with mitigation measures intended to avoid interfering with the subsistence activities of Alaska Native communities.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP""This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,"" said ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance. ""Willow fits within the Biden administration’s priorities on environmental and social justice, facilitating the energy transition and enhancing our energy security, all while creating good union jobs and providing benefits to Alaska Native communities.Story continuesBIDEN APPROVES MASSIVE OIL DRILLING PROJECT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS DERIDED AS ‘CARBON BOMB’""We are truly grateful for the steadfast support from Alaska’s congressional delegation — senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Representative Mary Peltola — Alaska Native communities, the state legislature and organized labor groups.""President Biden has faced criticism from environmental groups for his administration's approval of the Willow Project.While the Biden administration approved the Willow Project, it did narrow its scope when the Bureau of Land Management and Interior declined a request by ConocoPhillips to develop five drilling pads and instead granted approval for just three.MASSIVE OIL PROJECT SPARKED CIVIL WAR WITHIN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, LAWMAKERS SAYThe administration said this would reduce the need for the construction of additional roads and pipelines and gravel associated with the two rejected sites, the elimination of which ""reduces potential impacts to caribou migration and subsistence users.""Prior to the decision, ConocoPhillips said three drill sites were the minimum required to make the energy project economically viable.The Biden administration approved just three of the potential five oil sites in the Willow Project, reducing the need for additional construction of roads and pipelines.Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, supported the Willow Project and its approval but also criticized a separate move by the Biden administration to block future oil and gas development on nearly 16 million acres of Alaska.Dunleavy called the decision ""disgraceful"" and said that rather than reducing global oil consumption, it will ""just shift the market and give leverage to producers in countries that don’t have our high standards for the environment and human rights.""He added, ""In the end, every American pays the price when President Biden restricts our ability to develop our own energy resources.""Environmental groups have continued to express opposition to the Willow Project despite the Biden administration’s approval.The Climate Justice Alliance, a nationwide network of climate justice groups, condemned the Biden administration for greenlighting the Willow Project. The group’s co-executive directors Bineshi Albert, Monica Atkins and Marion Gee said in a joint statement, ""You can’t approve the largest oil extraction site on public U.S. lands in the midst of a climate emergency and expect Indigenous, Black, brown and other frontline communities to take you at your word.""Real and safe community solutions, such as community-controlled solar and wind, are what we need investment in now,"" they added. ""Unproven and risky, corporate technologies such as carbon capture and storage will further devastate our communities and prolong the harms of the fossil fuel industry. ConocoPhillips and other fossil fuel giants don’t need more profits or government favors.""]"

Last but not least, we’ve got stuff on the sustainability side.”The company is expanding its gas storage capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast through acquisition. Enbridge recently agreed to purchased Tres Palacios gas storage, a 35-Bcf salt cavern gas storage facility in Matagorda County, Texas, for $335 million.One of the drivers of gas demand on the Gulf Coast is an increase in liquefied natural gas export volumes, Enbridge said in regulatory filings. The company already connects with four Gulf Coast LNG facilities, and the company anticipates supplying two to three more in the future.Enbridge already supplies four Gulf Coast LNG facilities with natural gas and is expanding pipelines to reach additional plants.

The company said it is in negotiations with shippers for up to 95,000 bbl/d of incremental capacity on Enbridge’s Flanagan South Pipeline system, which transports crude oil from Enbridge’s terminal in Flanagan, Illinois, to Cushing, Oklahoma.Story continuesIn connection with the Flanagan South Pipeline open season, Enbridge decided to move forward with building the Enbridge Houston Oil Terminal (EHOT) to handle the incremental commitments.The $240 million EHOT project will be built at the terminus of the Seaway Pipeline, which originates in Cushing and moves crude to the Gulf Coast refining hub near Houston.With an expected capacity of 2.5 MMbbl, EHOT will have export opportunities through docks at Freeport, Texas, and Texas City. EHOT will also have future access to Enterprise Product Partners’ offshore export terminal, the Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT).Expansion through transactionsEnbridge also sees opportunity to increase its footprint in key onshore regions like the Permian Basin. In January, the company acquired Diamondback Energy Inc.’s 10% interest in the Gray Oak Pipeline for $180 million. The line connects the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to market hubs in Corpus Christi and Freeport.Enbridge is chasing over $3.6 billion in growth opportunities along the U.S. Gulf Coast, including pipeline expansions and terminal growth. (Source: Enbridge 2023 Investor Day materials)Last year, Enbridge grew its stake in Gray Oak from 22.8% to 58.5% as a result of a joint venture merger transaction with Phillips 66. After buying the 10% stake from Diamondback, Enbridge’s interest in Gray Oak Pipeline grew to 68.5%.In November 202, Enbridge boosted its stake in the Cactus II Pipeline up to 30% through a $177 million deal with Western Midstream Partners.And Enbridge picked up a 20% interest in the Cactus II Pipeline, which runs from the Delaware Basin to Corpus Christi, as part of the company’s $3 billion acquisition of Moda Midstream LLC in 2021. The deal also included the massive Ingleside Energy Center, one of the largest crude oil export complexes in the U.S.“We have storage facilities in place that’ll allow our customers to utilize that storage, whether it’s for use in Gulf Coast refineries or, ultimately, for export out of Ingleside,” Ebel said.RELATED: Enbridge Buying Gulf Coast Gas Storage Facility for $335 MillionFood waste to energyIn addition to investments in its core gas and liquids segments, Enbridge continues to develop its low-carbon portfolio. At the beginning of March, Enbridge bought a 10% equity stake in Massachusetts-based Divert Inc., which converts food waste into renewable natural gas (RNG), for $80 million.RNG, biogas that has been upgraded to pipeline quality, has attracted investments from other large players such as BP and Shell.RELATED: Enbridge, Divert Partner in $1 Billion Plan to Scale Up RNGBut to blend the pipeline-ready biogas with natural gas to move to buyers requires pipeline infrastructure. As one of North America’s largest pipeline operators, investing in RNG was a perfect fit for Enbridge, Ebel said.“As these RNG projects get located in and around where our pipelines are, and as we’re able to structure them with long-term contracts like our pipelines, we’re able to make some progress on the sustainability front. That’s a win-win-win scenario,” Ebel said.]"

55,cfc84fa7-9973-3bfd-be98-a37cc2ff56fe,FE,2023-03-15,What's next in Ohio corruption probe after guilty verdicts?,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-ohio-corruption-probe-175844238.html,1678816724,STORY,['FE'],"[COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The largest corruption case in Ohio history culminated last week with guilty verdicts for ex-House Speaker Larry Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges, the former head of the Republican Party. But the state's attorney general said it's “only the beginning of accountability” for the now-tainted $1 billion bailout of two aging nuclear power plants.Householder, 63, and Borges, 50, could spend up to 20 years in prison for their racketeering conspiracy convictions. The jury agreed with prosecutors that Householder orchestrated a $60 million bribery scheme, secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., to secure his power, elect his allies and pass the bailout bill — and that Borges took part in a dirty-tricks campaign to protect the bailout law from referendum.The investigation remains open, and additional lawsuits and regulatory actions remain unresolved. Here's a look at where things stand:COULD THE SENTENCES BE APPEALED?It's likely. Householder and Borges are out on bond. They have until next Thursday to file any motions, including for a new trial. They'll be sentenced once those motions are resolved and the probation office's pre-sentence investigation is complete, which could take weeks. They will then have 14 days to appeal their sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.These were the last of the parties arrested in July 2020. Political strategist Jeffrey Longstreth, who worked on Householder's election campaign, and lobbyist Juan Cespedes pleaded guilty and testified in the seven-week trial. The government will likely recommend reduced sentences for them.Generation Now, a “dark money” group that was used to funnel FirstEnergy's millions to Longstreth, Householder and others, also pleaded guilty for its role. A fifth individual charged, longtime Statehouse lobbyist Neil Clark, died by suicide in March 2021.Story continuesWHO ELSE MIGHT BE CHARGED?As the government's investigation continues, a number of other names have surfaced.In a deal to avoid prosecution, FirstEnergy admitted paying a $4.3 million bribe for favorable treatment to Sam Randazzo, the state's former top utility regulator, who had ties to the company. Randazzo resigned a day after the FBI searched his home. Randazzo has denied wrongdoing and hasn't been charged.There also have been no charges against the FirstEnergy executives fired after Householder and others were arrested. Those executives include former CEO Chuck Jones and former Vice President for External Affairs Michael Dowling, whose texts, emails and travel itineraries factored heavily into the case against Householder.Prosecutors say the executives met with Householder to hatch the scheme over a fancy dinner in Washington — which Householder refuted on the stand. Jones says neither he nor any other FirstEnergy employee engaged in “unlawful activities in their dealings with government officials,” speaking through a New York-based public relations firm.Individuals with ties to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine have also come up through investigations or lawsuits.Lt. Gov. Jon Husted was considered an ally by the FirstEnergy executives in their fight for the bailout bill.Dan McCarthy was a former FirstEnergy lobbyist and Husted confidante who formed another dark money group involved, then worked as a lobbyist on the governor's behalf.Mike Dawson was a onetime consultant to FirstEnergy. His wife Laurel Dawson was the governor's chief of staff, and she helped vet Randazzo for the utility regulator chairmanship and approved sending a state plane to pick up lawmakers for the bailout vote. The flight ultimately never happened.The governor's office says all its employees' actions were above board — and notes that no staff have been questioned.WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE OTHER LAWSUITS?Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost asked a Franklin County judge last week to lift the stay on discovery in the state's separate civil racketeering case. That would let him continue collecting documents and deposing witnesses, which he said could “reveal an expanded number of defendants.”One group of lawsuits by FirstEnergy shareholders was settled last year. A deal required the company to reform its corporate governance, transparency and ethics. However, a shareholder wants the settlement reconsidered, and that's still pending. Additional corporate governance requirements were included in FirstEnergy's prosecution deferral agreement. To avoid prosecution, the company must satisfy those requirements by July 2024.FirstEnergy still faces shareholder lawsuits alleging the company committed securities violations. Defendants include both Jones and his successor, former CEO and President Steven Strah, who abruptly retired in September. A class certification hearing is scheduled before a federal judge in that case on Friday.WHAT REGULATORY ACTIONS ARE POSSIBLE?FirstEnergy has faced scrutiny from state and federal utility regulators as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Four investigations by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio were paused last week for an additional six months, as the federal probe continues. Those efforts target FirstEnergy's political and charitable contributions, its compliance with corporate separation laws, and whether details brought to light by the Householder case were properly disclosed as the company sought past rate and capital recovery adjustments.The Ohio Consumers' Counsel, which represents residential utility customers, was subpoenaing documents and deposing witnesses when the reviews were halted.Meanwhile, FirstEnergy “fully resolved” matters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a consent agreement signed in January. The regulatory commission found FirstEnergy failed to disclose nearly $94 million in lobbying for the bailout bill. It was fined $3.9 million. The SEC's review continues.WHAT STATEHOUSE SOLUTIONS ARE PROPOSED?Legislation containing the bailout gave FirstEnergy a guaranteed-profit subsidy, but that was nixed by a settlement agreement last year. The nuclear bailout provisions of the bill also were repealed. Some lawmakers are fighting to repeal other energy subsidies included in the sweeping measure, which ratepayers are still paying for.Different groups of House Republicans and Democrats introduced anticorruption legislation this session. They say the proposed laws could address gaps in campaign finance law highlighted by the case — gaps that allow uncontrolled raising and spending of money through dark money groups.Others are calling for more transparency under Ohio's lobbying laws, which required few to no details be made public about the plane trips, wining and dining, sports tickets and other perks Householder testified to receiving.Those bills' prospects are unclear.]"

Named the American Australian Association Murdoch Center, it will serve as a meeting place for Americans and Australians to collaborate in pursuit of strong ties between their two nations.The Center, located at 600 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, formally opened on March 14 with United States Ambassador to Australia, the Hon.

It will also empower the Association to carry forward its mission of deepening economic engagement between the two nations through business roundtables, conferences and in other gatherings that encourage trade, investment and innovation.

Nationally, homeowners who list the week of April 16-22, 2023 will hit the sweet spot in terms of the best combination of higher prices, fewer homes to compete against, faster sales time and strong buyer demand. A recent survey from Realtor.com® and HarrisX found that 60% of home sellers took up to 3 months to get their home ready to list, so for homeowners who have been making preparations, listing during that crucial April week could get $48,000 more for their home than they would have at the start of the year.The Best Time to Sell is April 16-22, according to Realtor.com®""Many home shoppers kick off their search in the early spring and they often beat the majority of home sellers to the punch,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""For this reason, sellers who list on the earlier side will get more buyer attention and therefore be more likely to sell quickly and for a higher price.""Why is April 16-22 the best time to sell?While mortgage rates are expected to remain elevated through 2023, for-sale inventory is still well below pre-pandemic levels, so sellers can still expect well-priced homes to be in high demand. Those looking to take advantage of seasonal market trends should consider getting ready to list April 16-22, which is anticipated to have the best mix of market conditions for sellers, including:Higher prices – Homes listed during this week have historically had prices 2.1% higher than the average week throughout the year, and are typically 12.1% higher than the start of the year. If 2023 follows the typical seasonal trend, the national median listing price could reach $8,400 higher than the average week, and $48,000 more than the start of the year.Strong buyer demand – The more buyers looking at a home, the better, as the home is likely to get more offers and sell quickly. Historically, this week garnered 16.4% more views per listing than the typical week, but in 2022 this week got 32.5% more views per listing than the average week, as buyer demand dropped in the latter part of the year.Fast-selling homes – Thanks to above-average demand, homes tend to sell more quickly during this week. Historically, homes actively for sale during this week sold 18.0% faster than the average week. In the fast-moving 2022 market, this week saw homes typically on the market for 32 days, 13 days faster than the year's average, and 37 days faster than was typical in 2019. The 2023 market is not expected to move as quickly as in 2022, but the best week is still expected to see faster sales than the year's typical pace.Less competition from other sellers – Typically, there would be 9.3% fewer sellers on the market during this week compared to the average week throughout the year. Last year saw significant inventory gains as buyer demand cooled, but sellers responded by pulling back on listings by the end of the year. Active inventory was 65.5% higher at the start of 2023 versus 2022, but still 43.2% lower than pre-pandemic levels. This gap means there continues to be opportunities for sellers who enter the market this spring.Story continuesTips on prepping a home for saleAccording to Realtor.com®'s survey, it took most recent sellers (80%) between 2 weeks and 6 months to prepare their home for sale, with the sweet spot being between 1-3 months (32%). For most (56%) it took more time than expected to list their home, while 23% said it was faster than expected and 22% said it took about as long as they expected. For those considering a home sale this year, it's best to start preparing now in case it takes longer than anticipated.For the best chance at a quick sale and high price, homeowners should make sure that their home looks its best, has been well cared for and is up-to-date with routine maintenance. To get ready to list, about a third of recent sellers (35%) made repairs/updates to the home, did some cleaning and decluttering (33%) and found an agent to help them (31%). In order to best market their home, owners and their agents had listing photos taken (34%); created marketing materials such as flyers (27%); created a 3D/virtual tour (20%) and staged the home (11%).Making minor repairs can go a long way during a showing. Potentially, a buyer who sees leaky faucets and closet doors that don't close might become concerned about larger potential problems with the home. The most common repairs made by survey respondents were:Minor cosmetic updates such as replacing light fixtures or faucets (16%)Carpet/floor replacement or refinishing (14%)Landscaping such as mulch, vegetation, etc. (13%)Full painting of exterior (12%)Touch-up paint (12%)Full painting of interior (12%)Replacing appliances such as kitchen or laundry (11%)Replacing the roof (9%)Replacing major systems such as HVAC, hot water (8%)Caulking (6%)Replacing grout (6%)""In today's market, it's really important to price your home well and make sure that it looks its best in order to get top dollar and find a buyer quickly,"" said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst Realtor.com®. ""There are still buyers in the market, but due to high prices and interest rates, they're being a bit more picky than they were the past several years.""Homeowners who are looking to sell their home can visit Realtor.com® to find a trusted agent in their area and check out Realtor.com®'s Complete Guide for Selling Your Home.Report MethodologyListing metrics (e.g. list prices) from 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 were measured on a weekly basis, with each week compared against a benchmark from the first full week of the year. Averaging across the years yielded the ""typical"" seasonal trend for each metric. Percentile levels for each week were calculated along each metric (prices, listings, days on market, etc.), and were then averaged together across metrics to determine a Best Time to List score for each week. Rankings for each week were based on these Best Time to List scores.Survey MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 3-10, 2023, among 2,286 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 2.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups. The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Results were weighted for age by gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The bestselling author on AI, who founded Sinovation Ventures more than a decade ago, has been at the heart of China’s growing adoption of the technology and backed some of its biggest startups in the field like Megvii and Meitu.Firms around the world are rushing to show off their latest AI creations since OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT demonstrated the technology’s potential to a wider audience. Baidu Inc. is set to unveil on Thursday its own ChatGPT rival that will be China’s most significant entry in the race with the US to stake out the nascent arena. Lee called the Beijing firm China’s obvious frontrunner in this field, though it will be far from alone.“The US continues to be the world’s breakthrough innovator,” the 61-year-old VC founder said from his office in Beijing in his first interview with foreign media since the end of Covid restrictions. But China’s internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are “all building large models on par with OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google” in terms of scale.Lee’s 2018 book “AI Superpowers” was an early exploration of the rising conflict between the US and China in the technology industry, detailing the strengths and weaknesses of each country. He published “AI 2041” two years ago with science fiction writer Chen Qiufan to imagine what the technology was capable of decades into the future.Story continuesHis optimism about China’s tech players comes despite intensifying trade sanctions by Washington cutting off access to the latest hardware and exacerbating divisions between the two internet spheres. The AI market will remain decoupled, he said, much in the way that internet services are today. But the former Apple Inc. and Microsoft executive sees that as just “small obstacles in light of a tidal wave revolution.”US efforts to limit the rise of China as a geopolitical rival include orders to keep the gold-standard for AI-training semiconductors — Nvidia Corp.’s A100 and its successor H100 chip — out of China. Lee believes Chinese AI companies will be able to find substitutes, even if it won’t be an ideal situation for those seeking to do massive-scale training.“There are approximate other chips that can be used as substitutes. Nvidia has the A800, which is pretty good,” Lee said, adding “it’s also not a desperate situation by any means.”He also doesn’t foresee a complete divorce between researchers in the two countries, pointing to academic exchanges and sharing of best practices as means for collaboration at lower levels. “The researchers are still friends, they will borrow ideas from each other,” he said.“It’s not Chinese or American. I think all the companies will tend to think of their core business and how they can integrate with AI,” Lee said. Comparing the integrated AI systems of the future to Microsoft’s Windows and Google’s Android, the VC chief said the AI 2.0 change will be a more radical transformation than the mobile era and vast prizes await the companies able to establish the definitive next-generation platforms.“All these giants stand to gain a lot because the way in which this technology can connect to their existing product line and users is not difficult,” he said. “It’s in fact quite trivial.” Alibaba might see better click-throughs on its AI-enriched e-commerce outlets or ByteDance Ltd. could supercharge TikTok’s appeal with AI-generated video.Market Mania for Everything AI Faces China, Google Reality CheckStill, the US retains a significant lead, in part because its companies got started earlier and in part because they have better data with which to train their AI models — which determine exactly how useful a chatbot or content-generating tool will be.“I’ve tried a few of these so-called Chinese ChatGPTs. I would say they’re not as good as ChatGPT,” Lee said. He pins the difference on the English-language services having more and higher-quality data than what is available to Chinese contenders. But “on the technologies, I was quite impressed by a few companies.”It will take “maybe a year” for Chinese firms to get an equal or potentially larger amount of data, according to Lee. “China remains the hardest-working, most tenacious execution and value creator.”As to who the eventual winners will be, Lee said startups looking to break through and outpace the bigger-budget incumbents must do two things.“One is build everything AI-first, not mobility-first, not Windows-first, not-PC first. Secondly, leverage the power of open and the power of free,” he said, suggesting that open-source and free software has the chance for widest adoption. “But this is not for the ordinary startup, right? So we’ll have to see what company has that aspiration, experience and the guts to try to build something really, really big in an AI-first platform.”--With assistance from Stephen Engle.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight TrainsTrump’s Tariffs Couldn’t Save the California Olive IndustryPumping Heat a Mile Underground Is Helping One City Cut CarbonFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhones©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Paychex was able to grow its EPS at 11% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 20% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Paychex's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Paychex's TSR for the last 3 years was 86%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 11% received by Paychex shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -10%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?Or Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300,000 last year?Some savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant, formerly Phillip Morris International Inc., has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.But there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterThe Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street DarlingMonster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.Yet this energy drink company returned 87,560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.Why was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?Part of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.But there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022, its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.To keep the lights on, Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast, Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.Story continuesIt turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference, compounded over the years, means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.A similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC, it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?Sure enough, $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance, but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020, or less that 10% of what Apple paid.See Next: For investors looking to invest in startups in the beverage space, Trubrain also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable, but with just $17 million in sales since 2012, is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.Read More in Startup News &amp; Investing Opportunities: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using ItCollaborative Robots Startup Using Teams Of AI-Powered Drones To Make Flying SaferThe World's First Floating Lifestyle Club is Set To Launch This YearDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

79,0f505f0b-e119-3da0-88c2-75c10457d5e3,LUV,2023-03-15,Southwest is adding deicing trucks after December breakdown,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-adding-deicing-trucks-december-160448858.html,1678809888,STORY,['LUV'],"[The CEO of Southwest Airlines pushed back Tuesday against the view that his airline’s December breakdown was caused by a failure to invest enough money in crew-scheduling technology, instead blaming extremely cold weather that forced it to stop flying at some airports.Southwest said it is buying more deicing trucks and lining up additional deicing pads at key airports and buying more engine covers and heaters to avoid a repeat.The airline also said it will increase staffing during extremely cold weather, and it will improve phone systems for customers and employees.A severe winter storm just before Christmas affected all airlines, but Southwest struggled far more than the others to recover. It wound up canceling nearly 17,000 flights in 10 days before resuming a normal schedule. Unions for pilots and flight attendants said technology used to reassign crews to planes bogged down, and workers spent hours on hold when they called headquarters for instructions.Robert Jordan said the entire debacle could be traced to Southwest’s inability to keep flying in extremely cold weather at key airports including Denver and Chicago Midway.“I do not think we have a chronic underinvestment in technology,” he said at a JPMorgan investor conference. He repeated a previous estimate that the Dallas company will spend more than $1.3 billion on information technology this year.Jordan also defended the airline's business model against critics who say its point-to-point route map makes it more vulnerable to flight disruptions that start in one part of the country — caused by bad weather, for example — and then ripple across the network.The frozen conditions in Denver and Chicago started the mess, he said, “and it would have caused the issue no matter what the network structure was.”Southwest said in a filing that it continues to expect to report a loss for the first quarter, with lingering fallout from the December crisis cutting revenue by up to $350 million. That is on top of an $800 million drop in fourth-quarter pretax income that Southwest attributed to the meltdown, which is being investigated by federal officials.Shares of Southwest rose about 1% in midday trading.]"
80,82f43cdc-f68e-334b-b962-b9201d82ce6a,LUV,2023-03-15,Is Southwest (LUV) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-luv-buy-wall-street-133001410.html,1678800601,STORY,['LUV'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Southwest Airlines (LUV).Southwest currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.86, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.86 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 57.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for LUVBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for LUVCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Southwest here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Southwest, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is LUV Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Southwest, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 1.2% over the past month to $2.71.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Southwest. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Southwest with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business. The company also expects the aerospace division to experience revenue growth at a mid-to-high single digit rate and generate free cash flow equivalent to its net income in the same period. According to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), the combined power-equipment and renewable energy units are expected to experience mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit margins, despite the current challenges faced by the wind turbine business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has also reconfirmed its financial targets for 2023, which include more than doubling its adjusted earnings and generating up to $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesAir travel was expected to make a major comeback in 2023, with China reopening, airlines increasing the number of flights and airports hiring more staff to handle the expected surge in demand. However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

Although Textron's DEFIANT X aircraft surpassed Lockheed Martin’s and Boeing’s offering in the competition, Liwag noted that the losing parties could potentially contest the award decision, leading to additional delays until the matter is resolved. Despite this uncertainty, the analyst maintained an Overweight rating and a $84 price target on Textron Inc.

Notable strength in the Axon Cloud segment reflects increased domestic demand for software-heavy premium integrated bundles. We believe the company has a line of sight to a more than 20% average annual revenue growth, an improving margin profile with software solutions growth, and the potential to become the dominant ecosystem in the public safety space.”9. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was founded in 1885 and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Zevenbergen Capital Investments is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 551,594 shares worth $91.5 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments has to say about Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included industrials, Honeywell also lagged in the quarter after previously generating strong returns over extended periods.”8. L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:LHX), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“We also exited our position in L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris’ recent quarterly results showed some pandemic-related impact on the company’s business, though relative to other industrials stocks, the effect has been quite modest, and it is achieving ahead-of-schedule synergies from its recent merger. However, concerns about ballooning federal deficits and potential associated defense-budget cuts have been a headwind. We share these concerns, and with the company’s market cap above the mid-cap range, we concluded our campaign to fund newer profit cycle opportunities.”7.

Industrial output rose 2.4% and fixed-asset investment grew strongly, as local governments increased infrastructure spending to spur the recovery. However, the unemployment rate increased, pointing to weakness in domestic demand.The numbers were broadly in line with economists estimates and came after Beijing signaled that it would provide a similar fiscal stimulus to the economy as last year, betting on consumers to drive the recovery. Economists said the data was consistent with China meeting it’s target of around 5% GDP growth this year, a significant boost to global demand as the US and European economies face recession fears.The data is “pointing to a steady rather than accelerating momentum, which also indicates strong policy support is needed to unleash the growth potential,” said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International Holdings. “The relatively high jobless rate seems to suggest that the further recovery of consumption will hinge on policy dynamics,” he said.The two-month data may not fully reflect recent strength in consumer spending, as it includes January when China was hit by a wave of coronavirus infections that followed the government’s sudden ending of Covid restrictions the previous month. Cases apparently peaked ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, prompting people to travel and spend again. Factories also benefited as workforce shortages due to Covid eased.Story continuesThe value of new apartment sales over the period rose 3.5% on-year, compared with a 22% slump in the first two months of 2022. That recovery from a low base is a sign that Beijing’s financial support for the property sector is taking effect following a deep real estate slump which has lasted for more than a year. However, residential property investment fell 4.6%, meaning better sales are not yet leading to growth in housing investment which economists estimate drives up to 20% of demand in China’s economy.Beijing has refrained from providing cash stimulus to households, betting that a pick up in hiring by companies will boost wages and spending. However, China’s official urban unemployment rate rose to 5.6% from 5.5% in December, and the jobless rate for young people jumped to a six-month high of 18.1%.“The problem of insufficient demand is still prominent. The economy’s foundation for rebounding is not yet secured,” the statistics bureau said in a statement.The bureau combines the data releases for the two months of January and February to avoid distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month in different years.Chinese stocks held on to their strong opening gains after the data as equity markets in the region recovered from recent losses triggered by concerns about the health of the US banking system. China’s CSI 300 Index of stocks rose 0.4% as of the midday break while futures contract on 10-year bonds fell 0.1%. The yuan was little changed.The pickup in retail sales was driven by spending on medicine, petroleum products and catering, while automobile purchases slumped, according to the official data. Industrial output was driven by steel, coal and renewable energy equipment.“This probably reinforces the view that even if we have a sequential upswing on China rebound on the back of the reopening, it’s not going to be like a big boom,” Johanna Chua, chief Asia Pacific economist at Citigroup Global Markets, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.The spillover benefits of China’s rebound on other emerging markets will “be much more limited,” than in previous economic cycles, Chua said. “It’s really going to be more on the travel, tourist-depending economies around Southeast Asia,” she added.Stronger InvestmentThe investment acceleration was driven by state-owned companies. Local governments boosted sales of special bonds to more than 800 billion yuan ($116 billion) in the first two months of the year to front-load spending in infrastructure. The issuance accounts for over a fifth of this year’s total allowance of 3.8 trillion yuan for such debt.What Bloomberg Economics Says...China’s first comprehensive set of “hard” data for the first two months of the year show the recovery is well underway — but isn’t as eye-popping as early survey data suggested. Retail sales swung back to growth, and industrial output accelerated. But the biggest driver was infrastructure investment — raising the risk that the growth spurt is overly dependent on government support.For the full report, click hereChang Shu and David QuBeijing set a relatively modest target for gross domestic product growth of around 5% for this year, signaling it will avoid any big stimulus through infrastructure investment or the property market. However, a fairly ambitious job creation goal of “around 12 million” suggests policy will remain supportive.China’s new Premier Li Qiang said Monday the growth target “is not an easy task“ and “requires redoubled efforts.” The nation will prioritize stability in growth, prices and jobs, he said.Earlier on Wednesday, the central bank boosted net cash injections into the financial system by the most since December 2020, providing banks with additional liquidity as demand for loans picks up.The economy is expected to grow 5.3% this year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, mainly driven by consumer spending. However, a number of risks cloud the outlook, including waning global demand, a struggling property market and rising geopolitical tensions.“We expect China’s growth momentum to improve further in coming months, driven mainly by the ongoing consumption recovery and still-accommodative macro policy,” Goldman Sachs economists said in a note on the data.--With assistance from Yujing Liu, Jing Zhao and Tom Hancock.(Updates with more details in third paragraph, economist’s comment.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNaples, Florida, Sees a Rush of New Money—But City Workers Are Getting Priced OutThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyFree IRS TurboTax Competitor Is Closer After Biden FundingThe German Startup Racing Uber to Uber-ize TrucksThe Digital Age Ushers in a Speedier, More Viral Breed of Bank Run©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Undoubtedly, Silicon Valley Bank's failure happened very quickly, with the collapse occurring in a time span of around two days. The pace of the bank's demise was startling to market participants, many of whom may have been too quick to rid their portfolios of banks.Indeed, it's not an easy time to be a bank investor. It never is in the face of economic contractions, given banks tend to feel all the pains that come with a waning economy. With Silicon Valley Bank being seized by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), it's easy to view it as one of the first dominoes to fall. Bank runs often tend to be driven by fear. With rapidly-rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession, there is no shortage of investor worry these days.GS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GSPeter Lynch Chart of GSEven as the Silicon Valley Bank scare sparks a flight for safety, recent jitters seem less likely to cause a repeat of what happened during the Great Financial Crisis, in my view. For those who lived and invested through 2008, it's a nervous time to be in bank stocks. However, the fall of Silicon Valley Bank seems largely company-specific.Silicon Valley Bank was without a chief risk officer for quite some time. As the bank took on more risk in an attempt to score more yield, it put itself in the blast zone of the rapid-fire rate hikes by acquiring the vast majority of its Treasury bonds at near-zero interest rates. In essence, Silicon Valley Bank seemed to have been picking up a few dimes scattered in front of a freight train moving in at full speed. The results were devastating.Silicon Valley Bank gets a quick backstop, but investors are still rattledThankfully for startups, the U.S. government backstopped Silicon Valley Bank's deposits, and the bank is back to ""business as usual,"" as newly-appointed top boss Tim Mayopoulos said. That was very swift action taken by the federal government, and it's likely to help put many banking customers, including those without Silicon Valley Bank deposits, at ease, albeit only slightly.Story continuesBank investors still have a bad taste in their mouths. And there's some concern that reliance on backstops can incentivize risky behavior. In any case, U.S. (and even Canadian) bank stocks remained under pressure in a turbulent session of trade on Monday.Though contagion jitters are less intense than they were on Friday, many investors seem to be in no rush to get back into the big bank stocks, even those with impressive capital reserves. Indeed, brave investors looking for value may have a shot now that big U.S. bank stocks are down considerably in just a week.Goldman Sachs: A great bank worth another look after a week of volatilityGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is just one of many big, established banks that got caught up in the past few days of selling. At the time of writing, the stock is down nearly 12% in the past week and off around 25% from its 2021 all-time high of nearly $420. The past week of selling seems excessive, especially given the likelihood that Silicon Valley Bank's fall seems unlikely to spark some sort of financial crisis. At this juncture, pundits like UBS chief investment officer Mark Hackett do not see the stage set for any sort of contagion.For large, well-run banks with diversified client bases, the relative isolation of Silicon Valley Bank's fall could mean last week's bank flop is more of a buying opportunity than a sign to run for the hills. After the latest slide, Goldman Sachs stock boasts a price-earnings ratio of 10.96 alongside a 2.92% dividend yield. While the plunge may have yet to conclude, the value proposition has gotten a whole lot sweeter in recent months.Even if Silicon Valley Bank is less of an issue than many think, Goldman isn't without its own issues. The company's latest quarter was dragged down by the overly-conservative climate, with less in the way of investment banking activity. Looking ahead, macro headwinds could continue to weigh down the capital markets division, all while the company looks to take its foot off the gas of its consumer banking division. Indeed, its consumer banking venture didn't get off to the start management wanted.Goldman Sachs' Investor Day highlightsAnother few quarters of pain could be in the cards for the investment banking behemoth. Still, management recently set some goalposts in its latest Investor Day presentation. Most notably, Goldman seeks returns on tangible common equity of 15-17% well above the initial 13%. The company also sees asset and wealth management as one of its key areas to focus on.Sure, it would have been nice to see Goldman thrive in its consumer-facing push. However, it doesn't need Marcus to land the perfect mix of efficiencies and growth in a post-recession economy.Final thoughtsSilicon Valley Bank has sunk nearly everything in banking over the last few tradomg sessions. Goldman Sachs is one of many large banking plays that probably didn't deserve to be punished so harshly last week in my opinion. Though the company has its own challenges, I see the valuation as very enticing.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance. So, let's now take a look at the banks which are now looking over their shoulder, starting with:25. Popular, Inc.

OPK announced that its company, ModeX Therapeutics, Inc., has entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). The tie-up is aimed at developing ModeX’s preclinical nanoparticle vaccine candidate targeting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), MDX-2201.Per the agreement terms, OPKO Health will receive an upfront payment of $50 million and is eligible for milestone payments associated with progress in the development and commercialization of MDX-2201 as well as royalties on global sales.The latest collaboration is expected to significantly boost OPKO Health’s Pharmaceutical business on a global scale.Rationale Behind the PartnershipPer OPKO Health, EBV is the leading cause of infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with some specific types of cancer. Per management, the collaboration with Merck is expected to enable the development of a vaccine against EBV, a virus that takes a significant toll on human health globally. Hence, management believes that by targeting four proteins used by EBV to infect cells, the vaccine candidate represents the multitargeting approach developed by ModeX.OPKO Health’s management also feels that the acquisition of ModeX (completed in May 2022) has enabled it to broaden its technology foundation and expand its product pipeline into new therapeutic areas.Merck’s management expects to apply its experience and expertise to assess the potential of MDX-2201 to help protect against EBV infection and other potentially-related conditions.Industry ProspectsPer a report by BCC Research, the global market for nanoparticles in biotechnology, drug development and drug delivery is expected to increase from $83.4 billion in 2020 to $123.6 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 8.2%.

OPKO Health also confirmed that Pfizer is currently expecting to launch in all priority ex-U.S. markets by the year’s end and is continuing to work with the FDA to obtain approval in the United States.

NXGN is well-poised for growth, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with continued demand for its solutions, is expected to contribute further. NextGen’s dependence on third-party partners and stiff competition pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 14.2% compared with a 35.4% decline of the industry and 11% fall of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned global provider of innovative and cloud-based healthcare technology solutions has a market capitalization of $1.11 billion.

NextGen’s Inpatient Clinicals, Lab and Patient Portal EHR solutions have also been gaining considerable traction.Last month, NextGen announced that Compass Health Network had chosen NextGen Behavioral Health Suite to provide whole-person care.Strong Q3 Results: NextGen’s solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, including the year-over-year uptick in the top line, buoy optimism. Strength in Recurring revenues and robust increases in Subscription services, Managed services, and Transactional and data services revenues in the quarter were encouraging. The improvement in Other non-recurring services revenues was also promising. The buyout of TSI Healthcare also looks promising for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesDependence on Third-Party Partners: NextGen is subject to several risks associated with having a portion of its assets and operations located in India and by using third-party service providers in India and other countries. Various factors, such as changes in the current Government of India, could trigger significant changes in India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and NextGen’s business in particular.Stiff Competition: The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive and NextGen faces significant competition from various sources. Several of its competitors have substantially greater resources, while some of the larger competitors have greater scale than NextGen. Transaction induced pressures or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could adversely affect NextGen’s business.Estimate TrendNextGen is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023.

In that same time, the Consumer Discretionary sector lost 8.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.68%.Netflix will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Netflix to post earnings of $2.81 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 20.4%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.18 billion, up 3.92% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.18 per share and revenue of $34.15 billion, which would represent changes of +12.36% and +8.02%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

103,ece95baa-0d76-3c9a-980a-19e991d98128,PSX,2023-03-15,Phillips 66 (PSX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-trending-stock-130001267.html,1678798801,STORY,['PSX'],"[Phillips 66 (PSX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -11.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has lost 8.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $3.75 per share, indicating a change of +184.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.57 points to a change of -17.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.52 indicates a change of -13.2% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $144.74 billion and $130.42 billion estimates indicate -17.6% and -9.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $40.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.9%. EPS of $4 for the same period compares with $2.94 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +19.26%. The EPS surprise was -7.83%.Over the last four quarters, Phillips 66 surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,cccbe70f-985b-3e49-943f-9f67919cf3cb,AMGN,2023-03-15,25 Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-biggest-pharmaceutical-companies-world-022005023.html,1678846805,STORY,"['PFE', 'AMGN', 'TEVA', 'TAK']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world.There is no need to emphasize the value of the pharmaceutical industry after the Covid-19 pandemic. Without the immediate advancements that pharma companies came up with to developed the Covid-19 vaccine, it is very likely that the world would still be fighting the pandemic which in two years devastated the global economy. The development of vaccines by some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world at a pace that surprised every single person led the inoculation of hundreds of millions worldwide and brought an early end to the pandemic.Even though pharmaceutical indexes, including the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF, recorded a total return of -4.78% in 2022, this return has been better than the S&amp;P 500 index return of -19.44% in the same time period. Even though a negative return seems to indicate an industry floundering, the truth is that U.S. shares have suffered greatly as a result of rising inflation and interest rates, while the threat of an imminent recession did not help matters. Hence, comparing returns from pharmaceutical indexes to S&amp;P 500 returns provides a more accurate picture, one that shows pharma companies performed well above the average.25 biggest pharmacuetical companies in the worldadriaticfoto/Shutterstock.comThe 2023 outlook for the pharma industry seems quite interesting. According to PwC, areas of activity in 2023 will focus on high growth opportunities, which means that mergers and acquisitions will focus more on oncology and immunology, while other areas including vaccines, cardiovascular diseases and central nervous systems diseases will also be areas of focus. In 2022, the total value of merger and acquisition deals was $158.5 billion, a significant fall of around 40% vs 2021 with the biggest such deal being the $30 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics by Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). The greatest value in the pharma industry lies in developing solutions for unmet medical needs for which the market will place a premium. The aforementioned decrease in M&amp;A shows headwinds being faced by the medtech sector while uneven capital market performance hasn't helped the situation. Deals have always been a major part of the pharma industry and despite the area stagnating in 2022, the expectation is that deals will continue to increase in 2023 as inorganic growth is still expected to drive overall growth.Story continuesMeanwhile, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) lost out on its bid for Horizon Therapeutics but the pharma giant, which is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, is purchasing Provention Bio, a pharma company specializing in diabetes, for $2.5 billion, at $25 per share in cash, which brings us to another interesting point; cash is king in the pharma industry as the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world are taking advantage of biotech companies hemorrhaging cash, mainly because of an IPO slump in the previous year and an impending recession leaving little options to raise cash. As many biotech companies are facing cashflow issues, the competition for private funding is higher and public markets are basically closed off for them, getting offers from pharmaceutical companies seems to be the only option for these companies. Since cashflow is an issue, most biotech companies prefer purchases in cash as opposed to the traditional method of buying a company in exchange for shares or a combination of shares and cash.Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of Seagen, an oncology focused biotech company, for $43 billion, as the pharma giant has used its extra earnings and profits from its successful Covid-19 vaccine to ramp up purchases. Not only does this give Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) a huge advantage in a segment which is considered to be the future of pharma, it also allows the company to substitute this purchase for its R&amp;D expense. When a company acquires another company, the purchase price isn't taken to the profit and loss but the balance sheet, which means it doesn't impact the net profit of the company. This in turn means that even though this $43 billion purchase is technically an R&amp;D expense for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), by purchasing a company, the company's price earnings ratio looks lower and more attractive to investors, since its earnings aren't reduced. ""We aren't acquiring the golden eggs, we are buying the goose that lays the golden eggs,"" said Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO.One of the challenges that the pharmaceutical industry is facing is generics threatening the market share of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, as loss of patents, licenses and trademarks of major revenue generating drugs is allowing generic pharma companies to enter the space and provide drugs at a much lower cost, thus gaining more market share. In many countries, governments are encouraging local generic manufacturers with subsidies and grants as opposed to multinationals to allow residents to purchase cheaper drugs. In the next decade, pharma companies are expected to lose billions of dollars in revenue while there isn't enough in R&amp;D pipelines to offset this revenue loss completely, which is another reason why M&amp;A rule the pharma world.Another area that has seen further developments in recent years is the HIV segment. While HIV has existed for decades now, there are some exciting changes in the area, with a third person becoming free of HIV after receiving virus-resistant cells, though the risks linked to the procedures mean that widespread treatment is still unlikely for the foreseeable future. In addition, while traditionally HIV pills have been required to be ingested every single day or even multiple dosages a day, advancements in drugs have allowed the development of new PrEP medication which significantly reduces a person's dosage to just every other month, with three companies having PrEP drugs approved by the CDC for usage.According to Fitch, the outlook for the pharma sector is neutral as despite inflationary measures and higher interest rates, a supportive operating environment still remains. Meanwhile IQVIA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:IQV), which provides data on the health information and clinical research, stated that the Covid-19 pandemic's beneficial impact to the pharmaceutical industry is expected to add $500 billion to the industry from 2020 to 2027, with the biggest growths expected in Africa, Latin America and Asia, due to greater excess, higher demand and an increasing population. Meanwhile, low growth is expected in the U.S. and Europe, which for most of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are their biggest markets. Biotech is also the biggest thing in pharma right now, which is why it's worth getting a head-start in this space by considering the most undervalued biotech stocks.The biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world have a combined market cap exceeding $3.5 trillion, while their trailing twelve month (TTM revenue) exceeds $1 trillion. To determine these companies, we checked their latest market cap and TTM from Yahoo finance, with our rankings based on their average ranking for both criteria.

JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.Banks are struggling after the Federal Reserves fastest series of rate hikes in decades caused prices of assets on their balance sheets to decline.In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pointed to prior eras of rising rates that led to “spectacular financial flameouts,” such as the years' long savings and loan crisis.“We don’t know yet whether the consequences of easy money and regulatory changes will cascade throughout the U.S. regional banking sector (akin to the S&amp;L Crisis) with more seizures and shutdowns coming,” he wrote.Stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates at its meeting next week or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling. But inflation at 6% in February still is well above the Fed's 2% target.Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries.One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond, or the difference between its market price and the payout at maturity, narrowed by an unusually wide margin to 3.89% from Tuesday's 4.25% as prices rose.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 39 cents to $68.00 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

When times get tough or the economy faces severe inflationary pressures, some investors turn to silver to hedge their bets or to invest more defensively. Silver prices spiked in March 2023 following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, as concerns were raised about the stability of the financial system.Investors like silver for many reasons, but many see it as a store of value in uncertain times, while others see silver and other precious metals such as gold as protection against inflation. For this latter group, investing in silver is a way to be sure that they have a currency that can’t be inflated away by money printing or potentially destructive Federal Reserve policy.There are a number of ways to invest in silver, from owning it outright to owning shares in companies that produce it. Here are five of the best ways to invest in silver.5 popular ways to buy and sell silverEach of the ways to invest in silver comes with its own risks and rewards.1. Coins or bullionOwning physical silver, either as coins or bullion, is a psychologically and emotionally satisfying way to invest in silver. You have possession of it and can use it, if necessary. And in some cases, it’s actually relatively easy to access. For example, U.S. coins made before 1964 contain about 90 percent silver, and you can purchase them at the value of their silver content.If the price of silver rises, you can make a profit on silver coins and bullion, but that’s the only way you’ll make money here, since the physical commodity does not produce cash flow, unlike a quality business.You can purchase silver through local dealers and pawn shops or online dealers such as APMEX or JM Bullion. More specialized dealers allow you to purchase whole bars rather than just coins.Risks: It can be easy to overpay for physical silver, so be sure to note the spot price to ensure that you’re getting a fair price. Similarly, if you need cash in a hurry, you may not be able to get the full value for your physical silver, especially if you need to go through a dealer.Story continuesWatch out if you’re buying collectible coins, since you’ll likely pay extra for the collectibility of the coin, meaning that you’re overpaying for the actual silver content. Finally, like all physical assets, silver is subject to theft, so you’ll have to safeguard it and maybe even insure it.2. Silver futuresSilver futures are an easy way to wager on the rising or falling price of silver without any of the hassles of owning physical silver. You could even take physical delivery of the silver, though that’s not the typical motivation of those speculating in the futures markets.Silver futures are an attractive way to play the silver market because of the high amount of leverage available in futures contracts. In other words, you have to put up relatively little capital to own a relatively large position in the metal. If silver futures move in the right direction, you’ll make a lot of money very quickly, though you can lose it just as quickly if you’re wrong.Risks: The leverage in future contracts works both ways, meaning it magnifies your gains and your losses. If the market moves against you, you’ll have to put up more money to hold the position. And if you can’t, the broker will close out the position and you’ll be stuck with a loss.Futures are risky, and they’re more suitable for sophisticated traders. You’ll usually need a large account balance to get started, too. Finally, only some online brokers offer futures trading.3. ETFs that own silverIf you don’t want to own physical silver directly but also want a lower-risk method than futures, you can buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that owns physical silver. You’ll have the potential reward for owning silver if the price rises, but fewer risks such as theft. An ETF that owns physical silver will deliver the return of silver prices minus the ETF’s expense ratio.ETFs offer another advantage, too. You’ll be able to sell your silver at the market price, and the funds are highly liquid. So you’ll be able to sell your funds at what’s likely the best price, and you can do so on any day the stock market is open.The two main ETFs owning physical silver are iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF (SIVR). Traders can also wager on the silver market via an ETF that owns futures contracts through ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ), though it’s better as a short-term bet than a long-term hold, because of how the fund is structured.Risks: Like gold and other commodities, silver can be volatile, especially over short periods. But with an ETF you’ll be able to dodge some of the bigger risks of owning physical silver yourself, namely the risk of theft, the illiquidity and the poor pricing when it’s time to trade.4. Silver mining stocksYou can also take advantage of a rising silver market by owning the stocks of companies that mine the metal.By owning a miner you can benefit in two ways. First, if the price of silver rises, the company’s earnings should rise along with it. In fact, silver miners’ profits will rise faster than the price of silver, all else equal. Second, the miner can raise production over time, also increasing its profits. That’s an extra way to win with silver, over and above just betting on the price itself.Risks: Any time you invest in an individual company, it’s important to do extensive analysis on it, to be sure that you’re buying a high-quality company that can succeed. Many miners are risky outfits, and some have yet to dig a hole in the ground, let alone mine silver from it. Plus, because their profits depend on the volatile price of silver, mining stocks can be volatile, too.5. ETFs that own silver minersIf you’re not looking to do a lot of analysis on silver miners but still want the advantages of owning a mining company, you can turn to an ETF that owns silver miners. You’ll get diversified exposure to miners and lower risk than owning one or two individual mining stocks.Three ETFs are classified as silver miners, according to ETF Database: Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (SLVP) and ETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ).Risks: A sector ETF reduces the costs of any single miner doing poorly, but anything that hits the whole industry, such as a falling price of silver, will likely ding the fund significantly. And pay close attention to what’s in those funds, since they’re not all created equal. Some may offer more exposure to higher-quality companies, while others focus more on riskier junior miners.Is silver a good investment?Investors like silver for many of the same reasons that they like gold and precious metals more generally. Here are some of the most important reasons:Returns: Over certain periods of time silver has outperformed highly regarded asset classes such as stocks.A store of value: Silver can hold its value and even gain over time, providing a way for investors to generate profits.Liquidity: Silver is generally a liquid market, and if you’re buying certain kinds of silver assets, they’re highly liquid.Less correlated to asset markets: Part of silver’s appeal is that its less correlated to other markets such as stocks, meaning it can act as a hedge against those markets.Diversification: Because the metal is less correlated, silver can act as a way to diversify a portfolio, reducing risks and potentially increasing returns.Of course, silver is not without risks or drawbacks.Silver itself does not produce cash flow, so it may not be clear when it’s a good time to buy. That’s in contrast to stocks, where the underlying company may be cheap based on its earnings or future prospects.Second, because silver doesn’t produce cash flow like a business, investors looking to profit must rely exclusively on someone else paying more for the precious metal than they did. In contrast, owners of a business – through either individual stocks or ETFs – can profit through the rising price of the commodity or the increased earnings of the business. So those who have a stake in these types of businesses have multiple ways to win with silver.Is now a good time to invest in silver?Investors can consider investing in silver in a variety of scenarios:Supply and demand are out of touch: If the supply of silver is not keeping up with demand, it may cause the price of silver to rise.An attractively priced company becomes available: If you find a company that’s ramping up production or is able to take advantage of rising silver prices, it could be a good time to buy.You need a hedge against inflation: Some investors turn to commodities such as silver as a way to hedge against inflationYou want to hedge your portfolio: If you have significant exposure to rising silver prices in your portfolio (for example, silver is a major input for your businesses), you could buy silver and help offset that exposure.You want to add commodities to your portfolio: Silver can be part of an allocation to commodities in your portfolio, helping to diversify your holdings and lower your risk.While adding silver to your portfolio can be a useful strategy for more advanced investors, beginners may be better served by building a well-rounded portfolio made up of the best investments.Bottom lineInvesting in silver is not a good fit for everyone, and some investors prefer to focus on cash-flowing businesses rather than invest in the metal itself. Investors in businesses have multiple ways to win, and it’s why super-investors such as Warren Buffett prefer businesses over commodities.It’s easier and less costly to own stocks or ETFs than physical silver, even as they’re more liquid than the actual shiny stuff. Still, owning bullion means you have no counterparty risk (with an exchange or a company, for instance), though the investment relies only on you for safekeeping.Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business. The company also expects the aerospace division to experience revenue growth at a mid-to-high single digit rate and generate free cash flow equivalent to its net income in the same period. According to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), the combined power-equipment and renewable energy units are expected to experience mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit margins, despite the current challenges faced by the wind turbine business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has also reconfirmed its financial targets for 2023, which include more than doubling its adjusted earnings and generating up to $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesAir travel was expected to make a major comeback in 2023, with China reopening, airlines increasing the number of flights and airports hiring more staff to handle the expected surge in demand. However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyPhoto by NASA on UnsplashBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy12. Howmet Aerospace Inc.

Although Textron's DEFIANT X aircraft surpassed Lockheed Martin’s and Boeing’s offering in the competition, Liwag noted that the losing parties could potentially contest the award decision, leading to additional delays until the matter is resolved. Despite this uncertainty, the analyst maintained an Overweight rating and a $84 price target on Textron Inc.

We believe the company has a line of sight to a more than 20% average annual revenue growth, an improving margin profile with software solutions growth, and the potential to become the dominant ecosystem in the public safety space.”9. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was founded in 1885 and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is a global technology and manufacturing firm with diverse operations. Honeywell International Inc.

(NASDAQ:HON), compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Zevenbergen Capital Investments is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 551,594 shares worth $91.5 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments has to say about Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included industrials, Honeywell also lagged in the quarter after previously generating strong returns over extended periods.”8. L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:LHX), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“We also exited our position in L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris’ recent quarterly results showed some pandemic-related impact on the company’s business, though relative to other industrials stocks, the effect has been quite modest, and it is achieving ahead-of-schedule synergies from its recent merger. However, concerns about ballooning federal deficits and potential associated defense-budget cuts have been a headwind. We share these concerns, and with the company’s market cap above the mid-cap range, we concluded our campaign to fund newer profit cycle opportunities.”7.

Companies continue to focus on the level of services, staffing with selective amenities and enhanced safety and social-distancing protocols on the gaming floor to welcome gamers. Nevertheless, the easing of restrictions and investment will boost gaming revenues in Macau. In the next 10 years, six casino companies will invest nearly $15 billion.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States is recovering faster than anticipated. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $60.42 billion in 2022. In 2022, sports betting increased 72.7% year over year. Gambling was already flourishing in the United States until the pandemic struck in early 2020. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve.  Sports Betting a Major Driver: The legalization of sports betting in Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Montana, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois and New Hampshire has been driving growth for a while. Bettors can now place wagers via digital platforms in Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and other states. Some popular gaming applications include DraftKings, Barstool, FanDuel, BetMGM, BetRivers, Fox Bet and BetMonarch.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Jan 31, 2023, the industry’s northbound estimate for the current year has increased 1,100%.Industry Outperforms Sector and the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Gaming industry has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector over the past year.The industry has gained 7.8% over this period against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s decline of 11% and the sector’s decrease of 19.2%.One-Year Price PerformanceGaming Industry's Valuation Since gaming companies are debt-laden, valuing the same based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio makes sense. The industry currently has a forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.53. The space is trading at a discount compared to the market at large, as the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 19.71.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.60X and as low as 6.82X, with a median of 10.6X, as the chart below shows.Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)3 Zacks Gaming Stocks to Watch forLas Vegas Sands: Based in Las Vegas, NV, Las Vegas Sands is a leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about NextEra Energy (NEE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.64, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.64 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying NextEra, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NEE Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.12.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is facing concerns about long-term sales growth as Humira generics have entered the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvica's sales.Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressures is hurting the aesthetics franchise's sales. Nonetheless, though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025.However, AbbVie has several new drugs in its portfolio, which have the potential to drive the top line to make up for lost Humira revenues.

COP's balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Additionally, the company announced its 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion.However, ConocoPhillips is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company. Also, the company has been generating lower dividend yield than the industry for the past few years.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for The Bank of New York Mellon CorporationFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this company is expected to earn $4.83 per share, which is a change of 5.2% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance.

The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $5.4 billion.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm.

Thieves removed the devices from as many as 153,000 vehicles in the U.S. in 2022, far more than earlier estimates. CARFAX data scientists reviewed catalytic converter replacements from millions of service and maintenance records to arrive at this number.Carfax logo. (PRNewsFoto/Carfax)Thieves are committing ""opportunistic crimes,"" says Sgt. Matt Casavant with the Maine State Police. ""Parking lots – even ones that were well lit – were getting hit. Car dealerships are getting hit on a regular basis, too. The thieves were so brazen that it didn't matter,"" he said. ""My kid drives a Subaru and I won't let her leave her car overnight at the school or other places because it's a high-value target.""Criminals steal catalytic converters because of the precious metals – platinum, palladium, and rhodium – contained inside each device. Thieves can cut them from beneath vehicles in a matter of seconds, leading to a rude awakening for vehicle owners. Once the converter is removed, not only will the car make a loud noise when started, but it can cost owners thousands of dollars to replace that missing catalytic converter – especially if consumers don't have the right type of car insurance.To help consumers, CARFAX has compiled a nationwide list of the top 2022 targets for these precious-metal thieves:Ford F-Series pickup trucksHonda AccordToyota PriusHonda CR-VFord ExplorerFord Econoline vansChevrolet EquinoxChevrolet SilveradoToyota TacomaChevrolet CruzeDepending on where you're located in the country, certain vehicles are targeted more heavily. We have a breakdown by region here.Car owners looking to prevent catalytic converter theft should:Park in a well-lit area.Park in your garage if possible, instead of in the driveway or on the street.If you must park in a driveway, consider installing motion sensor security lights.Install a catalytic converter anti-theft device.Have a muffler shop etch your vehicle's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the converter and spray it with a highly visible, high-heat paint. Doing so enables law enforcement to track converters, which in turn could lead police to the thieves.Story continuesGone in 66 seconds: See video of a catalytic converter being removed from a vehicle: https://www.carfax.com/press/video-galleryLearn more about catalytic converters and why they're stolen:https://www.carfax.com/blog/catalytic-convertersAbout CARFAXCARFAX, part of S&amp;P Global Mobility, helps millions of people every day confidently shop, buy, service and sell used cars with innovative solutions powered by CARFAX® vehicle history information.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 31.5% loss over the past four weeks.After stumbling significantly over the past few trading days, the trend for AX has reversed. Following the fall-out from the collapse of two S&amp;P 500 companies, investors have regained some confidence in the finance sector amid the steps taken by regulators to avert a full-blown bank run. Moreover, inflation numbers have come out as expected, which has further reinforced investor optimism. These developments drove the AX stock higher in last day’s trading session.This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.2%. Revenues are expected to be $222.66 million, up 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Axos Financial, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.Banks are struggling after the Federal Reserves fastest series of rate hikes in decades caused prices of assets on their balance sheets to decline.In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pointed to prior eras of rising rates that led to “spectacular financial flameouts,” such as the years' long savings and loan crisis.“We don’t know yet whether the consequences of easy money and regulatory changes will cascade throughout the U.S. regional banking sector (akin to the S&amp;L Crisis) with more seizures and shutdowns coming,” he wrote.Stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates at its meeting next week or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling. But inflation at 6% in February still is well above the Fed's 2% target.Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries.One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond, or the difference between its market price and the payout at maturity, narrowed by an unusually wide margin to 3.89% from Tuesday's 4.25% as prices rose.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 39 cents to $68.00 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Pressure on the banking system also saw markets begin pricing in a less hawkish Fed, on bets that the central bank will try to prevent more economic turmoil.U.S. consumer inflation eased as expected in February, data showed on Tuesday, but core inflation unexpectedly rose from the prior month- keeping the pressure on the Fed to tighten policy further.U.S. Treasury yields recovered from a recent rout on Tuesday, pressuring gold prices, while markets were also positioning for a 50 basis point hike by the European Central Bank on Thursday.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,902.18 an ounce, while gold futures sank 0.3% to $1,905.90 an ounce by 20:04 ET (00:04 GMT). Both instruments fell about 0.5% in the prior session.Fed Funds futures prices show that markets are now pricing in a greater possibility of a 25 basis point hike by the Fed, when it meets next week. Moreover, the bank’s signals on future policy will be closely watched in the face of a potential banking crisis.The U.S. government intervened to restore faith in the banking system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But concerns over contagion from the collapse triggered a rout in stock markets, while ratings agency Moody’s also downgraded its outlook on the U.S. banking system, citing a “crisis of confidence” in the sector.Other precious metals retreated on Wednesday, following a series of strong gains. Silver futures fell 1.4% to $21.742 an ounce, while platinum futures fell 0.2% to $988.60 an ounce.Among industrial metals, copper prices retreated further as markets feared that worsening economic conditions could severely dent industrial activity this year, in turn hurting demand for copper.Story continuesCopper futures fell 0.5% to $3.9870 a pound, after tumbling over 1% in the prior session.Focus is now on Chinese industrial production data, due later in the day, for more signs of an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Related ArticlesGold prices retreat from recent highs amid rate hike uncertaintyOil prices bounce back, helped by stronger OPEC outlook for ChinaFake bombs and failed coup: Moldova smolders on border of Russia's war]"

Unlike cities like San Diego that cap the number of permissible vacation rental properties or Lucerne, Switzerland, which bars hosts from renting out their units for more than 90 days annually, the Big Apple requires hosts to be present in the same unit during the stay, and prohibits internal door locks within the unit.Depending on how stringently the law winds up getting enforced — and hosts and platforms have dodged such mandates in the past — this would mean that a host who took a weekend getaway, week-long vacation or owned a second or third home, couldn’t put their properties on the short-term rental market under these circumstances. Big real estate interests and property managers will undoubtably attempt to find loopholes to do business in what Transparent said was the 13th largest U.S. short-term rental market at the end of 2022 as measured by the number of two-bedroom apartments listed as short-term rentals.Panama City Beach, Florida, was the number 1 market with 3,658 two-bedroom apartments on the short-term rental market at the end of 2022 compared with 1,855 in New York City, according to Transparent estimates.New York City opened the host application process March 6, and also gave landlords and apartment managers the ability to apply to place their properties on a Prohibited Buildings List, meaning any rental in the building would be barred.2,362 Prohibited Buildings in the First 9 Days A spokesperson for the New York City Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice told Skift Tuesday that its Office of Special Enforcement “has received approximately 81 host registration applications and 2,362 buildings have been added to the Prohibited Buildings List.”Story continuesWhile the applications to designate a building as barred from short-term rentals is ample, the number of host registration applications to date — about nine per day — is paltry.While the City is adding to its list of buildings where short-term rentals would be barred, based on building manager applications, Airbnb is attempting to sign up multifamily buildings in a variety of geographies, and is building tools for property managers to handle short-term rentals in their buildings.Owners and other hosts need to prove to the City that their lease or building doesn’t bar short-term rentals to get registered with they city, and they are subject to as much $5,000 fines per infraction for flouting the law. Starting at an unspecified date in July, the City would levy $1,500 fines per infraction against short-term rental platforms that take illegal bookings so they would need to verify the host is registered.The City is in the process of creating a verification tool for short-term rental platforms, and they don’t have to begin verifying hosts until July, the spokesperson said.One public policy executive who declined to be identified characterized the July enforcement deadline as “the next inflection point in NYC.”“For years, Airbnb and our host community have tried to work with the City to develop a regulatory framework that targets illegal hotel operators and protects everyday New Yorkers who share their home, but those pleas have gone unanswered and now thousands of responsible hosts will effectively be prohibited from hosting because of a complicated registration process that was designed to be a de facto ban,” said Nathan Rotman, Airbnb public policy lead. “We will continue to work with the [Mayor Eric] Adams administration to urge for changes that allow hosts to share their home and to simplify the registration process.”Short-term rental platforms would welcome the City loosening up local restrictions on hosting, but after a multiyear battle over various legislation that appears unlikely.Expedia and its Vrbo unit, meanwhile, are working with the city on implementation and host education to promote compliance before the July deadline.Have you ever booked an Airbnb in a building that bars such rentals, and the host advised you to tell any inquiring residents that you are actually the host’s cousin or uncle? You can expect plenty of such bootleg rentals in New York City in the coming months.In BriefLuxury Vacation Rental Market Is On a RollCan anything stop demand from the 1 or 2 percent in the luxury vacation rental market? Absent bank runs and other economic chaos, many of the truly affluent seem to be immune from such pressures. SkiftAirbnb Mulls Launching Sponsored Listings. DuhAirbnb admittedly has had lots of other priorities since the advent of Covid-19, but it seemingly has ignored a ready opportunity to launch sponsored listings. Skift Research estimated Airbnb could see $1.2 billion in revenue annually by 2026 if it went the sponsored listings route.

The contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the DealValued at $48.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed will provide AEGIS with sustainment engineering, software development, in-service maintenance, integration, and logistics and fielding support.These support services are meant for AEGIS’ combat system configurations that are already delivered or will be delivered shortly to the Navy fleet.Majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Moorestown, NJ.Importance of AEGISThe Aegis Combat System is the U.S. Navy’s most modern surface combat system and has been designed as a complete set-up, most suitable for military missions. It includes the missile launching element, the computer programs, the radar and the displays that are fully integrated to work together.Due to the system’s remarkable features that are well-suited for any military mission, Lockheed Martin continues to witness a steady inflow of orders involving the AEGIS combat system. The latest contract win is a testament to the same. Such contract wins should bolster LMT’s revenues from the combat system.Growth ProspectsThe Russia-Ukraine warfare has led many nations to increase their defense spending for strengthening their security. With arsenals and ammunitions forming an integral part of an efficient combat system, defense products have been witnessing a surge in demand lately. In this context, the demand for an efficient security system that can strengthen naval sea warfare capabilities may also increase in the future.Per Mordor Intelligence projections, the global naval combat system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% over the 2022-2027 period. Such projections further exemplify Lockheed Martin’s immense opportunities to capitalize on the expanding market with its state-of-the-art combat system.Such abounding growth projections will also benefit prominent defense majors like Raytheon Technologies RTX, BAE Systems BAESY and Elbit Systems ESLT, as these stocks have strong presence in the naval combat space.Raytheon Technologies’ Missiles &amp; Defense unit provides an integrated range of solutions in naval warfare, ranging from sensors to command and control systems to precision weapons. It serves as the prime mission systems equipment integrator for all electronic and combat systems for the DDG 1000 program, America’s next-generation combat ship.The company provides the warship with a computing environment, electronic modular enclosures, an integrated undersea warfare set-up, an MK57 vertical launching structure, an advanced gun system and an integrated power set-up.BAE Systems designs and manufactures naval ships, submarines, and state-of-the-art combat systems and equipment. Its INTeACT combat management system provides mission-critical capabilities and a vital defense advantage.Story continuesThe system also provides warship crew with all the information it needs to track, analyze and respond to threats in combat. It also allows the troop to co-ordinate resources in other operations such as intelligence gathering and humanitarian assistance, both independently as well as part of multinational coalitions.Elbit Systems has more than three decades of experience in designing and development of high-performance naval combat systems, including shipboard combat management systems. This assures information dominance over potential enemies, supporting a Common Tactical Picture, shortening decision cycles and executing rapid, accurate weapon engagement.The company’s submarine, ELINT systems, can detect and recognize threats under dense electromagnetic conditions. These systems are currently installed on the Israel Navy Dolphin class submarines and are also used by several other navies worldwide.Price MovementShares of Lockheed have gained 6.7% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 13.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business. The company also expects the aerospace division to experience revenue growth at a mid-to-high single digit rate and generate free cash flow equivalent to its net income in the same period. According to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), the combined power-equipment and renewable energy units are expected to experience mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit margins, despite the current challenges faced by the wind turbine business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has also reconfirmed its financial targets for 2023, which include more than doubling its adjusted earnings and generating up to $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesAir travel was expected to make a major comeback in 2023, with China reopening, airlines increasing the number of flights and airports hiring more staff to handle the expected surge in demand. However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.2022 was terrible for the equities market, as inflation reached new highs and took interest rates with it. The Fed showed no signs of slowing down until the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 got off to a decent start as the Fed issued a less aggressive rate hike and raised interest rates by 25 basis points at the February meeting. However, inflation is still running at roughly 3 times the target rate of 2%. Economists and analysts are divided on what the Fed will do at the next FOMC meeting in March and what is ahead for the economy.Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director: ""The Downturn Is Closer Than We Thought A Week Ago""On March 14 senior managing director at Evercore ISI, Julian Emanuel, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the market situation in the aftermath of the SVB crisis. Julian Emanuel said that year-end expectations for interest rates are on a wide spread, between 375 basis points and 525 basis points, and so one cannot predict interest rates with absolute certainty in the current environment. Julian Emanuel said that the Fed funds rate is dependent on economic data, and more importantly, it is dependent on the reaction of the markets to that data. In the case that we end 2023 with a Fed funds rate of 375 basis points, it could be both good or bad for the stock market, said Julian Emanuel. He said that if Fed tightening caused the collapse of SVB, the U.S. might end up in a mild recession. However, in the event of a mild recession, Julian Emanuel thinks that the market will hit a necessary bottom that will create an entry point for investors ""that will launch the next bull market phase"". Julian Emanuel reiterated how uncertain and volatile the current market situation is. He also said that before the SVB fallout, his clients were talking about how ""the no landing scenario was operative"", but now that does not seem like the case. Here are some comments from Julian Emanuel about what he expects for the markets ahead:Story continues""Part of the endgame is, we do wanna see a enough of a downturn to make stocks attractive, to cause this cathartic moment, where we can reset and multiples can begin expanding as the economic cycle turns. But we're still a ways from that. However, I would suggest whereas people were thinking this could last into '24, it does feel like the downturn is closer than we thought a week ago.""In the current market environment, many stocks have made new lows. However, it can be argued that some of these companies may be presenting attractive buying opportunities for investors. There are companies that have institutional participation and positive analyst sentiment that have crashed to their 52-week lows. However, it is possible that hedge funds either underestimated the risks associated with these companies or are optimistic about their future performance despite the current decline. Analysts who are positive about the companies may be focusing on their potential for long-term growth, rather than short-term challenges. Ultimately, it's unclear whether these companies are truly the best investment opportunities and so it is important for investors to conduct their own research and due diligence to make informed decisions. Some of the best 52-week low stocks to buy now according to analysts and hedge funds include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Pfizer Inc.

It provides attentive service and takes almost no credit risk on loans. A typical First Republic loan might be for 50% of the purchase price of a luxury home in Silicon Valley to an executive whose net worth is multiples of the value of the home. The bank has more than doubled revenue and net income over the past five years. In 2022, it grew household relationships by 15%, a remarkable number for a bank. But First Republic also got pinched in 2022 by the phenomenon of interest rates rising faster for short-term loans than for long-term loans. This happens because the market expects a recession: it costs more to borrow money for a year than for 10 years. For First Republic, this means it is paying high rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to customers, but then lending that money to long-term borrowers for only a bit more yield. Banks depend on a healthy spread between their cost of deposits and what they earn on loans. Lately, First Republic’s net interest margin has been disappointing. Still, earnings per share grew about 7% in 2022.The inversion of the yield curve may continue to pinch earnings growth in 2023, but longer-term First Republic continues to attract affluent customers and, as such, to grow low-risk loan volumes. When you don’t have credit losses and you do have steadily growing loan volumes, income should rise over time.With cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale of ICE in the fourth quarter, we invested more money in existing holdings First Republic Bank, M&amp;T Bank, Carmax, Floor &amp; Décor and SS&amp;C. We ended the year with about 2.5% cash.”13. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Baxter International Inc.

Has this asset stalled or is it a mid-teens grower? Other factors will determine the one true answer to this question, though FX and the stated headline make the answer seem obvious when it is not. When foreign exchange movements are modest, people tend to focus more on FX neutral assuming those changes will normalize over time, yet when movements are extreme the headline takes prominence.”Some of the most popular stocks that have hit new lows and are still held by hedge funds include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Pfizer Inc.

The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

The company remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning approximately $1 billion to investors in dividends in FY22.Andvari Associated mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with SOFI. Click here to check it out. JNJ 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of JNJPeter Lynch Chart of JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson plans to spin off its consumer health segment into a new standalone company called Kenvue by November 2023. The new company will own popular brands, including Tylenol and Listerine, and generated over $15 billion in revenue in 2022, about 16% of Johnson &amp; Johnson's sales. The separation aims to increase attention and valuation multiples for Kenvue, leading to significant growth and better shareholder returns. In addition, the move will allow Johnson &amp; Johnson to focus on specific priorities, driving growth in both companies and returning more capital to investors. However, unresolved liabilities from lawsuits related to allegedly cancer-causing talc in baby powder may hang over the stock.Johnson &amp; Johnson: Creating Shareholder ValueSource: 2022 Earnings PresentationInterestingly, the separation reflects how big corporations have been pressured to simplify their structures to increase focus, especially in health care. Rival GSK PLC (NYSE:GSK) has also recently completed the spinoff of its consumer health business. The spinoff presents a reasonably safe investment opportunity, and the risks the businesses face after the separation are similar to those already faced by investors of the legacy stock.Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceutical and medical equipment units, which produce cancer treatments and surgical tools, recorded nearly $80 billion in sales in 2022, way more significant than its consumer products revenue. As a result, Johnson &amp; Johnson will continue to own at least 80.1% of the voting power of Kenvue's shares upon completion of the offering.Story continuesOverall, the separation will lead to potentially safer investments. Investors, however, may want to consider if they want to start a new position in Johnson &amp; Johnson's stock before the separation. The combined dividends of both businesses at the time of the separation's completion are expected to be equal to those of Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Still, payouts may increase at different rates after that, and dividend yields may differ considerably.State of key driversJohnson &amp; Johnson faces many opportunities and challenges across its different business segments. The company may see continued growth in its over-the-counter business in the Consumer Health segment due to demand for cough, cold and flu products. However, supply constraints may hinder growth in the skin health (beauty) and oral care businesses. In addition, the baby care business may face competition and market weakness in crucial areas like India.In the pharmaceutical segment, Johnson &amp; Johnson's Immunology business is likely to grow with the continued adoption of Stelara and Tremfya, but competition from biosimilars could impact Remicade. In addition, the Covid-19 vaccine is expected to drive growth in the Infectious Diseases business, but increased competition could affect sales of other product lines.Market recovery and commercial initiatives could lead to growth in the MedTech segment, but competitive pressure and volume-based procurement may impact sales. The surgery business may see growth in advanced and general, but could face competition in the U.S. for endocutters and strong market demand for infection prevention products in biosurgery.While the company may see growth in some areas, such as its over-the-counter and immunology business, competition, supply constraints and market weaknesses could hinder growth in other areas, including skin health, oral care and oncology.Abiomed: A favorable fundamentalJohnson &amp; Johnson's recent acquisition of Abiomed, a leading provider of circulatory and oxygenation support medical technology, is expected to accelerate revenue growth and be accretive to the company's adjusted earnings per share in 2024. With the acquisition, Johnson &amp; Johnson's portfolio now includes 12 $1 billion-plus platforms, including Abiomed's range of innovative products.The company says the acquisition aligns with its strategic priorities as it extends Johnson &amp; Johnson's presence in the high-growth heart recovery market, with a total addressable market of over $35 billion in the U.S. Abiomed's pipeline of clinical and indication studies, combined with Johnson &amp; Johnson's established presence in the market, positions the company to capture a substantial market share.Johnson &amp; Johnson: Creating Shareholder ValueSource: Company presentationOverall, Fierce Biotech noted the acquisition will positively impact Johnson &amp; Johnson's financial performance and market valuation in the long term. With an extended portfolio of innovative medical technologies, the company will capture a larger share of the heart recovery market, resulting in increased revenue growth and earnings per share. The acquisition also provides Johnson &amp; Johnson with a platform for continued innovation, leading to sustained growth in the future.Promising pharmaceutical pipelineJohnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceutical pipeline includes potential approvals and clinical data updates. The company has several drugs awaiting approval. Several planned submissions for potential approvals include niraparib for L1 prostate cancer, talquetamab for multiple myeloma and BALVERSA for urothelial cancer patients. In addition, the company has numerous Phase III trials underway, covering various symptoms and patient populations.One of the drugs awaiting approval, niraparib, has already been approved in the EU for L1 prostate cancer patients. Talquetamab is another potential approval for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. and Europe. ERLEADA seeks approval for tablet reduction, while aprocitentan is considered for difficult-to-treat hypertension patients.According to Fierce Pharma, Johnson &amp; JoJohnson's pharmaceutical pipeline is diverse and packed with potential approvals and clinical data updates across various indications and patient populations, including tumor-agnostic patients, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.A failed scheme to avoid cancer lawsuitsJohnson &amp; Johnson has lost its attempt to use bankruptcy to escape more than 40,000 lawsuits linked to its talc-based baby powder products. The company had tried to offload liabilities to a spinoff called LTL Management and immediately put it into bankruptcy, but the court rejected the move. The so-called Texas two-step legal tactic aims to avoid facing lawsuits in other venues, but the court's decision makes it harder for corporations to use this tactic in future cases.Fundamentally, it led to Johnson &amp; Johnson facing stronger allegations that its baby powder was tainted with asbestos, hurting its position in ongoing lawsuits. The court's ruling means the company will have to defend itself against these claims, which increases its exposure to potential legal liabilities and may affect its financial performance and reputation in the long run. In addition, the ruling is expected to increase scrutiny from regulators and consumers, as well as make investors more cautious about investing in the company.However, the impact on Johnson &amp; Johnson's long-term financial performance and market valuations is uncertain. It depends on various factors, such as potential settlements and the company's ability to continue generating profits from its other products.Conclusion In conclusion, Johnson &amp; Johnson is a diversified health care company with a strong pipeline of potential drug approvals and, with the recent acquisition of Abiomed, revenue growth in the long term.The planned spinoff of its consumer health segment aims to increase focus and return more capital to investors. Overall, Johnson &amp; Johnson's strategic moves position the company for sustained growth and long-term value creation. However, unresolved liabilities may pose risks for the stock.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Brad Smith, you're looking at a live view of him right now. He's in the middle of all that action. And Brad, you've had a jam packed couple of days. Today, though, I know you took a look inside some of the technology that is being used right now in the medical space and spoke to some of those key players. What did you learn?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it is jam packed, indeed. And we've been jamming on the one all day long here. We're outside right now of the historic Willie Nelson Boulevard right now, where you've got, of course, the man, the myth, the legend in monumental form behind me. And this festival is going to turn more musical over these next few days, but prior to that, it's been all business all the time, especially for one company in Johnson &amp; Johnson, who's been presenting here at South by Southwest. You've got everyone from unicorn tech startups here all the way to the $400+ billion market cap companies that are showcasing their latest technology.And we had a chance to catch up with Shan Jegatheeswaran, who is actually the global head of medtech at J&amp;J. And he walked us through some of the innovations, especially on the virtual reality front, that are going to be so key in improving the patient experience, from the way that doctors are trained all the way to how patients are educated on the type of surgery that may be the future of this medtech technology. And they certainly look to move forward with that at J&amp;J. And here is a little bit of what he had to say during our conversation.SHAN JEGATHEESWARAN: I think in the short-term, it accelerates and increases access and equity, which is one of-- two of the largest issues to solve for in health care. In the longer term, it's going to lead to things like automation, lead to things like robotics and automation together, and that's a game changer in the future. There's always that storyline on AI and digital replacing things. I think the storyline here is around augmentation. It improves efficiency, improves precision. Think about-- the simplest example I can think about is what a calculator has done for folks in stats, mathematicians, data scientists. It hasn't replaced anyone. It's made them better, enabled them with tools, and ultimately better outcomes for them.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so if there is anything that I would draw through line on, it's that augmentation word here, particularly, and all of the conversations that we've been having from the likes of J&amp;J and even to grand chess master Garry Kasparov, also even into Shutterstock and their chief product officer. Everyone is saying that artificial intelligence should actually be reframed as augmented intelligence here.And in J&amp;J's case, this could improve the patient experience all the way into some of the other applications that we've continued to discuss in Shutterstock's case, that augmented intelligence is really what's going to create more of the skills that are necessary for the workforce to be able to work with some of the different language learning models that will help improve productivity.And so that's been the broader artificial intelligence conversation, but artificial intelligence is going to be so ingrained in robotics, in virtual reality, and all of those things driving some of the solutions that are being presented here at South by Southwest and could become a very real part of our lives within the next two to three years, some of them even quicker than that.And so all of that in mind, that's been kind of the common denominator in reframing the conversation around augmented-- around artificial intelligence into augmented intelligence, so that even as we're training some of these models, we're ensuring that they're learning along with us about how to be more ethical about the technology in artificial intelligence as a whole.SEANA SMITH: And that'd be huge going forward. And it's just amazing just how many industries it seems like every single one that AI will touch is already touching and will potentially touch in the years to come. Brad Smith, great work down there. Looks like a beautiful day, too. It's snowing here in New York City. I know.BRAD SMITH: What?SEANA SMITH: You need to share the--BRAD SMITH: I am sorry. I'm sorry.SEANA SMITH: --sunshine with us.BRAD SMITH: I mean, it's been cold in the mornings, if that means anything.SEANA SMITH: All right, that makes us feel a little bit better about the snow that we're looking at outside the window. All right, Brad Smith, thanks so much.]"

Together, the full system creates a new paradigm in electrophysiology through the unique integration of the Sphere-9 pulsed field ablation (PFA), radiofrequency (RF), and high density (HD) mapping catheter, which maps and ablates atrial arrhythmias (fast, abnormal heart rhythms) and provides real-time feedback through its intuitive mapping and navigation software. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common atrial arrhythmia, and nearly 60 million people are affected worldwide1 and five million patients will be added every year by 20302. Atrial arrhythmias, such as AFib, are associated with serious complications including heart failure, stroke and increased risk of death3-6.All-in-One Medtronic Sphere-9 CatheterThe Sphere-9 Catheter, coupled with the integrated mapping and navigation system, quickly generates sophisticated electro-anatomical maps allowing the physician to deliver wide-area focal ablation lesions of choice between RF or PFA, based on the patient and procedure needs. Given its size, the all-in-one catheter's nitinol 9mm ablation tip has the potential to require fewer focal ablation lesion applications that may result in lower procedure times than standard irrigated ablation catheters7. The intuitive mapping software enables an optimized user experience by delivering streamlined insights and feedback to support procedure performance.""The revolutionary Affera Mapping and Ablation System combined with the novel Sphere-9 Catheter represent a great advancement in the field of HD mapping and focal ablation,"" said Khaldoun Tarakji, M.D., MPH, vice president, chief medical officer, Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""Current technologies require the use of separate HD mapping and ablation catheters. The ability to map, ablate, and validate with the Sphere-9 Catheter enables the physician to eliminate the need to exchange catheters and empowers them to choose the energy source, whether RF or PF, based on the patient's needs. All this leads to improving efficiency and most importantly, enhancing the safety of ablation procedures for our patients.""Story continuesSupported by results from clinical studies assessing the safety and performance of the Sphere-9 Catheter and Mapping System, CE Mark approval comes on the heels of a December 2022 announcement that enrollment was completed in the Affera SPHERE Per-AF Clinical Trial, a randomized, controlled U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) pivotal trial. Designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Affera Mapping and Ablation System for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation, the SPHERE PER-AF IDE trial is currently in its 12 month follow up phase.""Electrophysiology is evolving at a rapid pace, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to be category creators once again with the all-in-one Sphere-9 Catheter, just as we did when Medtronic pioneered cryoablation technology,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president, Cardiac Ablation Solutions. ""Along with the PulseSelect™ PFA System, we are proud to be among the first to bring novel single shot and focal PF technologies to patients around the world.""The Affera Mapping and Ablation System will be commercially available beginning in the first half of 2023 in Europe and is investigational in the United States. Medtronic acquired Affera in August 2022. Worldwide, the PulseSelect System is investigational and not approved for sale or distribution.The Affera Mapping and Ablation system is limited to investigational use in the United States, Japan, and Canada.

(MRK) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-merck-co-130001489.html,1678798801,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has lost 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.88 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.60 indicates a change of +25% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.2%. The $58.51 billion and $62.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +6.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: ROK), the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation, announced the results of the 8th annual ""State of Smart Manufacturing Report."" The global study surveyed more than 1,350 manufacturers across 13 of the leading manufacturing countries including Australia, China, India, Japan and the Republic of Korea.(PRNewsfoto/Rockwell Automation)This year's report reveals a focus on delivering profitable growth without sacrificing quality, an emphasis on accessing data's true potential, and increasing adoption of technology to build resilience, enable agility, increase sustainability, and address workforce challenges.Key findings include:""Balancing quality and growth,"" and ""tracking or quantifying sustainable practices"" are the biggest internal obstacles inhibiting progress for Asia-Pacific (APAC) manufacturers this year, compared to deploying and integrating new technology in 2022.Globally, twice as many manufacturers believe their organization lacks the technology needed to outpace the competition, as compared to 2022.Four out of five manufacturers still lack an end-to-end supply chain planning solution.Close to half (44%) of APAC manufacturers plan to adopt smart manufacturing within the next year; out of this, China (80%), Australia (60%) and India (59%) are already using some components of smart manufacturing.The biggest barriers to adopting smart manufacturing for APAC manufacturers are employee resistance to technology adoption and change, lack of skill set to manage smart manufacturing implementation, and lack of clear definition of the value/ROI of smart manufacturing.Quality management system (QMS) is the smart manufacturing system that APAC respondents have seen the largest ROI, followed by manufacturing execution system (MES) and enterprise resource planning (ERP).Cybersecurity risks rank highest as the obstacle all respondents are looking to mitigate with smart manufacturing initiatives.88% of APAC manufacturers plan to maintain or grow employment due to technology adoption. Additionally, 39% of respondents believe they will be able to repurpose existing workers due to their increasing use of technology.Of the 94% of APAC manufacturers who have formal or informal environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies in place, close to half (48%) cite ""a competitive differentiator"" as the top driving factor for pursuing ESG initiatives.Story continues""Manufacturers are continuing to seek opportunities for profitable growth but are realizing that uncertainty in workforce availability is impacting quality, along with their ability to meet evolving customer needs,"" said Veena Lakkundi, senior vice president, Strategy and Corporate Development, Rockwell Automation. ""The survey found that smart manufacturing technology is enabling manufacturers of all sizes to optimize more resilient, agile, and sustainable solutions that accelerate transformation. If we've learned anything from history, it's that organizations that invest in innovation, with a bias for action, during times of uncertainty can outpace competitors.""Based on the survey findings, technology is crucial to mitigating risk and delivering growth. However, for one-third of manufacturers globally, the range of available systems and platforms is leading to ""technology paralysis"" – an inability to decide between solutions. Manufacturers can overcome this indecision by choosing a partner with relevant industry expertise and experience who can advise and guide them in implementing a fit-for-purpose solution to achieve desired outcomes.""At Rockwell, we combine the power of our portfolio of industry solutions with our second-to-none partner ecosystem to serve as a trusted advisor to leading companies around the world,"" said Lakkundi. ""As the biggest company focused solely on industrial automation and digital transformation, we work to make the complex simple and meet companies where they are in their journeys.""The full findings of the report can be found here.MethodologyThis report analyzed feedback from 1,353 respondents from 13 of the top manufacturing countries with roles from management up to the C-suite and was conducted in association with Sapio Research and Plex, by Rockwell Automation. Out of the total number of respondents, 425 are based in Asia-Pacific in Australia, China, India, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

That compares with 79 in the same period of 2022.Boeing said on Tuesday it delivered 28 aircraft in February, down from 38 in January amid a pause in 787 deliveries.It is not unusual for Airbus to start the year more slowly than Boeing after running flat-out in December, but this year's cumulative tally lags behind the average for the European firm.In the 10 years to 2018 - ignoring distortions from the Boeing MAX crisis in 2019 and COVID-19 disruptions since 2020 - Boeing secured an average of 13% of its annual deliveries in the first two months, while Airbus averaged 12%, Reuters calculates.To catch up with last year's first-quarter total of 140 net deliveries alone, Airbus would have to stage the second-sharpest increase from the end-February total seen in the past 20 years.Airbus is not alone in facing industrial problems. Lessors have said both jetmakers are delivering planes three-to-six months late, though Airbus is pushing to maintain higher industrial output.Story continuesBOARD OVERVIEWFaury told reporters last month that although he had been ""disappointed"" with January's slow start, Airbus was on track to meet its annual delivery target.""We have worked so much with suppliers in 2022 to overcome problems that we have a very deep and granular understanding of their...ability to ramp up and their own capacities. What we don't know is how the world will surprise us in 2023,"" he said.Airbus has for the most part blamed industrial delays on disruption at suppliers, though sources say its own internal operational performance and controls are also under scrutiny.The challenges appear to have captured the attention of the Airbus board, which said in a report issued ahead of the company's upcoming shareholder meeting that it planned to hold in-depth sessions on supply-chain management and other issues.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last Monday global supply chains had returned to normal, with pressures dropping to the lowest level since before the pandemic.But analysts say scarce labour and the impact of the Ukraine war on energy prices in Europe continue to hamper aerospace.Engine makers in particular are expanding to add dual or even treble sources for certain parts, Kevin Michaels, managing director of Aerodynamic Advisory, told Reuters.On Thursday, the head of France's Dassault Aviation highlighted the unpredictability in supply lines.""We are managing but it is real gymnastics every day,"" Eric Trappier told reporters. ""When a supplier says it isn't doing well and can't deliver, reaction time is close to zero.""(Reporting by Tim Hepher, Valerie Insinna; Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced that its first product based on its novel Illumina Complete Long Read technology is now available to order. The high-performance, long-read, human whole-genome sequencing (WGS) assay – Illumina Complete Long Read Prep, Human – is compatible with Illumina NovaSeq X Plus, NovaSeq X, and NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systems. For the first time ever, it offers users access to both long- and short-read data on the same Illumina instrument. Illumina Complete Long Reads enables a simpler workflow with drastically reduced DNA input requirements, compared to other long-read offerings.""Illumina Complete Long Reads is more convenient than other long-read technologies. We can prepare long-read libraries with low DNA input and without many of the required materials and equipment needed for other technologies,"" said HyungIl Lee, head of NGS Department at Macrogen.Seeing more of the most challenging genic regionsA small fraction of genic regions benefit from longer read lengths to enable improved resolution and mapping. By enabling access into these hard-to-map areas, Illumina's long-read data provides an additional tool in the advancement of genetic disease testing. This allows the scientific community to advance research by assaying the full breadth of genomic variation at scale to better facilitate discovery in areas of genetic disease research and pharmacogenomics.Illumina Complete Long Read Prep combines Illumina sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry with DRAGEN secondary analysis to deliver WGS with outstanding accuracy. The price of the Illumina Complete Long Read Prep, Human sequencing assay is inclusive of short- and long-read library prep, sequencing, and cloud analysis. The promotional price for customers is $1,350 USD per whole genome when using NovaSeq X Plus and a 25B flow cell, which will be commercially available later this year.Story continues""Many long-read solutions have been stunted by high DNA input requirements, complex workflows with low throughput, and highly variable results on dedicated long-read instruments,"" said Alex Aravanis, chief technology officer and head of research and product development at Illumina. ""Illumina Complete Long Reads overcomes those pain points and associated costs to make long-read sequencing accessible and streamlined for genomic labs.""Early customer data reinforces accuracy and flexibility At the Illumina Genomics Forum in September 2022, Aravanis presented preliminary Illumina Complete Long Read performance data against the benchmarking data sets from the PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge v2. Illumina Complete Long Reads with DRAGEN analysis generated an F1 score—a compound statistic of precision and recall—of 99.87%.Last month at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) conference, early-access customers shared data reinforcing Illumina Complete Long Reads' high accuracy and flexible DNA input, as well as the capabilities that help to reduce cost and operational complexity.Michael Quail, PhD, principal scientific manager, Sequencing R&amp;D at Wellcome Sanger Institute, said, ""The library prep was straightforward, with flexible input requirements. We are impressed with the accuracy of the data, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers.""Illumina plans to use this technology as a platform for long-read application development. In the second half of 2023, Illumina will launch an enrichment assay, an even more affordable, higher throughput, targeted solution focused on regions known to benefit from additional insight with longer reads. Illumina will explore additional applications beyond WGS and nonhuman samples in the future.To learn more, visit illumina.com/products/by-brand/complete-long-reads-portfolio.html.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business. The company also expects the aerospace division to experience revenue growth at a mid-to-high single digit rate and generate free cash flow equivalent to its net income in the same period. According to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), the combined power-equipment and renewable energy units are expected to experience mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit margins, despite the current challenges faced by the wind turbine business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has also reconfirmed its financial targets for 2023, which include more than doubling its adjusted earnings and generating up to $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesAir travel was expected to make a major comeback in 2023, with China reopening, airlines increasing the number of flights and airports hiring more staff to handle the expected surge in demand. However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

(NASDAQ:HON) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included industrials, Honeywell also lagged in the quarter after previously generating strong returns over extended periods.”8. L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“We also exited our position in L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris’ recent quarterly results showed some pandemic-related impact on the company’s business, though relative to other industrials stocks, the effect has been quite modest, and it is achieving ahead-of-schedule synergies from its recent merger. However, concerns about ballooning federal deficits and potential associated defense-budget cuts have been a headwind.

190,53496a1c-71a2-31e1-848e-da66d2d78cb8,NKE,2023-03-15,Nike (NKE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nke-expected-beat-earnings-140002635.html,1678802402,STORY,['NKE'],"[The market expects Nike (NKE) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.4%.Revenues are expected to be $11.37 billion, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.66% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike?For Nike, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +11.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Nike will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nike would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of +30.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nike appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nike is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NKE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 57 cents per share for NKE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NKE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +11.11% heading into earnings season.NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NKE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

These traits have been the key burdens on the participating companies' profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten the industry players due to their worldwide presence.However, the industry players are well-poised to benefit from the favorable health and wellness trends, which have been boosting the demand for activewear and athletic shoes. The new and innovative designs, along with increased consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, will likely continue to aid sales of fitness clothes and footwear. The industry players, focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth, are expected to gain.The industry participants have been investing in product innovation to gain market share. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like NIKE Inc., Deckers Outdoor, Skechers and Wolverine World Wide.About the IndustryThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories. The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.Story continuesA Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's FutureCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation, increased freight costs, reinvestments and other impacts. Supply-chain constraints, and elevated ocean freight and logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. A number of companies expect increased freight and logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&amp;A costs.Also, the industry participants are witnessing higher costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market remains another concern. These factors pose a threat to the industry players' margins.Consumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear and the trend is expected to continue in 2023. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing fashion sense is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States.The industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health &amp; wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market.Moreover, multi-functional shoes that cater to casual and formal looks have been gaining popularity. The increased participation of women in sports and outdoor activities in recent years has been a boon for industry players.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market's growth. The companies in the segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run.Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to the industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. The efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions both in stores and online.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #194, which places it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

We've got four names for you up on the board, Lennar, Freshpet, Guess, and First Republic Bank.Kicking it off with Lennar. Looking at gains of just about 3% in extended trading. This move has to do with the guidance that we just got out here from the homebuilder. They boosted their delivery guidance for the second quarter and also for the full year. The Street obviously very excited about that.EPS, their profit also coming in better than expected. So we're looking at gains of just about 3%.Moving on to Freshpet. A bit of a different story here with the stock off nearly 10% in extended trading. Some the headlines here crossing that the company is now looking to raise some financing, announcing $350 million in convertible notes-- senior note offerings here for the company as it does look to tap some financing. So we're looking at losses of nearly 10%.When you take a look at the longer-term chart of Freshpet, if we can flip over to that, year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 5%. Over the last year, though, the stock off just about 34%.Let's take a look at Guess. That stock off just about 8% in extended trading. The retailer disappointing the Street. Adjusted EPS, it did beat, but this was all about the guidance. The guidance missing expectations. They do see 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.46 to $2.80. Well, the Street was looking for $3.55, so coming up very short there.Over the past year, we're looking at gains of just about 22%. Year to date since January 1, just barely in the green.Now let's take a look at First Republic Bank. This stock, of course, has been on our radar now for a number of days in extended trading. We're looking at a pop of just about 12%, adding to the gains that we saw intraday. Although the gains that we are seeing that we did see today coming after a massive drop here in the stock. Intraday closing up just about 26%.Story continuesBut if you look at a five-day chart, the shares are still down about 65%. First Republic Bank one of the regional banks that have been caught up in the aftermath, some of the selling that we have seen within this industry following the collapse of silver bank-- Silicon Valley Bank, excuse me, on Friday and then also Silvergate over the weekend.Charles Schwab, that stock up just about 3/10 of a percent, and Zions, that stock up just about 2%.

For more on the sector and the impact of the SVB crash, we're joined by Morningstar equity analyst Eric Compton. Eric, good to see you. How does Moody's slapping a downgrade watch on six US banks impact your expectations?ERIC COMPTON: Yeah, so I mean, we broadly agree with the sentiment expressed by Moody's where, in our own forecasts, we are going to be acknowledging some of these, for example, increased funding pressures. I think they're absolutely right about that. There's going to be increased competition for deposits. Banks are going to want to shore up the funding side of the balance sheet.And so, yeah, that's going to hit-- it's going to hit net interest income. It's going to hit bank profitability. You could see things like increased regulation in the future, which would also likely be a drag on profitability. So, broadly, I agree with the sentiment there that bank profitability is going to be pressured over the next several quarters for sure.DAVE BRIGGS: Just want to follow up on you actually think there's a path to increase regulation, as in getting legislation through a Republican-led House?ERIC COMPTON: I mean, legislation or increased regulation could happen through several avenues, and it could take more than the next six months or a year. So I just think over the longer term, regulators do not look good right now. And they're going to want to change things to ensure something like this doesn't happen. And some of those changes, you could see come from the Fed, come from the FDIC, increased regulatory capital requirements, changing how regulatory capital is defined, things like that. So, nothing for sure there. But when a blow-up like this tends to happen, you tend to see more stringent regulation in the future.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Eric, put this in perspective for us. When you look at the collapse of SVB, comparing SVB to some of the banks that are in your coverage list, and some of those names have been hit hard over the last couple of days-- Comerica, First Republic, Zions. They all initially took those hits. How did they stack up when you compare them to SVB?ERIC COMPTON: Yeah, it's a great question. And one that we're getting a lot is, how unique is SVB? And the answer to that is SVB was very unique when you look at, for example, the unrealized losses on their securities, but compared to total capital, equity was a 0 at that point. And then it was just a question of, are they going to have to realize those losses? No other bank under my coverage comes anywhere close to that amount of duration risk or unrealized loss risk.So SBV was unique in that regard. Some of the metrics you all highlighted before about just the positive flight risk, uninsured risk, SVB was also fairly unique in those regards. And all the banks under my coverage score better on those screens. And so, on the one hand, SVB was a unique situation. And maybe all the regional regionals under my coverage survive from here. I don't think there's a reason why any of them have to be the next one taken over.However, the big unknown is, does this create enough fear where you create enough deposit flight from one of these institutions where it potentially puts it into stress? So all the banks underwrite coverage very different from SVB. However, no bank is completely immune to a bank run if it is large enough, is the unfortunate reality.DAVE BRIGGS: Of course, the biggest banks-- the biggest difference in that regard, you still have some buy on some of those. Who, and why?ERIC COMPTON: Yeah, so we think that while acknowledging the high level of uncertainty right now, the market is pricing a lot of these banks as if they are going to be-- they're trying to discount who the survivors are and who aren't. And so these banks, especially a lot of these smaller regionals, if they survive, these distressed prices will likely go up.And so under my coverage, some of the names that have sold off quite a bit, looking at, like, a Comerica, for example, if they can keep that deposit base intact, today's prices just aren't going to make a whole lot of sense. Zions is another one that kind of comes up where they did not take much risk on the security side of the balance sheet. The losses compared to capital are not that high.The big question is-- and no one knows for sure how deposits are going to shake out, but if they can keep that deposit base intact, today's prices are going to look pretty good, I think, two, three years from now. So those are some of the names I would highlight. Truist is another one where they have the benefit of being one of the larger regionals. And so I think maybe more incrementally likely to maybe see some of those deposit inflows. And they've also sold off pretty hard.A little bit more unrealized losses for them. But in the end, I think they make it. And if they do, today's prices, I think, will be a bit higher two to three years from now once this initial shock kind of plays out.SEANA SMITH: And Eric, though, talking about the short-term here, the current environment, how much tougher does this make it to gauge or predict deposit flows, to predict funding costs? Does that make it exponentially more challenging for you as an analyst?ERIC COMPTON: 100%. The difficulty of the job, being a bank analyst, has gone up a lot over the last couple of days. And at the end of the day, it's-- I just have to admit, and I think anyone who's being honest has to admit, no one knows for sure what deposit bases are going to look like in next quarter's results. And that's the big uncertainty we're dealing with. And you can try to put guardrails around it, predict who's better or worse positioned. But at the end of the day, it is going to be very hard to predict what deposit bases look like in the near term.SEANA SMITH: All right, Eric Compton, Morningstar, thanks so much. Always great to have you here.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance.

Over the last seven days, $416 million of new short selling in the regional banks has emerged amid this drop, S3 Partners says.That said, with some calm returning back to markets mid-week and bank-bust narratives cooling, the short trade on regionals could be poised to go the other way.""We should see a wave of short covering in some of the regional banking stocks in response to this sudden spike in stock prices as short sellers look to realize some of their recent $2.29 billion of mark-to-market profits,"" says S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky.A customer leaves after speaking with FDIC representatives inside of the Silicon Valley Bank headquarters in Santa Clara, California, U.S., March 13, 2023.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world.There is no need to emphasize the value of the pharmaceutical industry after the Covid-19 pandemic. Without the immediate advancements that pharma companies came up with to developed the Covid-19 vaccine, it is very likely that the world would still be fighting the pandemic which in two years devastated the global economy. The development of vaccines by some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world at a pace that surprised every single person led the inoculation of hundreds of millions worldwide and brought an early end to the pandemic.Even though pharmaceutical indexes, including the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF, recorded a total return of -4.78% in 2022, this return has been better than the S&amp;P 500 index return of -19.44% in the same time period. Even though a negative return seems to indicate an industry floundering, the truth is that U.S. shares have suffered greatly as a result of rising inflation and interest rates, while the threat of an imminent recession did not help matters. Hence, comparing returns from pharmaceutical indexes to S&amp;P 500 returns provides a more accurate picture, one that shows pharma companies performed well above the average.25 biggest pharmacuetical companies in the worldadriaticfoto/Shutterstock.comThe 2023 outlook for the pharma industry seems quite interesting. According to PwC, areas of activity in 2023 will focus on high growth opportunities, which means that mergers and acquisitions will focus more on oncology and immunology, while other areas including vaccines, cardiovascular diseases and central nervous systems diseases will also be areas of focus. In 2022, the total value of merger and acquisition deals was $158.5 billion, a significant fall of around 40% vs 2021 with the biggest such deal being the $30 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics by Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). The greatest value in the pharma industry lies in developing solutions for unmet medical needs for which the market will place a premium. The aforementioned decrease in M&amp;A shows headwinds being faced by the medtech sector while uneven capital market performance hasn't helped the situation. Deals have always been a major part of the pharma industry and despite the area stagnating in 2022, the expectation is that deals will continue to increase in 2023 as inorganic growth is still expected to drive overall growth.Story continuesMeanwhile, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) lost out on its bid for Horizon Therapeutics but the pharma giant, which is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, is purchasing Provention Bio, a pharma company specializing in diabetes, for $2.5 billion, at $25 per share in cash, which brings us to another interesting point; cash is king in the pharma industry as the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world are taking advantage of biotech companies hemorrhaging cash, mainly because of an IPO slump in the previous year and an impending recession leaving little options to raise cash. As many biotech companies are facing cashflow issues, the competition for private funding is higher and public markets are basically closed off for them, getting offers from pharmaceutical companies seems to be the only option for these companies. Since cashflow is an issue, most biotech companies prefer purchases in cash as opposed to the traditional method of buying a company in exchange for shares or a combination of shares and cash.Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of Seagen, an oncology focused biotech company, for $43 billion, as the pharma giant has used its extra earnings and profits from its successful Covid-19 vaccine to ramp up purchases. Not only does this give Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) a huge advantage in a segment which is considered to be the future of pharma, it also allows the company to substitute this purchase for its R&amp;D expense. When a company acquires another company, the purchase price isn't taken to the profit and loss but the balance sheet, which means it doesn't impact the net profit of the company. This in turn means that even though this $43 billion purchase is technically an R&amp;D expense for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), by purchasing a company, the company's price earnings ratio looks lower and more attractive to investors, since its earnings aren't reduced. ""We aren't acquiring the golden eggs, we are buying the goose that lays the golden eggs,"" said Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO.One of the challenges that the pharmaceutical industry is facing is generics threatening the market share of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, as loss of patents, licenses and trademarks of major revenue generating drugs is allowing generic pharma companies to enter the space and provide drugs at a much lower cost, thus gaining more market share. In many countries, governments are encouraging local generic manufacturers with subsidies and grants as opposed to multinationals to allow residents to purchase cheaper drugs. In the next decade, pharma companies are expected to lose billions of dollars in revenue while there isn't enough in R&amp;D pipelines to offset this revenue loss completely, which is another reason why M&amp;A rule the pharma world.Another area that has seen further developments in recent years is the HIV segment. While HIV has existed for decades now, there are some exciting changes in the area, with a third person becoming free of HIV after receiving virus-resistant cells, though the risks linked to the procedures mean that widespread treatment is still unlikely for the foreseeable future. In addition, while traditionally HIV pills have been required to be ingested every single day or even multiple dosages a day, advancements in drugs have allowed the development of new PrEP medication which significantly reduces a person's dosage to just every other month, with three companies having PrEP drugs approved by the CDC for usage.According to Fitch, the outlook for the pharma sector is neutral as despite inflationary measures and higher interest rates, a supportive operating environment still remains. Meanwhile IQVIA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:IQV), which provides data on the health information and clinical research, stated that the Covid-19 pandemic's beneficial impact to the pharmaceutical industry is expected to add $500 billion to the industry from 2020 to 2027, with the biggest growths expected in Africa, Latin America and Asia, due to greater excess, higher demand and an increasing population. Meanwhile, low growth is expected in the U.S. and Europe, which for most of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are their biggest markets. Biotech is also the biggest thing in pharma right now, which is why it's worth getting a head-start in this space by considering the most undervalued biotech stocks.The biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world have a combined market cap exceeding $3.5 trillion, while their trailing twelve month (TTM revenue) exceeds $1 trillion.

Under the revised terms, Pfizer is asking for payment for doses ordered that will never be manufactured, the FT report said.""Working together we have achieved a significant reduction of doses, an extension of our contract in time far beyond 2023, and security of supply in case more doses are needed,"" European Union Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement.""If we want to modify vaccines deliveries, we need a deal,"" Kyriakides added.The new terms were presented to health ministers of member states in a private meeting, according to the report. They met resistance from four member states, including Poland.Assen Medzhidiev, acting minister for health of Bulgaria, said his country along with Poland, Hungary and Lithuania opposed the proposed deal on surplus vaccines.Medzhidiev added that he believed other EU members also would not support the proposed deal in its current form.""The proposed Pfizer amendment to the Pfizer agreement is clearly unacceptable to us given the critical situation of vaccine oversupply in Bulgaria and unjustified financial burden for products destined for destruction,"" Medzhidiev said.""We call on the Commission to return to the negotiating table, taking fully into account the mandate given.

The deal values Seagen shares at $229 and 15% above current levels.Pfizer stock ended yesterday’s trading session up 1% with hopes that acquiring Seagen will give the company a boost as revenue from its Covid-19 vaccine begins to fade.Let’s see if investors should consider Pfizer or Seagen stock following the acquisition announcement.Brief Overview The acquisition of Seagen would add to Pfizer’s product portfolio and sustainability in its drug pipeline. Specifically, Seagen would provide a boost to Pfizer’s Oncology segment through its antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) a form of cancer treatment that attacks cancer cells with toxins.Pfizer anticipates that its revenue from ADCs will be around $10 billion by 2030. Seagen’s revenue last year was $1.96 billion although the company isn’t profitable yet and had a total loss of $610 million in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; OutlookPiggybacking off the potential growth Pfizer would obtain through the acquisition, Seagen sales are projected to rise 19% this year and climb another 34% in FY24 to $3.14 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent 133% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $917 million.Seagen’s earnings are expected at -$2.99 per share in FY23 with EPS of -$1.02 forecasted in 2024 as the company moves closer to profitability. With that being said, earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last 60 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Pfizer, earnings are forecasted to drop -46% this year to $3.52 per share compared to EPS of $6.58 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rebound and rise 8% although earnings estimates have trended down significantly throughout the quarter.Sales are projected to decline -32% in FY23 and then rise 1% in FY24 to $69.24 billion. Fiscal 2024 would still be a 33% increase from pre-pandemic sales of $51.75 billion in 2019.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecent PerformanceOutside of shares of Seagen popping yesterday on the acquisition news, optimism surrounding the growth of the company’s ADC cancer treatment has continued to boost its stock in recent years. In contrast, Pfizer stock has continued to decline as we move further from the Covid-19 pandemic and the company sees less of a boost from its Comirnaty vaccine.Seagen stock is up a stellar +55% year to date to easily top the S&amp;P 500’s virtually flat performance and Pfizer’s -22%. Over the last three years, Seagen’s +107% has also topped the benchmark and Pfizer’s +32%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayPfizer stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with Seagen landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Long-term, acquiring Seagen may be beneficial for Pfizer but there could be more short-term weakness ahead with earnings estimate revisions largely declining throughout the quarter and the acquisition could further dilute the company’s bottom line.As for Seagen stock, its strong performance could continue with its acquisition price nicely above current levels of $199 per share despite earnings estimates declining as well. For now, investors may be rewarded for holding on to shares of SGEN as they could drift higher to the acquisition price of $229 per share.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$151 and falling to the lows of US$125. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether International Business Machines' current trading price of US$126 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at International Business Machines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines What's The Opportunity In International Business Machines?Great news for investors – International Business Machines is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $159.34, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, International Business Machines’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from International Business Machines?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. International Business Machines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about International Business Machines as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

219,faa03bb6-5c4b-3405-8e70-b1a3879ec574,MPC,2023-03-15,11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-crude-oil-stocks-022751975.html,1678847271,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'FANG', 'HAL', 'PXD', 'CVX', 'DVN', 'MPC', 'XOM', 'OXY']","[In this article, we discuss the 11 best crude oil stocks to buy as tensions rise. To skip the detailed analysis of the crude oil market, go directly to the 5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy.Crude oil is one of the most primed industries in the world. However, it is also quite volatile which has been quite evident in recent years. According to Maximize Market Research, the industry’s market size reached $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by 2029. The global oil reserves volume is at around 1.65 trillion barrels while 99.8 million barrels were consumed daily on average in 2022, up from 94.1 million barrels a day in 2021.Latest Updates on the Crude Oil MarketCrude oil prices went flying shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine to around $119 per barrel on March 6 due to sanctions on Russian fossil fuel imports by the USA and part of Europe. However, the prices have dropped down to the pre-war levels with crude oil trading at around $74 per barrel WTI.The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) February 2023 report predicts that the global oil supply could reach higher than the demand in the first half of 2023. However, we reported previously that for the full year 2023, the global oil demand is expected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to just shy of 102 million barrels per day. The biggest factor in this rise in demand is set to come from China as its travel restrictions ease and borders open up. Furthermore, the seasonal demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in Europe recently rose in winter. However, the US and OPEC warned that they are unable to increase the output which is expected to leave Europe in hot waters as Russia previously cut off some important pipeline flows of natural gas in retribution for imposing energy sanctions backed by the USA.Additionally, the recent collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank disturbed the equities market which also slightly affected the oil prices as they fell by around 2% on March 13. However, this seems temporary and is expected to be offset by the recovery in demand by China.Story continuesCrude Oil Market in the FutureIn one of our articles, we highlighted that the global oil demand will reach its peak between 2023 and 2025. Nevertheless, due to climate risks, the world is making a shift toward renewable energy sources which will offset the demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in the future. The demand for coal-based energy is slowly declining and it is only a matter of time before the fossil fuel demand drop starts affecting crude oil.Nevertheless, crude oil is a much more important source of energy than coal, so the prices are expected to keep rising till the global crude oil reserves are exhausted in around 47 years. Even though renewable energy sources are taking over, the need for petrochemicals and long-distance travel will still keep the global oil demand stable. The IEA believes that by 2040, the demand will increase to 104.1 million barrels of oil per day from approximately 98 million in 2019. Furthermore, crude oil prices are also expected to increase because as time passes, cheap oil sources are set to decline gradually.In the current market, crude oil stocks might be volatile but several of them have remained to be some of the most profitable companies in the world and have decent shareholder returns. Some of the crude oil stocks that investors need to look out for are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions RisePhoto by Zbynek Burival on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe analyzed the global crude oil market and chose the best stocks to buy, keeping their hedge fund sentiment as the most important metric and taking the analyst ratings around each stock into consideration. Most of the companies on the list have strong balance sheets and have maintained good profitability over the years.  Moreover, their capital returns have also remained healthy.We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds. Note that we skipped the companies whose crude oil production covered less than 10% of their business portfolio.11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise11. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the world’s largest oilfield services and equipment companies. It is an American company with headquarters in Texas, USA, and Dubai, UAE. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the best crude oil stocks and one of Jim Cramer’s top picks for 2023.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a significantly fairly valued company with a PE ratio of 19.9x at the time of writing, compared to its peer average of 21.2x. Moreover, it is also trading below the US Energy Services industry which has a PE ratio of 23x.On January 30, HSBC analyst Abhishek Kumar reiterated a Buy rating on Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) and raised his price target to $57 from $43.90. The analyst is quite confident in the company’s growth outlook for 2023. Kumar noted that both US and international growth expectations for the company look strong.In the fourth quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds held positions in Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), up from 48 in the third quarter. The biggest stake in the company was held by Pzena Investment Management, with 7.89 million shares worth $310.624 million. It was followed by Point72 Asset Management which increased its stake in the company by 144% in the fourth quarter to 3.3 million shares worth $129.947 million.Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) are some of the best crude oil stocks along with Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL).Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides energy, engineering and construction services and is a manufacturer of products for the energy industry. The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”10.

Here Are 2 Names to Consider,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-o-leary-says-avoid-195144060.html,1678823504,STORY,"['SBNY', 'TRGP', 'MPC']","[In the wake of multiple bank collapses over the past week, many banking stocks’ valuations have fallen sharply and are trading at deep discounts right now.One investor, however, that definitely won’t be looking for any bargains amongst the carnage is ‘Shark Tank’ star Kevin O’Leary. With the government having stepped in to ensure depositors walk away unscathed from the SVB and Signature Bank debacles, O’Leary anticipates a flurry of tighter regulation around banks, regional or not, and that will eat into any potential profits.“If you thought putting your money into bank stocks was a good idea,” says O’Leary, “you should change your mind this morning — forever.”So, where should investors be looking right now? Easy. According to O’Leary, energy is the place to be. Energy stocks have cash flow and distributions, and O’Leary only recently described the sector as looking “golden” and primed to push ahead from here.With this in mind, we dipped into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on two energy stocks investors should consider adding to the portfolio. The Street’s analyst certainly think these are worth a punt – both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)We’ll start off with the U.S.’s largest independent refiner, Marathon Petroleum. The company’s refining activities include refining crude oil and other feedstocks, while Marathon also boasts branded locations – including retail outlets – spread throughout the United States. Additionally, through its refining logistics assets, and a network of pipelines, terminals, towboats, and barges, the company moves, stores and distributes crude oil and refined products – primarily for the Refining &amp; Marketing sector. These midstream activities are run by its subsidiary MPLX, largely owned by MPC.It’s a business that is thriving in times like these, as was evident in the company’s latest quarterly report – for 4Q22. Revenue rose by 12.6% year-over-year to $40.09 billion, while beating the Street’s call by $4.8 billion. Adjusted net income came to $3.1 billion, or $6.65 per diluted share, far above the net income of $794 million, or $1.30 per diluted share delivered in the same period last year. The figure also easily beat the $5.53 forecast.Story continuesThroughout 2022, MPC returned $13.2 billion of capital to shareholders – $11.9 billion via share repurchases and the rest through dividends – the quarterly payout currently stands at $0.75, yielding 2.4%. Moreover, the company also announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization.What it all boils down to, according to Jefferies analyst Dushyant Ailani, is a company that will keep on delivering the goods for investors over the coming years.“Strong FCF generation, cash balance, and distributions from MPLX give us confidence in MPC’s ability to return capital to shareholders through the cycle,” Ailani explained. “Assuming ~75% of OCF is returned to shareholders (similar to ’22), we estimate MPC has the ability to buy back ~$23bn or 38% of its market cap through 2025.”Accordingly, Ailani rates MPC shares a Buy while his $157 price target suggests the stock will surge 23% in the year ahead. (To watch Ailani’s track record, click here)Barring one skeptic, all of Ailani’s colleagues agree; the additional 10 Buys overpower a lone Hold, providing this stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $147.92 average target, investors will be sitting on returns of 16% a year from now. (See MPC stock forecast)Targa Resources (TRGP)Next up is Targa Resources, one of the biggest independent midstream players in North America. The company delivers natural gas and natural gas liquids across the U.S. while its gathering and processing assets are strategically placed in some of the U.S most attractive basins – Targa has operations in the Permian Basin, Bakken Shale, Barnett Shale, Eagle Ford Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, onshore Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico.The company had some record numbers on display in its Q4 and full-year 2022 report. Despite a year-over-year drop in revenue, Targa saw its adjusted EBITDA climb substantially compared to the same period a year ago. The company delivered a record adjusted EBITDA of $840.4 million, amounting to a 47.28% uptick over the $570.6 million reported in 4Q21. And for the full year, adjusted EBITDA reached a record $2.90 billion, far above the $2.05 billion reported for the full year 2021. Q4 net income came in at $318.0 million, also a vast improvement on the $313.0 million net loss on display in the year-ago quarter.As a bonus for income minded investors, Targa also pays a dividend; the quarterly payout currently stands at $0.35, which generates a yield of 1.94%.For Scotiabank analyst Tristan Richardson, Targa’s value proposition lies in it being one of its segment leaders. He writes: “With a customer portfolio that has evolved dramatically over the past several years as a result of customer consolidation and a high grading of contract terms, we expect increased stability of earnings going forward – namely, lower commodity variability in 2023 and 2024 versus previous years. Targa remains in a commodity cycle business with even large stable producers reacting to price signals in the market; however, with its integrated model, large gathering and processing (G&amp;P) supply funnel, and position on the water, Targa remains one of the best positioned in midstream.”These comments underpin Richardson’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating and $115 price target. There’s potential upside of 59% from current levels. (To watch Richardson’s track record, click here)Boasting a full house of Buys only – 12, in total – this stock naturally claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target currently stands at $100.58, suggesting the shares will climb 39% higher over the one-year timeframe.

221,64bbf934-abf3-331a-9ae8-997a0625ba2c,MPC,2023-03-15,Silicon Valley Bank: What Happened and Where Can Investors Hide,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-happened-where-154703689.html,1678808823,STORY,"['BAC', 'MPC']","[As most everyone has heard by now, Silicon Valley Bank has been shuttered and depositors have been backed by the Federal Reserve and its new “Bank Term Funding Program.” But what exactly happened, and what stocks can investors buy to avoid the fallout?One way to avoid more carnage is to focus on quality defensive stocks.Silicon Valley BankAs the name suggests, Silicon Valley Bank was an institution that catered primarily to start-ups and venture capitalists, although not exclusively. With the explosion of tech and venture funding that followed the Covid-19 pandemic so too did the growth of Silicon Valley Bank. Between 2019 and 2022 deposits at the bank grew from $60 billion to $190 billion.In response to this massive influx of new deposits, SVIB began to load up on “safe” assets. It bought $80 billion of Mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasury bonds. While these are typically nearly risk-less assets, the bank unfortunately bought the top of the bond market. As interest rates climbed thoughout all of 2022, bond prices fell in response, creating paper losses on the banks portfolio. Additionally, SVIB did very little to try and hedge its interest rate risk.Compounding the issues, deposits started falling rapidly. With the cycle coming to an end, many of the venture backed businesses banking with SVB were losing money or outright failing, drawing down deposits from the bank.To protect against these drops in deposits, the bank began selling some of its bonds at a loss. To manage the losses, SVB attempted a stock offering to raise $2.25 billion. This is where it all went wrong. This unconventional means of filling a liquidity gap spoked investors and eventually depositors.In a single day, on March 9, $42 billion of deposits withdrew and induced a run on the bank. This came primarily in the form of venture investments, as many well-known investors pushed companies to withdraw as soon as possible. Panic ensued and before the end of the day, Friday, the bank had closed preventing further withdrawals.Story continuesThankfully, the Fed and Treasury had the whole weekend to figure out a solution. First there were whispers of an auction occurring for the banks’ assets, but on Sunday evening the emergency action from the Fed was announced. They would open the Bank Term Funding Program to save the failing institution.The BTFP is an emergency solution allowing banks to borrow funds against their current bond positions. Most importantly, it allows them to borrow against the par value of the bonds, allowing the institutions to avoid realizing any more losses on their bond portfolios.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank marks the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.What Now?This is a tremendous event the full effect of which is still unknown. The situation is still extremely fluid, and although it seems like the largest banks such as J.P. Morgan JPM, and Bank of America BAC are likely safe from contagion they are still selling off. Furthermore, the Regional Bank ETF KRE is down -11% just today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs tempting as it is for some investors to start scooping up shares of beaten down banks, I am not so confident. While the big banks, and even regional bank stocks may well recover from here it feels too risky to jump in now. I would much prefer to focus on buying defensive stocks in case this issue has legs.Safety StocksIn looking for stocks I think may perform well in a more challenging economic environment I focus on stocks with a high Zacks Rank, an established business, a low P/E, and a decent dividend yield.Marathon Petroleum MPC is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and a reasonable valuation.Trading at 7x one-year forward earnings, Marathon Petroleum is well below its five-year median of 11x and just slightly above the industry average of 6x. It also offers a dividend yield of 2.3%, which has increased by an average of 7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher Daniels Midland ADM, one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients is another stock that should provide a safe and steady return. ADM has a long history of continual dividend increases, and currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been revised higher across all timeframes by as much as 25% over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdditionally, ADM is trading at a very reasonable 11x one-year forward earnings, below its five-year median of 14x, and under the industry average 14x.ASE Technology ASX is a provider of semiconductor manufacturing services for assembly and testing. ASX may not be the most exciting growth stock out there, but it has steady returns, consistent revenue growth, and a dividend yield of 4.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchASX is trading at 9x one-year forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 13x and well below the industry average 19x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchASE Technology also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strongly upward trending earnings revisions.ConclusionThe failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a significant event with unknown and potentially very far-reaching effects. The rising rate environment has begun to show that points of weakness developed during the boom, and this may not be the last case. To remain risk-averse, identifying defensive stocks may be one safe way to trade through this challenging period. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

She's worked hard to prove herself and now she enjoys showing other women that they can accomplish their goals, even if it's doing something unexpected.From welding to competing in the Highland Games, Chippewa has always enjoyed a variety of non-traditional jobs and hobbies.""I like setting the example for my kids that it doesn't matter what kind of job it is. If you want it, you can go get it,"" said Chippewa.""I want other girls and women to see people like me working in the industrial field and know they can do it, too. It's all about empowering women and resetting what's normal.""The early yearsGrowing up, Chippewa spent a lot of time with her grandfather, an oil rigger in the 1990s. She had her own little hard hat and would visit rigs with him. Her uncle ran an autobody shop, and her father worked at the Detroit refinery. She grew up farming and fishing. She loved to watch welders work. She discovered that she enjoyed working with her hands and that she was good at it.""I used to call her a pocket-sized Hercules,"" said Ray Richardson, Chippewa's father and retired Operator and Training Specialist. ""She's always accepted a challenge. If you tell her she can't do something, she'll prove you wrong every time.""Story continuesRay Richardson retired from the Detroit refinery in 2020. He loved his career there and wanted to share the career opportunities he had with his children.""When my dad was working at the refinery, I participated in the Summer Helper program for employees' children who had just graduated high school and were enrolled in college,"" said Chippewa. ""It was 2012, a year the refinery was undergoing a major maintenance event. That's when I realized I wanted to work in the industrial field.""Life at the refineryChippewa went to school to learn welding. After a year working as a welder, she applied for a position with Marathon Petroleum, which her father agreed was a good decision on her part.""There's a level of safety at the refinery that I felt my kids could work there,"" said Richardson. ""Marathon's commitment to safety has always been very high. Marathon has been steadfast in keeping their refineries safe.""Chippewa is now a qualified board operator and a qualified field equipment operator, which requires extra time and training to accomplish.""We train for at least nine months or longer to be a field equipment operator,"" said Chippewa. ""Then after two years, you can become a board operator. That's another six months of training. Then you become qualified, and I'm qualified in both roles.""Chippewa said being qualified in both roles means that when the refinery is fully staffed, she can help with projects and has stepped up as foreman a few times. She also fills in for other employees when they are on vacation or out sick.""I like that my routine is that there is no routine,"" said Chippewa. ""I do different stuff every day.""She loves her job so much, she convinced her brother Jamieson Richardson to apply for a job at the refinery, because it offered better pay, better insurance and a better work schedule than what he had. Richardson was glad he listened. As a field equipment operator at a different complex at the refinery, he enjoys the opportunities to learn about the refining process and how the equipment works. When he started, he was told he had big shoes to fill in order to be as good as Chippewa.""Now we have what I call Operators Dinners with my dad and my brother,"" said Chippewa. ""We get together and talk about work stuff. It's great to be able to share and ask questions. We've bonded in that way.""Chippewa has also taken a lead at the refinery, speaking on a women's employee network panel at the refinery hosted during Women's History Month, and working with the safety team on finding personal protective equipment sized for women.Extra-curricular activitiesOutside of work, Chippewa's interest in doing the unexpected continues. She's started competing in the Scottish Highland Games throwing a large, tapered pole called a caber.""It is typically a male-dominated sport, but I've seen more women participating,"" said Chippewa. ""I work in a job that most women don't work. Now I'm a class C (amateur) in the Highland Games and ranked 40th in North America in women's caber toss. My goal is to make the top 5 in the Lightweight class next year.""As a mother of two, Chippewa strives to set a positive example for her son and daughter and teach them that they can do whatever they set their mind to doing. She also encourages other females to understand what they really like to do and follow that passion.""She's just a fantastic human being,"" said Jamieson Richardson.

223,364baf3d-9b07-3a92-8378-dddcd09f714a,MPC,2023-03-15,Wall Street Analysts See Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-marathon-133001538.html,1678800601,STORY,['MPC'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marathon Petroleum (MPC) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Marathon Petroleum, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MPC a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 12.5% over the past month to $19.63.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.

United shares slumping on a pessimistic outlook for the current quarter. You can see shares off 6.5%. UAL expects an adjusted loss per share between $0.60 and $1.00 due to expenses related to this new collective bargaining agreement with employees that are represented by the Pilots Association.In a filing, United says they continue to see, quote, ""a strong demand environment,"" and now expects first quarter 23 operating revenue up approximately 50% versus Q1 of '22. But they added that January and February were lower demand months. Increased fuel prices also weighed on costs there.Elsewhere in the sector, Southwest, Alaska, Spirit Airlines gave weak to lackluster guidance, while JetBlue said it continues to experience, quote, ""robust travel demand trends. They were up solidly earlier in the day, have cut back down to Earth. So a bit of a mixed look on an industry that has been on fire in recent months.SEANA SMITH: It has been on fire. And we had discussed many times that airlines continue to raise their fares. And it looked like consumers were willing to pay anything that was put forward in front of them. And when we got this latest revision here from United, from some of its peers out there in the industry, it looks like we may be seeing consumers pulling back just a little bit or getting a little bit more cost conscious on what they are paying for fares, because it doesn't look like United, at least, is going to be able to be charging those same amounts here going forward.- That was what stuck out to me, right, is it's the jet fuel. At some point, rising jet fuel prices, you can only cut costs so much. And really that does get passed on to the consumer. They initially thought it was going to be $3.19-- look at that, updating the guidance to $3.31 to $3.41 per gallon of jet fuel.Story continuesThat's a pretty big bump there from what they were anticipating. So unfortunately, I don't know if that's going to mean cheaper tickets for us any time soon, guys. I was hoping for it, but probably not.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. If demand continues to fall, or pull back, or not meet their expectations, we might be looking at lower prices sooner than we thought.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll tell you what, they got a mess on their hands with this storm hitting the East Coast. I have a flight delayed two hours.SEANA SMITH: Oh no.DAVE BRIGGS: I think the whole coast is starting to see the impact of that one.

For more bank stocks, head on over to 5 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds. These days, anything that anyone can talk about in the finance industry is the collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB). SVB's fate is closely tied to the current situation of the American economy, and before we get to that, it's better to first take a primer on the current situation.For the banking and stock markets, along with the corporate world in general, the main topic of discussion for the past twelve months now is the Federal Reserve Bank. Known as the Fed, the central bank is responsible for defending the U.S. dollar's purchasing power against inflationary pressures, and after it reduced interest rates to a record low due to the coronavirus pandemic, it has spent the past year in course correction to bring down inflation. This has seen the Fed hike interest rates by a massive 4.25 percentage points since March 16 last year, as it aims to reduce the demand for capital in the market and control the flow of currency to bring down goods and services prices as a consequence.However, these are not the only consequences of the monetary policy shifts. Another direct result of rising interest rates comes in the form of higher bond yields. For the uninitiated, a bond's yield is its interest payment divided by its price (the interest rate is fixed). So, since the interest payment is fixed for previously issued bonds, if the Fed raises interest rates, the prices of the low rate bonds fall in the market and their yields start to rise. This dynamic sits at the heart of the SVB collapse, as the bank had heavily bought these bonds during the coronavirus pandemic when interest rates were low. What made it buy these bonds? Well, back then, the bank's deposits had soared to a whopping $124 billion from an earlier $62 billion, at a pace that saw it beat much larger rivals such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as SVB's client based, mostly consisting of the technology industry, saw its fortunes rise with the technology sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesThis large deposit base was made up of unstable money that belonged to companies and venture capital firms - both of which could withdraw it at a moment's notice and leave SVB without adequate funds to cover its obligations. Since these deposits accrued faster than the bank's customers required money, SVB had to invest them into securities. This investment decision is at the heart of its collapse and the impact of the Fed's rate hike induced yield spiral. At this point in the decision making cycle, banks can choose to either invest the funds into available for sale or held to maturity securities. The former enables the bank to quickly recover the money without taking losses, but the latter requires it to take a haircut if the bonds are sold before their maturity date - a fact that bit SVB hard when the interest rate hike drove down the prices of older bonds since between 2019 and today, while its available for sale portfolio grew by 93%, its held to maturity portfolio grew by a stunning 607%! At the same time, the bank's balance sheet at the end of December 2022 revealed that $86 billion of its $91 billion HTM securities were expected to mature after ten years. Out of these $ 91 billion dollars of HTM securities, the bank booked an unbelievable $15.160 billion in unrealized losses in its last fiscal year. These losses shocked the market when SVB announced that it would sell $2.5 billion in shares to help buffer them, sending its shares tumbling by 60%.Yet, still, for those unfamiliar with banking regulations, the impact of all this will be lost at this point. To ensure that banks do not become insolvent after booking these losses, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) requires banks to hold core capital that consisted primarily of its own equity to ensure that the losses can be covered and the bank does not run out of money. This capital is called Tier 1 Capital, and when it's divided by the bank's total assets this leads to the Tier 1 Capital Ratio - a percentage used by regulators to evaluate bank health. For SVB, according to JPMorgan, once the unrealized losses were accounted for, this ratio dropped to below 1% from an earlier reading of 12%. JPMorgan's own ratio sits a little over 13% and drops a little below 12% once the unrealized losses are accounted for.As JPMorgan points out:While capital, wholesale funding and loan to deposit ratios improved for many US banks since 2008, there are exceptions. As shown in the first chart, SIVB was in a league of its own: a high level of loans plus securities as a percentage of deposits, and very low reliance on stickier retail deposits as a share of total deposits. Bottom line: SIVB carved out a distinct and riskier niche than other banks, setting itself up for large potential capital shortfalls in case of rising interest rates, deposit outflows and forced asset sales.With these gory details in mind, today we'll look at some bank stocks that hedge funds were piling into at the end of 2022. Out of these, the top three are Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge FundsSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.2022 was terrible for the equities market, as inflation reached new highs and took interest rates with it. The Fed showed no signs of slowing down until the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 got off to a decent start as the Fed issued a less aggressive rate hike and raised interest rates by 25 basis points at the February meeting. However, inflation is still running at roughly 3 times the target rate of 2%. Economists and analysts are divided on what the Fed will do at the next FOMC meeting in March and what is ahead for the economy.Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director: ""The Downturn Is Closer Than We Thought A Week Ago""On March 14 senior managing director at Evercore ISI, Julian Emanuel, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the market situation in the aftermath of the SVB crisis. Julian Emanuel said that year-end expectations for interest rates are on a wide spread, between 375 basis points and 525 basis points, and so one cannot predict interest rates with absolute certainty in the current environment. Julian Emanuel said that the Fed funds rate is dependent on economic data, and more importantly, it is dependent on the reaction of the markets to that data. In the case that we end 2023 with a Fed funds rate of 375 basis points, it could be both good or bad for the stock market, said Julian Emanuel. He said that if Fed tightening caused the collapse of SVB, the U.S. might end up in a mild recession. However, in the event of a mild recession, Julian Emanuel thinks that the market will hit a necessary bottom that will create an entry point for investors ""that will launch the next bull market phase"". Julian Emanuel reiterated how uncertain and volatile the current market situation is. He also said that before the SVB fallout, his clients were talking about how ""the no landing scenario was operative"", but now that does not seem like the case. Here are some comments from Julian Emanuel about what he expects for the markets ahead:Story continues""Part of the endgame is, we do wanna see a enough of a downturn to make stocks attractive, to cause this cathartic moment, where we can reset and multiples can begin expanding as the economic cycle turns. But we're still a ways from that. However, I would suggest whereas people were thinking this could last into '24, it does feel like the downturn is closer than we thought a week ago.""In the current market environment, many stocks have made new lows. However, it can be argued that some of these companies may be presenting attractive buying opportunities for investors. There are companies that have institutional participation and positive analyst sentiment that have crashed to their 52-week lows. However, it is possible that hedge funds either underestimated the risks associated with these companies or are optimistic about their future performance despite the current decline. Analysts who are positive about the companies may be focusing on their potential for long-term growth, rather than short-term challenges. Ultimately, it's unclear whether these companies are truly the best investment opportunities and so it is important for investors to conduct their own research and due diligence to make informed decisions. Some of the best 52-week low stocks to buy now according to analysts and hedge funds include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Pfizer Inc.

It provides attentive service and takes almost no credit risk on loans. A typical First Republic loan might be for 50% of the purchase price of a luxury home in Silicon Valley to an executive whose net worth is multiples of the value of the home. The bank has more than doubled revenue and net income over the past five years. In 2022, it grew household relationships by 15%, a remarkable number for a bank. But First Republic also got pinched in 2022 by the phenomenon of interest rates rising faster for short-term loans than for long-term loans. This happens because the market expects a recession: it costs more to borrow money for a year than for 10 years. For First Republic, this means it is paying high rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to customers, but then lending that money to long-term borrowers for only a bit more yield. Banks depend on a healthy spread between their cost of deposits and what they earn on loans. Lately, First Republic’s net interest margin has been disappointing. Still, earnings per share grew about 7% in 2022.The inversion of the yield curve may continue to pinch earnings growth in 2023, but longer-term First Republic continues to attract affluent customers and, as such, to grow low-risk loan volumes. When you don’t have credit losses and you do have steadily growing loan volumes, income should rise over time.With cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale of ICE in the fourth quarter, we invested more money in existing holdings First Republic Bank, M&amp;T Bank, Carmax, Floor &amp; Décor and SS&amp;C. We ended the year with about 2.5% cash.”13. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Baxter International Inc.

Has this asset stalled or is it a mid-teens grower? Other factors will determine the one true answer to this question, though FX and the stated headline make the answer seem obvious when it is not. When foreign exchange movements are modest, people tend to focus more on FX neutral assuming those changes will normalize over time, yet when movements are extreme the headline takes prominence.”Some of the most popular stocks that have hit new lows and are still held by hedge funds include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Pfizer Inc.

I'm delighted to be here with you as we report our fourth quarter and full year '22 financial results. As noted in the headlines of our release, our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was 23% for the fourth quarter and 27% for fiscal year 2022. These are fabulous results, and I am grateful to the entire Westrock Coffee team who worked tirelessly all year to deliver them. Ask anyone on the team and they can tell you '22 was a year of unbelievable accomplishments amidst staggering challenges.We became a public company during a very difficult time for the public equity markets and have been one of the best performing new issues of '22. This transaction allowed us to delever our balance sheet and provided us access to enough capital to build out not only the first, but also the second phase of our new Conway, Arkansas extract and ready-to-drink facility. With well over half of the capacity of this combined facility already under sales contracts with leading RTD coffee brands, we are excited to be positioned to enter a completely new era of EBITDA creation over the next 2 to 3 years. And while we plan for the future, we operate in the here and now.In 2022, we encountered a significant number of operational level challenges. We began '22 with the onset of the Omicron COVID variant, which delayed an expected economic recovery and then faced a surge of inflation and gasoline price hikes through the summer, all of which negatively impacted our business. Our year ended with the late arrival of significant production equipment for our single-serve and extract units, which created customer delivery issues and negatively impacted our cost and margins. Our team had to fight for every intra progress in every season of what could have otherwise been a fairly impressive and reasonably easy year.Yet through all the good and the bad of 2022, our team worked tirelessly to deliver record adjusted EBITDA of up 20%, while also making significant advances on integrating and improving our internal operations, sales and support functions. These advances, coupled with the recent arrival and onboarding of our long-delayed manufacturing equipment have set us up for another record year in 2023, even as we continue to spend as needed to build the scaled platform necessary to monetize the value of our new Conway extracts and RTD plant, which, when fully online is set to expand our EBITDA, not by percentage factors, but quite possibly by multiples.Before I turn the call over to Chris Pledger, our CFO, let me say a word about 2 acquisitions we made over the past few months. In November, we closed on the acquisition of Kohana Coffee, an extract and RTD business in Richmond, California. This acquisition was important for us and that it allowed us to add several new customers on our beverage solutions platform and more importantly, it allowed us to accelerate the development, production and distribution of RTD products in cans and multi-serve bottles for key existing customers.Similarly, the acquisition of Bixby Roasting in February allowed us to expand our growing influencer-led sales channel and add 2 outstanding sales executives to our team. Miles Fisher and Remington Hotchkis are going to be impact players for Westrock Coffee over time. These kinds of incremental gains expand our platform and help drive growth as we build for our future. They are exactly the kind of acquisition opportunities we remain focused on today.With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our recent financial performance.Thomas Christopher PledgerThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter and our full year 2022 results, and then I'll provide some commentary on our outlook for 2023.Total company net sales for the fourth quarter increased 20% year-over-year to $227.7 million, while gross profit, excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustment, decreased $1 million to $37 million. Our sales growth was driven by a 57% increase in single serve cup volumes and increased pricing from the pass-through of higher underlying green coffee prices for the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 6% decrease in roast and ground coffee volumes.The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was driven by higher material and production labor costs due to inflation in period and out-of-period inventory adjustments and our continued efforts to absorb the 57% growth year-over-year in single-serve cup volume. Despite these headwinds, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $17.5 million, an increase of approximately 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by reductions in SG&amp;A primarily related to personnel cost savings.For the full year 2022, net sales were $867.9 million, while gross profit, excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustment was $156.3 million, an increase of 10% compared to full year 2021. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for 2022 grew 27% to $60.1 million, coming in at the low end of our guided range.As we outlined in our third quarter call, our 2022 financial results were impacted by 3 main factors: first, the Omicron COVID variant in the first quarter, followed by rapidly rising inflation through the middle part of the year had a significant negative impact on U.S. consumer spending. This impacted our business in the form of lower product sales in our away-from-home channels, particularly in restaurants and convenience stores and inflation impacted labor costs, freight and material costs across all of our products.Second, it took longer and cost more in terms of equipment, labor and materials to absorb the 50% year-over-year growth in our single-serve cup orders. As Scott mentioned, we have put additional manufacturing equipment into service in the first quarter of 2023, which is leveling out these service issues, and we have additional equipment coming online in the second quarter, which will free up additional capacity.As we continue to grow our single-serve platform, we feel very good about our ability to more efficiently monetize these increased product volumes. Finally, our team has performed really well in 2022, staying disciplined and focusing on the levers we have to pull in order to respond to these significant macroeconomic and operational challenges.On a segment basis, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $192.6 million in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents year-over-year growth of 28%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $15.2 million, increasing 31% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, our Beverage Solutions segment generated $54 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 30% increase over 2021, driven by 50% growth in our single-serve cup volume and 8% growth in our flavors, extracts and ingredients products, which were partially offset by a 7% decrease in roast and ground coffee volumes.As we've said before, an important part of our growth algorithm is the mix shift over time into our higher-margin single-serve and flavors, extracts and ingredient products. We continue to see that shift in customer demand and our 2022 results validate this continuing trend.Turning towards our sustainable sourcing and traceability segment for SS&amp;T, sales net of intersegment revenues were $35.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased volumes in the quarter.For the full year, our S&amp;T segment contributed sales net of intersegment revenues of $182.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million, growing 24% and 7%, respectively, compared to 2021. These increases are driven by a higher average sales price per pound for green coffee, which grew 35% year-over-year as sales volume decreased approximately 9% from 2021 levels. The increase in average sales price per pound is directly correlated to global commodity prices. During the year, the volume of green coffee from our SS&amp;P segment that is utilized by our Beverage Solutions segment grew 173%, which is important and that it keeps margin within the system, and it expands the coverage of our traceable and transparent supply chain.With respect to our capital expenditures, during the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of CapEx, $30 million of which was growth capital related to our extract and RTD facility in Conway, Arkansas. These expenditures primarily consisted of infrastructure spending and equipment deposits for our glass and can lines. In addition, we incurred $5 million of gross CapEx tied to the continued single-serve capacity expansion in our Little Rock, Arkansas facility. This single-serve CapEx is already having a benefit in 2023 as new machines are allowing us to increase production to align with customer demand and to improve the overall efficiency of our single-serve cup operation.On a project basis, we continue to anticipate that the total CapEx cost of Phases 1 and 2 of our Conway extract in RTD facility will be $275 million, and that once it's fully online, we will generate approximately $100 million in EBITDA per year. As Scott mentioned, this project remains on time and on budget, and we look forward to the first product being produced in Conway in the first quarter of 2024.At quarter end, we had approximately $192 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio at December 31 was 2.9x based on fourth quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA. We believe we have ample access to liquidity to achieve our near-term growth targets and capital expenditure needs. As we look ahead to 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 10% and 25%, which translates to a range of $66 million to $75 million in adjusted EBITDA. This guidance represents our current expectations regarding the performance of the business. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.We expect our 2023 financial performance to be driven by several significant new customer and product wins that will come online in 2023. Growth in our extract volume as our expansion project in Concord, North Carolina is complete in May, and we benefit from the volume growth that expansion allows. Growth in single cup volumes as we get the full year benefit of the increased single-serve volume we experienced in the second half of 2022, and Growth in RTE can sales as we continue to scale our operations in Richmond, California and operational improvements we are putting in place to more efficiently monetize all of these opportunities.We will continue to closely manage costs in our existing business while we continue to invest in the equipment and more importantly, in the team that will deliver the growth to come from our Conway extract and RTD facility in 2024. With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Todd Brooks of Benchmark.Todd Morrison BrooksA couple of questions for you. One, just looking back to the equipment delay that you talked about in -- later in Q4 that's kind of slid into Q1. Is there any to size the impact so that we can think about and what type of drag that was on Q4 results?Scott Thomas FordYes. This is Scott, hey, Todd. Well, frankly, you would get a debate. The reality is those are the main line that was late was due in October and is now coming in, in May. It was coming out of Europe where everybody was kind of slow to get back going. We were able to fill part of that gap by going to Israel and getting a couple of machines that could alleviate, I would say, most of the burden of being caught short. And if you look at the aggregate picture, absent that, I think it probably cost us a few million bucks. There are people that would say, well, on a net-net basis because orders came in, in this sequence instead of that one, it might not have cost us quite that much. But I think it probably cost us a few million dollars in EBITDA, and it was a major pain in the neck with our customers. So it was a really nasty spell.But I'd say the good news that came out of that is when we look at all of the things that are going on in Conway, we've changed all of our program management, and we now put every call, every vendor on the phone every week and we are doing site visits to actually see it. Don't tell me that it's being done. We're going to send somebody our Head of Engineering in Europe for the next 3 weeks right now of walking through and laying eyes on exactly the machine that's coming our way, and we've changed some of the payment terms so that we kind of get some of that level back out. So there's a multitude of factors there. Almost all of them are bad and almost all of them are now behind.Todd Morrison BrooksGreat, thanks Scott. And then I think when you were talking about 50% of the capacity under contract at Conway, you're not talking about the blended capacity between Phase 1 and Phase 2, correct? So you've actually filled some more of that incremental capacity with the 2 new phases during the course of this quarter?Scott Thomas FordYes. So you're right. It is -- we are referencing not only Phase 1, but Phase 2. And the thing that I would say that is the most important to take away from the Conway expansion is that as we accelerated liquid extract into that facility, which we used to do in North Carolina, and we were playing around when and if to bring that into Conway, bringing liquid extract in at the scale we are bringing to them will support our customers' other bottling facilities where they desperately need help. It will help support our operations on the West Coast and the East Coast and it is engendering a number of conversations about products, SKUs and customer relationships that, quite frankly, were never on our list of, I would say, benefits that came out of accelerating the liquid extract space.So 50% is a rough number for the whole combined series of packaging lines that are going in, but the acceleration of the extract manufacturing is what is really starting to change the conversation with our customers because the need for these it's really hard to explain the depth of the need that is in the market for these products right now.Todd Morrison BrooksThat's great. Scott, one more for Chris, and then I'll hop back in queue. Chris, when you look at the forward guidance for EBITDA growth of 10% to 25%, as you're looking at variables that drive you to one end of that spectrum or the other, can you highlight 2 or 3 that would unlock where you land in that guidance range?Thomas Christopher PledgerYes. I think it's a couple of things. I think as we looked at it this year, we weren't going to make any predictions about what was going to happen with inflation. We just took the year as it is and just assume that it would continue the way that it is. So bad things could happen and it could continue to impact customer demand and that would negatively impact our ability to hit the higher end of that range, that would put you to the lower end of the range.The other thing that I'm excited about this year is that we've got a number of new customer and new product wins. And the lion's share of those wins are in our single-serve and our extract side of the business, which is we talk about our growth algorithm and being able to move to the higher-margin part of the business, being able to accelerate that into 2023, recognizing that, that's going to be a huge part of the story in 2024 is a huge plus and I guess, tailwind for the business. So being able to deliver those customers, we don't always control exactly the timing of when those customer contracts will come online. But having those customers come online when they expect -- when we expect them to, with the volumes that we expect to have them is something that would plus or minus, provide some sort of benefit to us being towards the top range -- the higher range of the guidance.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Sarang Vora of Telsey Group.Sarang VoraJust staying on the guidance on the prior question on the guidance. How do you -- the beverage solution is the main segment over here. It seems like sales were stronger in the fourth quarter. It seems like new customer are onboarding as you look out at 23%. So help us understand the -- if you can provide any sales outlook or a range or color on how we should think about sales in '23, especially beverage solutions versus SS&amp;T. It seems like SS&amp;T is primarily impacted by lower coffee prices. But it's just a forward future business versus the core business, which is beverage solutions. So can you help us underpin any color on the sales for '23, like how we should think between the segments?Scott Thomas FordWe talked a lot about this and whether or not it was really valuable to put sales guidance out in addition to EBITDA guidance and recognize that we had done that as part of the leaseback transaction. But when you look at -- and we talked about this on prior calls, and I know we've had these conversations around the impact of the commodity price on our sales because we don't know what that's going to be, it's hard to put guidance on where the feed price is. If you think about last year, we sort of planned for the C price to be around 220 for the year.And if you look at where it is now, it'd be below that as you embark into 2023. But the reality is that we don't know where that's going to stay for the year, whether it's going to go up or down. And given the pass-through nature of coffee in our net sales, it's just -- it's something that we decided not to provide guidance on. I think when you see the growth in the customers and the new products, net sales is clearly going to go up from where it is now, but a lower commodity price is going to offset the sales, which is why we continue to focus everybody on our EBITDA generation.Sarang VoraThat's good. And I just have a quick follow-up on the Conway. It seems like demand trends for the Conway facility are very strong. Can you provide any color on customer profile that's getting attracted or type of product like cans as well as any milestones like we should track for the year saying equipment delays or talent acquisition. Like how are you planning the rollout until like for the Conway facility? Any milestones you can share as you monitor?Scott Thomas FordYes. Good. All good questions. And it sounds like you've been sitting in on our daily meetings on the Conway project. So the team has come together very nicely. We probably have a dozen people that are leading experts in their field from an engineering perspective, from a plant general manager perspective, from a quality insurance perspective, from a financial expert that had multiple plants reporting up to her. We have put together a -- really, it's impressive. And we just took our Board through at the end of the day, and we've got a very season. I think we have a Fortune 500 board and they were absolutely blown away with the talent and the individual backgrounds of the people that we have brought on to run this Conway projects. We're feeling super about the people.You then get down to being on time, on budget. On time, we are on time. We're actually slightly ahead, maybe up to 30 to 60 days on some of the first phases of the general contracting work. Then you get down to on budget. On budget, we are so far actually slightly ahead of budget. So we don't keep those advantages, but we're out of the blocks and around the first lap in good position. We've got a good crew. We're on time. We're all in budget. And then on the other side of it is the customer reaction to being willing to put in pieces of equipment. This is a little bit why you go back to Todd's question a moment ago, well, how are you counting Phase 1 and Phase 2?Well, they are morphing because as customers come in and say, hold on, I need you to put in this piece of kind of equipment, and you put in a small can line. You need you to put in a large can of lime. I need you to put in a glass funnel and I need a multi-serve bottle with the following characteristics versus one with another set of characteristics. As we've been working with our customers, and these are the major coffee brands in the world, both at the start-up level, whether you're a West Coast startup phenomenon, an influencer-led brand or you're one of the staple coffee brands in the country.The chances are very likely you're going to end up being a customer of this facility. And we are doing not the steel too many algebra literation. But we are doing the algebra of what takes care of the most customers to maximize our EBITDA in that facility and meets their needs so that we remain their primary first solution. And that's not an tricky, that is a fairly tricky proposition, but we're making great progress on it. The sales force is going back out here in the next month with all new sales literature, all new capacities. And frankly, if half to 2/3 of the people that tell us what they want, actually come through and go all the way through the contracting, we're oversold by a large amount. So we have over -- we are over-indexed on demand for any of our capacity and several of the lines are already 100% full.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bienvenu of Stevens.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuJim Salera on for Ben. I need to ask on the competitive landscape and how that looks today. Is the launch of the Conway facility and as you guys ramp up kind of making waves or is it not going noticed by your competitors?Scott Thomas FordNo. Everybody in the industry knows about it. It's a fairly small industry. People smaller than us are trying to figure out how they can actually do handoffs up to the scale impact that we bring to their product line, people that compete with us are ratcheting down and fighting harder and people that are bigger than us are absolutely -- I seem to be absolutely enrolled about what we've done and how that fits in their view of the world long term, all of that's going on.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. Great. And maybe a follow-up on the last question. Overall kind of macro factors, I mean, you guys have seen really strong demand thus far. Is there any risk that if the economy worsens or the consumer ends up in a tougher position that some of that demand rolls off?Scott Thomas FordYes, sure. There is, obviously. A lot of our products are not particularly that sensitive to macroeconomics but a lot of like black coffee at (inaudible), it is. And so when you go back to Chris' point about where are we in the 10% to 25% growth in EBITDA, where do we land? A lot of it depends on kind of the assumption you make around that because we are assuming that what it is today is all through the year. And that's a little bit of a break from where we were last year when we were trying to guess when people were coming back to the office, when COVID was going to abate and people were going to start traveling again.We actually built some guesses like that into our numbers. This year, we said, we know we don't know. Just build it if they're here today and buying that volume, carry it forward, add the new wins and just build it that way and don't get us. So that's how we did it. But Jim, you come all the way back around to if we're half right on this. We're not coming back to the equity market to get any more money from this market anytime in the foreseeable future. Because if we can get to these kinds of EBITDA numbers, our ability to carry the financing through the expanded credit facilities that Chris and his team have brought in all this, hey, now that you've done an offering, you've got to come back and do another offering and put out a bunch of stock.It is not likely to happen if we get anywhere close to these numbers. And so that's kind of the other side of the loop, which our Board is a shareholder owning board, and they have 0 interest in selling equity anywhere near these prices. And so we went out and structured the whole leaseback and credit arrangement where if we can hit numbers like what Chris has laid out in our guidance, we never have to go back to the equity market. And so that's -- you can pretty well assured as the largest single shareholder. I'm really hard bet on that one, and I've got everybody's attention around here on a daily basis to deliver against that.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuGreat. And then maybe one last question if I can sneak in for Chris. Just kind of segueing off that answer. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your capital position today and kind of where the balance sheet positions you to make all, check off all the boxes in your growth plans?Thomas Christopher PledgerYes. So I mean as we finish the year, we had $17 million in cash, and we had a completely undrawn $175 million revolver. You saw the announcement earlier this -- in the first quarter where we added the $50 million of incremental borrowing capacity to our delays -- in the form of delayed draw term loan, which gives us additional access to capital. And then we're looking at ways that you can maximize working capital in order to be able to make sure that we have all the liquidity we need in order to execute. And so we feel really good about where we are. I mean, like Scott said, we plan the whole transaction for building out Conway. And as long as we continue to stay disciplined, we continue to deliver, we have no concerns about being able to do that.OperatorWe do have a follow-up question from Todd Brooks of Benchmark.Todd Morrison BrooksA couple of follow-up questions here. First, Scott, if you -- and this is my ignorance on the coffee market. But if you could talk about Bixby and what these influencer brands mean and what their skill set and capability really unlocks for Westrock as you pull that operation in?Scott Thomas FordSure. So it's a reasonably small business as it sits today, but they probably have the leading infuser brand market position on the West Coast. And as you go through, there was a great article -- sorry, Todd, I'll see if I can find it and send it back around to you, but there was a great article about it used to be that people would say, I have a product idea. Now I have a method of creating a brand, and now I'm going to spend money to create product awareness and brand affinity with the consumer. And now I'm going to actually pay people to put it on the shelf. That entire retail model has been turned upside down by the digital revolution.So you now have people that have already built brands, they might be wrestlers, boxes or makeup artists or guitarist, I don't know. But they've built a brand where they have literally tens of millions of followers who want to be associated with these people, these influencers. So what Miles Fisher and Remington Hotchkis had done which is a lot like what [Elizabeth Galfan] here in our group had started a small group in this kind of minds this vein. They had actually built a kitchen or a roasting facility in California, where these influencers can come in and actually start to try products, create products. And then we've brought in the scaled manufacturing and purchasing power behind it so that these people can scale up really quickly.And we're talking about getting into as an illustration, all of the Walmart, all of the targets. These are the kind of brands that are going in there. They go from 0 to full product arrays in less than 9 months. And so this is really a sales force and a selling site acquisition for us. We're really high on these 2 guys and their small team. They now work on Elizabeth team. And we already had probably the leading influencer brand coffee launch customer already in our stable. So putting those together and having them sheet actually out there on the West Coast right now, focused on developing the full strategy to deliver not only roast and ground products, single-serve products, but you're going to see a lot of these folks have a mass following that will get them in the ready-to-drink space. So pretty exciting just from a sales perspective.Todd Morrison BrooksOkay. And then Chris, one follow-up for you. And maybe not quantifying the exact gross margin percentages in a product segment. But if you look at a May delivery of that key piece of equipment in the single-serve side, if you were looking at maybe first half versus second half '23 gross margins for single-serve, just what type of basis point lift would you expect to see between the 2 halves once you're fully equipped to really ramp into this new business that you brought on?Thomas Christopher PledgerIt should be -- I mean, it should be somewhat significant. I think the key -- what happens when you have the necessary equipment to meet the volume that you're trying to produce and the throughput that you have, you're able to really look at your production from a portfolio basis. And so not only having the machines but having machines allows you to be able to do their preventative maintenance. It allows you to be able to pick and choose what you're going to turn on win in order to be able to maximize the throughput that you need. And so it's not just about volume. It's also about being able to produce more efficiently and with less waste.And so we're excited about a couple of those machines that Scott mentioned that came in in the first quarter. We've got the other machinery coming in, in the second quarter. And what that really does is it allows -- it gives us the flexibility and the comfort to be able to execute on the single-serve cup volume in a more stable manner. And when you do that, there are benefits throughout the entire platform to being able to do that.Todd Morrison BrooksIf I was kind of drawing a glide path for it, we'd see meaningful improvement in the second half, but probably annualized that segment of solutions getting to where you want in '24 that...Thomas Christopher PledgerCorrect. I think it will be a little -- a small improvement in the first half. I think you'll see a bigger improvement in the second half.OperatorThank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Scott Ford, CEO, for any closing remarks.Scott Thomas FordWell, thank you all for joining us. It has been (inaudible) in 2022. And we really are focused right now on making sure that the issues that we are dealing with from getting new equipment into the single-serve and getting back to full scale is effectively and timely delivered. We are also working through a series of system conversions that we went through at the beginning of the year in North Carolina in the traditional SMB business. We have basically caught up with all of those issues coming out of the other side of the system conversion.We have new extract facilities that are turning on in the first half of the year this year in North Carolina. That is kind of the bridge that creates the fiscal year '23 outlook. And then we have Conway on time to start up in the first quarter of '24 and we are simply focused on trying to put several years together in a row of growth rates like the one that you just experienced here. This one was a little harder to make than we would have thought. I'm sure there'll be new things in '23, but the team has really started to gel. We are only doing some small acquisitions.We're not -- we've had people do this financing to this big deal, do this big deal, and we're like, look, we are focusing, we are simplifying and we are executing. And that is what 2022, I will pause and give Jeff Fox $5 for creating that freight because I did steal it. But that is really the sum total of what we're working on in 2023. Thank you for being with us today. I hope you have a great evening. Thanks. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.]"

Now US officials allege he’s at the center of a suspected secret supply chain that prosecutors say used American technology to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.Most Read from BloombergUS Studies Ways to Insure All Bank Deposits If Crisis GrowsUBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3.3 Billion Deal to End CrisisJPMorgan Owned the LME ‘Nickel’ That Was Actually Bags of StonesVanguard Said to Shutter Business in China, Exit Ant VentureJPMorgan Sees Increasing Chances of ‘Minsky Moment’The son of a Siberian governor was arrested last year on charges that he and his associates defrauded the US and its companies and also violated sanctions by selling sensitive technologies from the US to Russia via intermediaries in non-sanctioned countries. He’s the most politically connected Russian to be indicted by the US as Washington races to choke off Moscow’s access to chips used in weapons systems. Uss has denied any wrongdoing and is now in the midst of an extradition battle in Milan.Court documents from the Uss case and others like it show how Russia allegedly built a secret pipeline for years before the war to ensure the supply of semiconductors to the country despite US controls. Those well-honed tactics are now helping Russian operators rebuild dismantled networks and deceive publicly listed US tech companies, according to customs data, indictments and people familiar with the matter, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media.American prosecutors haven’t identified the semiconductor manufacturers who may have sold to Uss’s team unwittingly, and he is now under house arrest in Milan. Even so, US and EU officials say that Russia is still able to get chips and technology for military use through other networks. Customs data analyzed by the British think tank Royal United Services Institute and seen by Bloomberg also show that semiconductors made by large companies including Analog Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Microchip Technology Inc. have been getting to Russia via third-party firms in other parts of the world for months after the war started. The companies say they follow the law, don’t sell to Russia and they haven’t authorized the sale of their products there.Story continues“We should be assuming that much of our sensitive technologies are making their way into the wrong hands,” said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner and chair of the national security practice at Washington-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, who served as a senior official at the US Department of Commerce. “The third-party intermediary problem is a fairly easy and significant loophole.”For more, read: Russia Is Getting Round Sanctions to Buy Key Chips for Its WarUss and his associates allegedly operated before and after the invasion, according to a US indictment. Prosecutors say they set up small shell companies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia — essentially Trojan horses to convince chip-makers in California, Pennsylvania and New York that they were selling to non-sanctioned jurisdictions.They fabricated certificates that falsified the end user, the charges allege. One front company they set up in Malaysia had several addresses, but only one had a visible sign and even that was located in an empty room in a strip mall, the prosecutors allege. The items were ultimately sent to customers in Russia, including US-sanctioned defense contractors, the indictment says.The same indictment also accuses Uss’s team of simultaneously profiting by selling sanctioned Venezuelan oil. The Russian defendants are also charged with defrauding US banks.Listen to The Big Take Podcast episode: How Are US Chips Ending Up in Russian Weapons?Uss, 40, says he didn’t do anything wrong, isn’t responsible for anything his associates may have allegedly done, and argues that he shouldn’t be extradited because he risks being treated unfairly in the US, people familiar with his legal defense say, declining to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. Dressed in a dark gray suit as he left his closed door hearing in Milan in February, he declined to comment. His lawyers also declined to answer questions.The US has had restrictions on Russian purchases of military-related technology for years, but it’s been sharply accelerating those controls since Putin invaded Ukraine in February last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia doesn’t consider the restrictions placed by US “legal from the point of view of international law.”“Sanctions are what has been decided on by the UN Security Council — these are nothing more than unilateral, illegal restrictions,” Peskov said.Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important to the outcome of the war. Russia has been ramping up its push to get chips, suggesting its stockpiles aren’t deep enough and Moscow’s efforts are unlikely to have resolved shortages, said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.Ukraine’s government has publicly urged tech giants including Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. to stop making microchips that it says support Russia’s Glonass satellite navigation system. Representatives at Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment.Analog Devices in a statement said that any post-sanctions shipments into Russia, the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine and Belarus is a direct violation of its policies “and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products.” The company has ramped up monitoring of gray market activities, it said.Microchip also said in a statement that it doesn’t sell to sanctioned regions and works on screening customers.“We do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren’t designed for,” Texas Instruments said in a statement, adding that it doesn’t sell into Russia or Belarus.In addition to Uss, the US charged six other individuals in October, including Yury Orekhov, whom it identified as a former employee at a Russian aluminum firm. Lawyers for Orekhov didn’t respond to a request for comment.The team “engaged in a variety of activities in violation of US laws and regulations sanctions, including the unlawful export of millions of US dollars in military and sensitive dual-use technologies from the United States to Russia, and the use of the US financial system to smuggle millions of barrels of embargoed oil from Venezuela,” the charges said.In a press release, the US Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, which filed the charges, said this alleged network “schemed to procure sophisticated technology in direct support of a floundering Russian Federation military industrial complex.”They used fake purchase orders, business records and shipping documents to fool American chipmakers, the court documents allege. All that helped mask the end user: The Russian military, according to prosecutors. Illicit deliveries continued after Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022 attack on Ukraine, at least until the end of March that year, prosecutors said. Components made by several of the US companies were found in seized Russian weapons platforms in Ukraine, the charges said.At other times, Uss’s associates falsely told US chipmakers that their products were headed to Roscosmos, the Russian space program that still has cooperative agreements with NASA, according to the charges. A spokesperson at NASA declined to comment.Orekhov shuttled between Germany and Dubai, where he had a property on the pricey artificial island of Palm Jumeirah, according to US prosecutors. He relied on companies based in the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Russia and Malaysia, the indictment said.Both Uss and Orekhov got involved in the scheme after the US blacklisted another co-defendant Timofey Telegin and his defense contracting firm in 2018, court documents allege. Telegin had come under scrutiny after two of his employees were detained in the US on charges of trying to illegally acquire sensitive military technology two years earlier, according to court documents. No lawyers for Telegin have filed public notices of appearances and he couldn't be reached for comment about the case.Russia is constantly seeking new loopholes as US pressure builds, according to Adam Smith, a former top Treasury official who worked on Russia sanctions policy and is now at the law firm Gibson Dunn. “There are perhaps two hundred other jurisdictions they could potentially leverage.”The analysis by the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, showed that nearly all the American semiconductors that reached Russia in recent customs data were bought by companies in China and eventually reached the manufacturer of Russia’s Orlan-10 drones.Biden officials have raised concerns about Russia’s access to chips with other countries, including China and the UAE, according to people with knowledge of the conversations, who weren’t authorized to speak to the media. A spokesperson at the Department of Commerce said the US will continue to communicate with other countries about its controls, monitor developments and “act as appropriate to deny Russia the items it needs to sustain its war machine.”Unlike the EU and US, China and the UAE don’t have sanctions on Russia.“The UAE adheres to, and strictly enforces, international laws and UN mandated sanctions, alongside agreements established with international partners, including the US,” a UAE official said in a statement to Bloomberg. The Middle Eastern country says it has systems in place to monitor illicit fund flows and has put in sophisticated customs systems to monitor products, including sensitive technologies.China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it isn’t aware of the details surrounding the chips issue and its stance is to promote peace and talks in Ukraine. The US has frequently spread false information on the subject of China’s relations with Russia, it said.US and EU officials have said that Russia also continues to access foreign chips and technology through intermediaries like Iran, Turkey, the UAE and Kazakhstan.The US in February sanctioned a Swiss-Italian businessman, accusing him and his associates of using companies in the UAE, Switzerland, Malta and Bulgaria for acquiring sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russia intelligence and military.In Italy, meanwhile, Uss remains under house arrest. He faces up to 30 years in a US prison if extradited. The Milan tribunal is yet to rule on the US extradition request.The indictment says that Uss’s alleged involvement in the chips smuggling started in 2018, the same year his father secured election as governor of the resource-rich Krasnoyarsk region.On social media, Uss’s father, Alexander, who is a member of the ruling party, has denounced the case against his son as fabricated by the US. “The political nature of these accusations is obvious,” he said in a Telegram post.The US sanctioned both father and son in December. Alexander Uss didn’t respond to requests for comment submitted via his press service.Russia, meanwhile, has put the younger Uss on a wanted list for alleged money-laundering and is asking for his handover. Uss in mid-January asked the Milan court hearing his extradition case to send him instead to Russia to face charges, the Russian state news service Tass reported.Although the US said in June last year that Russian semiconductor imports were slashed by 90% because of its curbs, the US industry association warned in January of the “broad challenges in preventing the illicit purchase and counterfeiting” of American chips.Read more: Putin Stirs EU Worry on Home Appliance Imports Stripped for ArmsAlso frustrating US efforts to limit the trade, Moscow has switched its focus to acquiring less advanced consumer-grade components that are easier to procure, Bloomberg News has reported.“This is ultimately a contest of wills,” said James Byrne, an expert in technology and security at RUSI. “The Russians need this, it’s critical to their military program, so they have to acquire it.

245,26f87f21-405c-3817-92be-5f61fe13386b,ADI,2023-03-15,3 Solid Buys from the Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-solid-buys-semiconductor-industry-170005747.html,1678813205,STORY,"['MCHP', 'SLAB', 'ADI']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient.  Our current picks are Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).About the IndustryThis industry includes mostly semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel Corporation (INTC).Major Themes for the IndustryThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.Story continuesThe industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Data center demand has also dropped off sharper than expected as leading tech players absorbed the reduction in advertising demand. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains. The situation is expected to gradually improve as we get into the second half partly because some of the demand is expected to come back, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn’t have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That’s because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As semiconductors become important in defense, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Relatively Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it in the top 23% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, it appears that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook has improved while that for 2024 has weakened slightly: 2023 estimates have risen 5.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 3.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveThe Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the S&amp;P 500 through most of the past year and starting from November it has pulled way ahead as the S&amp;P essentially flatlined. The broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector has trailed the S&amp;P 500 since April.Overall, the industry gained 13.1% over the past year while the broader sector lost 14.1% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.0%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 17.12X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.33X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 21.22X. At the current level, it is however trading at a premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between a 13.80X and 18.74X multiple over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devices’ strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. Demand in these markets, particularly for automation and electrification are currently driving its business. These along with pervasive sensing, AI-driven edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity that are enabling new capabilities, applications and markets at the Intelligent Edge are secular drivers.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing its output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has allowed it to lower lead times. However, it still has a significant backlog, which would translate into a year’s revenue at the current level.Shipments are expected to increase through the year, bringing the backlog back to normal levels. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 13%, making it the fifth consecutive double-digit increase, and the 19th straight year of dividend increase.The company beat January quarter estimates by 6.2% and in the last 30 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company dropped a couple of cents The 2024 estimate increased by 90 cents (9.0%).The shares are up 25.3% over the past year.Price and Consensus: ADIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip Technology Inc. (MCHP): Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where supply constraints are only now beginning to ease up.Management is currently focused on bringing down its backlog while maintaining the quality of new orders. As supply continues to improve and lead times come down, profitability will also improve. However, China’s imposing and then suddenly raising its lockdown has resulted in inventory gluts that are an overhang on Microchip’s business.Investors would be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 41.5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 7 cents (1.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate increased 35 cents (6.0%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchip’s shares are up 19.3% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHPZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSilicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB): Silicon Laboratories is a fabless semiconductor company offering wireless microcontrollers and sensor products primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan. Its products are used in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including connected home and security, industrial automation and control, smart metering, smart lighting, commercial building automation, consumer electronics, asset tracking and medical instrumentation.Silicon Laboratories is seeing solid momentum in its business, which has allowed it to double its organic revenue in two years  and increase its design wins by 120%. Management continues to see significant opportunity and expects the design win momentum to continue, further building its leadership position in IoT, despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.Silicon Laboratories topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 35.1% in the last quarter. Its 2023 EPS estimate has jumped a dollar (25.3%) in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 49 cents (9.0%).Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 26.2% over the past year.Price and Consensus: SLABZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

249,510b072f-141a-3d12-b6a7-55c73ada9c37,RF,2023-03-15,25 Largest Banks in the US by Asset Size,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-banks-us-asset-144716948.html,1678805236,STORY,"['SIVB', 'BK', 'RF-PC', 'FHN-PE', 'CMA', 'DFS', 'ZIONP', 'FITBO', 'NTRS', 'HBAN', 'STT', 'KEY', 'CFG', 'MTB-PH']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance. So, let's now take a look at the banks which are now looking over their shoulder, starting with:25. Popular, Inc. (NASDAQ:BPOP)Total assets of the company (in billions): $67.6We kickoff our list with Popular, Inc.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Amphenol's shares before the 20th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.21 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.84 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Amphenol has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $77.6. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Amphenol has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Amphenol paying out a modest 25% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Amphenol generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 27% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Amphenol's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Amphenol's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years. Amphenol is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Amphenol has lifted its dividend by approximately 23% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Amphenol worth buying for its dividend? We love that Amphenol is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Amphenol looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Amphenol and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

As a result, under Mr. Reid's leadership, Mars' annual sales grew by more than 50% to nearly $45 billion, and its global associate workforce more than doubled from 60,000 to 140,000.""We are excited to welcome Grant to Marriott's board of directors and look forward to his contributions,"" said Mr. Marriott. ""Grant brings with him a wealth of experience, having led a family-owned company that produces some of the world's most beloved and iconic brands.

Named the American Australian Association Murdoch Center, it will serve as a meeting place for Americans and Australians to collaborate in pursuit of strong ties between their two nations.The Center, located at 600 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, formally opened on March 14 with United States Ambassador to Australia, the Hon. Caroline Kennedy and Australian Ambassador to the United States, the Hon. Arthur Sinodinos AO in attendance, along with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, and Anthony Pratt.""The Murdoch Center was made possible by a very generous grant from News Corp and Fox Corporation, and with the wonderful support of the Pratt Foundation,"" said Craig Chapman, Chair of the Association. ""Their investment in our future undergirds the values of freedom and democracy that our two great nations will always share.""For 75 years, the American Australian Association has worked to strengthen the alliance between the two countries as a conduit of culture, commerce and community, opening doors to endless possibilities.The Murdoch Center will allow the Association to showcase the intellectual and artistic abilities of more than 1,000 graduate scholars, veterans and artists who have been awarded over US$15 million in grants by the Association. ""We are very proud of our scholarship and exchange programs, which are designed to offer fair opportunities to Americans and Australians alike, becoming one of the largest Indigenous exchange programs between the United States and Australia,"" said Amb. John Berry (retired), now President of the Association.Story continues""I remember my father launching the American Australian Association 75 years ago. Australia had entered the Second World War as a member of the British Empire and ended having been saved by the United States, resulting in this new bilateral relationship becoming crucial. And what was true then is absolutely the case now, with the world facing many historic challenges, including the rise of a belligerent China. To further this understanding, the Association plays an important role in creating post-graduate scholarships for talented young Australian and American researchers, whose work has transformed and saved lives,"" said Mr. Murdoch at the opening of the Murdoch Center. ""Finally, I would just add, it means much to me to have Lachlan here today sharing in this important moment and continuing the family tradition. So, many thanks to all for what you have done for the Association and for what you surely will do for the two countries that I call home, Australia and the United States.""""Australia’s relationship with America is our most important, and it’s never been stronger or closer thanks to organizations like this,"" said Anthony Pratt, also speaking at the opening ceremony. He continued, ""the Pratt Foundation is honored to support the establishment of the new center and I’m proud to be here tonight alongside Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of this great Association.""In the spirit of the evening, Ambassador Caroline Kennedy stated, ""there is no more important relationship in the world right now than the US and Australia.""The Murdoch Center will enable the United States Studies Centre in Sydney and the Perth USAsia Centre, part of the American Australian Association family, to bring their world class research from Australia to the United States. It will also empower the Association to carry forward its mission of deepening economic engagement between the two nations through business roundtables, conferences and in other gatherings that encourage trade, investment and innovation. Much of this work will come under the auspices of the Association’s Business Council, co-chaired by Lachlan Murdoch and former Association Chair, Jennifer Nason.

253,b6f27c2f-da80-32e0-a733-8cbcb46d01b4,NWSA,2023-03-15,"Get Ready - The Best Time to Sell is April 16-22, according to Realtor.com®",PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ready-best-time-sell-april-100000564.html,1678874400,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Homeowners who list that week will experience the best combination of market conditions and could get $48,000 more for their home than the start of the yearSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- While it's nearly impossible to time the real estate market, there is one week that is most likely to get home sellers the best possible outcome, according to Realtor.com®. Nationally, homeowners who list the week of April 16-22, 2023 will hit the sweet spot in terms of the best combination of higher prices, fewer homes to compete against, faster sales time and strong buyer demand. A recent survey from Realtor.com® and HarrisX found that 60% of home sellers took up to 3 months to get their home ready to list, so for homeowners who have been making preparations, listing during that crucial April week could get $48,000 more for their home than they would have at the start of the year.The Best Time to Sell is April 16-22, according to Realtor.com®""Many home shoppers kick off their search in the early spring and they often beat the majority of home sellers to the punch,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""For this reason, sellers who list on the earlier side will get more buyer attention and therefore be more likely to sell quickly and for a higher price.""Why is April 16-22 the best time to sell?While mortgage rates are expected to remain elevated through 2023, for-sale inventory is still well below pre-pandemic levels, so sellers can still expect well-priced homes to be in high demand. Those looking to take advantage of seasonal market trends should consider getting ready to list April 16-22, which is anticipated to have the best mix of market conditions for sellers, including:Higher prices – Homes listed during this week have historically had prices 2.1% higher than the average week throughout the year, and are typically 12.1% higher than the start of the year. If 2023 follows the typical seasonal trend, the national median listing price could reach $8,400 higher than the average week, and $48,000 more than the start of the year.Strong buyer demand – The more buyers looking at a home, the better, as the home is likely to get more offers and sell quickly. Historically, this week garnered 16.4% more views per listing than the typical week, but in 2022 this week got 32.5% more views per listing than the average week, as buyer demand dropped in the latter part of the year.Fast-selling homes – Thanks to above-average demand, homes tend to sell more quickly during this week. Historically, homes actively for sale during this week sold 18.0% faster than the average week. In the fast-moving 2022 market, this week saw homes typically on the market for 32 days, 13 days faster than the year's average, and 37 days faster than was typical in 2019. The 2023 market is not expected to move as quickly as in 2022, but the best week is still expected to see faster sales than the year's typical pace.Less competition from other sellers – Typically, there would be 9.3% fewer sellers on the market during this week compared to the average week throughout the year. Last year saw significant inventory gains as buyer demand cooled, but sellers responded by pulling back on listings by the end of the year. Active inventory was 65.5% higher at the start of 2023 versus 2022, but still 43.2% lower than pre-pandemic levels. This gap means there continues to be opportunities for sellers who enter the market this spring.Story continuesTips on prepping a home for saleAccording to Realtor.com®'s survey, it took most recent sellers (80%) between 2 weeks and 6 months to prepare their home for sale, with the sweet spot being between 1-3 months (32%). For most (56%) it took more time than expected to list their home, while 23% said it was faster than expected and 22% said it took about as long as they expected. For those considering a home sale this year, it's best to start preparing now in case it takes longer than anticipated.For the best chance at a quick sale and high price, homeowners should make sure that their home looks its best, has been well cared for and is up-to-date with routine maintenance. To get ready to list, about a third of recent sellers (35%) made repairs/updates to the home, did some cleaning and decluttering (33%) and found an agent to help them (31%). In order to best market their home, owners and their agents had listing photos taken (34%); created marketing materials such as flyers (27%); created a 3D/virtual tour (20%) and staged the home (11%).Making minor repairs can go a long way during a showing. Potentially, a buyer who sees leaky faucets and closet doors that don't close might become concerned about larger potential problems with the home. The most common repairs made by survey respondents were:Minor cosmetic updates such as replacing light fixtures or faucets (16%)Carpet/floor replacement or refinishing (14%)Landscaping such as mulch, vegetation, etc. (13%)Full painting of exterior (12%)Touch-up paint (12%)Full painting of interior (12%)Replacing appliances such as kitchen or laundry (11%)Replacing the roof (9%)Replacing major systems such as HVAC, hot water (8%)Caulking (6%)Replacing grout (6%)""In today's market, it's really important to price your home well and make sure that it looks its best in order to get top dollar and find a buyer quickly,"" said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst Realtor.com®. ""There are still buyers in the market, but due to high prices and interest rates, they're being a bit more picky than they were the past several years.""Homeowners who are looking to sell their home can visit Realtor.com® to find a trusted agent in their area and check out Realtor.com®'s Complete Guide for Selling Your Home.Report MethodologyListing metrics (e.g. list prices) from 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 were measured on a weekly basis, with each week compared against a benchmark from the first full week of the year. Averaging across the years yielded the ""typical"" seasonal trend for each metric. Percentile levels for each week were calculated along each metric (prices, listings, days on market, etc.), and were then averaged together across metrics to determine a Best Time to List score for each week. Rankings for each week were based on these Best Time to List scores.Survey MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 3-10, 2023, among 2,286 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 2.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups. The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Results were weighted for age by gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

As Dennis mentioned, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 financial results, which Ed will cover in more detail later.It was a good quarter for Casa with substantial sequential growth and a return to GAAP net income and positive net adjusted EBITDA results, as Ed will cover in more detail. And I am very pleased with these results and our renewed momentum.With the 2022 now behind us, there is much work to be done to accelerate our growth and return to profitability. And we believe 2023 will be a critical year for Casa as we bring our innovative solutions to the market in a cash and capital-efficient manner. We are continuing to make tremendous progress on our transformation towards software and the cloud.Our backlog entering the year is strong. Our balance sheet deferred revenue is up, and we have a solid sales pipeline across our cable, CAD, cloud and RAN product lines with many new Tier 1 CSP late-stage sales discussions and negotiations.We are also seeing growing demand for our fixed wireless access and fiber extension deployments across multiple geographies. Furthermore, we expect to deliver shipments of our latest Apex 4G/5G enterprise small cell later this year as part of a multiyear contract with a Tier 1 CSP.With respect to our cloud-native 5G core and edge portfolio, Casa's technology powered YTL win of the Ookla Speedtest Award for Yes 5G network in Malaysia, representing a significant validation of our capabilities.Casa was also part of several recent customer announcements, including Telenor's recent 5G deployments and Orange's unveiling of Europe's first experimental end-to-end 5G assay network, Pikeo.Adding to this news, our multiyear $140 million TCV partnership with Verizon that was announced in April 2022 to provide our 5G cloud-native software to power Verizon's public mobile edge computing service offering remains on track with Casa leading all the key 2022 co-deliveries and milestones called for in our contract with Verizon.Our team was delighted to spend time with our customers and showcase our technology at the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona a few weeks ago, where our innovative 5G core technology was on full display. Several of our key partners made significant announcements regarding their work with Casa, including Google's simplified cloud native network functions deployment with a native [core benefits] networking and network function optimizer. And IBM's work with Casa Enea to build a complete private 5G solution that's more scalable, dynamically adjustable, reliable and secure.I'd also like to highlight Intel's vBNG 1 terabit per second throughput success, which was also announced at Mobile World Congress. This remarkable achievement demonstrate Casa's ability to deliver 1 terabit per second on one server, resulting in better performance that requires less power and less space. With this technology providers will be able to offer services at edge that meet their performance standards and to more cost effectively expand into markets with a new Fiber-to-the-Home services.Adding to our momentum, our technology was featured in several demonstrations from our key partners, including AWS with [Totogi's] monetizable NPN Solution. Orange's Pikeo 5G core that I mentioned earlier, and continued work on NPN Solutions. This was an incredible showing for Casa, and we're honored to work with such important partners around the world to drive the next level of innovation.Finally, we also announced today that Scott Bruckner, Casa's former Chief Financial Officer, will be joining the Board of Directors to help guide the company through its next chapter. Scott has made important contributions to Casa in the past as the former CFO, and he brings a deep understanding of the company's business strategy and major customers. We look forward to the experience and expertise that Scott will bring to the Board.With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Casa's Chief Financial Officer, Ed Durkin, for his comments on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year and our 2023 outlook. Ed?Edward M. DurkinYes. Thank you, Jerry, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, we shared our preliminary revenue results publicly in late January, and we're very pleased that we've modestly exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance based on a strong quarter for cable revenues and the continued improvement in the supply chain and demand for our fixed wireless and fiber extension products.And the headlines for the quarter that our fourth quarter revenues came in at $84.4 million. We had positive GAAP net income of $1.2 million for the quarter, and we had positive net adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million during Q4.Before I cover our Q4 financial results and our December 22 successful resolution of a customer warranty dispute and provide an update on the status of our Term Loan B efforts in more detail, I first wanted to address the challenges we faced over the past few quarters and addressed 2023 high-level guidance.And as most of you know, we suspended our full year guidance early in 2022 as there were too many uncertainties around supply chain and business dynamics in general. I am pleased to say that in our press release today, we reinstated full year guidance for 2023, and it calls for top line growth and a return to positive net adjusted EBITDA results.We've set our annual 2023 revenue guidance at a range of $300 million to $325 million and positive net adjusted EBITDA for the full year. We do believe revenue for the year will be somewhat back-end weighted to the -- due to several factors, including the timing of our backlog shipments, supply chain consideration, anticipated timing of closing of deals in our sales pipeline, revenue recognition related to deferred revenue on the balance sheet as well as the shipment of our 4G/5G enterprise small cell radios in the second half of 2023 pursuant to close supply contracts we now have.As also mentioned in our earnings release, we have recently been made aware of the decision by a major North American cable customer that they will not be proceeding with Casa in their initial rollout for the cable infrastructure upgrade project. Although we will continue to receive maintenance revenue associated with that customer for 2023, we assume no future product revenues from their cable broadband infrastructure upgrade project in our 2023 guidance, which I just covered.And although we were surprised and disappointed by this news, this was not attributable to any cost cable product issues. As disclosed in our January 31 release, we have several successful virtual CCAP RPD solutions in production deployments today. And during Q4, we were also awarded a large virtual CCAP deal with a major European cable MSO with initial delivery expected later in 2023. And we are focused on providing -- continuing to provide best-in-class solutions to cable MSOs globally, just like we've done for the past 20 years.So with those preferences and comments, let's now turn to our fourth quarter financial performance in more detail. And given the depth of discussions we provided on prior calls in 2022 regarding the 2021 end-of-life decision for one access device product by 1 North American CSP tied to an E91 regulatory change, not a Casa product issue, which was the major reason for the revenue decline in 2022 versus 2021, I'll primarily be comparing our Q4 2022 results to those of Q3 2022.So getting into the quarter, and as noted earlier, revenue came in at $84.4 million, which is above the high end of our preliminary range of 83% to 84% that we provided on January 31. We also achieved positive quarterly GAAP net income and net adjusted EBITDA results of $5.2 million.Breaking down revenues across product lines, Q4 wireless revenue was $24.3 million, which was up approximately 14% from 21.4% in Q3. Q4 cable revenues were $43.9 million, up 45% from $30.2 million in Q3 due to strong end of year expansion purchases from our existing customer base in Europe and APAC. And Q4 telco revenue, which includes our vBNG router and fixed wireless access products was $16.2 million, up 6% from $15.3 million in Q3.Finally, we entered 2023 with approximately $153 million in backlog product and service orders, including 2023 scheduled Verizon 5G MEC contract billings, bringing our total backlog on balance sheet deferred revenue and the remaining $96 million of future billings under the Verizon contract in 2024 and beyond to approximately $286 million.Further, we have approximately $55 million of closed contracted business for our 4G/5G enterprise small cell radios with a major North American mobile network operator, where we get POs on an annual as ordered basis, which is not included in the backlog and deferred revenue numbers I just mentioned.And finally, and as Jerry mentioned, our Verizon partnership continues to progress very well. We've achieved all milestones in the fourth quarter that were required to achieve and this important partnership goes very, very well.Given the improvements we're seeing in the supply chain, we believe a significant majority of our backlog entering 2023 will ship in 2023, assuming there's no unanticipated deterioration in supply chain commitments in the future.Moving to gross profit. GAAP gross profit in the quarter came in at $36 million or 42.6% of revenue. This includes an additional inventory obsolescence charge of $10.4 million in the quarter related to older cable inventory and some access device inventory with these Q4 additional reserves based on a prudent consideration of all factors related to inventory at year-end. And excluding the Q4 inventory obsolescence charges, gross profit would have been approximately $46.4 million or 55% of revenue.Turning now to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $37.9 million, down 15% from the prior quarter. The savings are related to various year-end adjustments, including adjustments to our cost structure implemented during 2022 and reductions in the company's variable compensation program given 2022 annual performance, net of some other Q4 charges, which impacted operating expense.Our GAAP operating loss for the quarter is $1.9 million. This is obviously influenced and impacted by the $10.4 million inventory obsolescence charges in the quarter.Finally, related to our Q4 P&amp;L, our net income for the quarter was $1.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share versus a net loss of $31.2 million in Q3 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $5.3 million in net income or $0.05 per share and reported net adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million, all as reflected in the schedules to the press release.Switching now to the customer warranty settlement matter. As you may recall from Q3, our net loss for Q3 increased due to a $12.8 million charge related to a warranty matter, related to a failed replacement units for one of our products. This failure was attributed to an unauthorized part substitution by a supplier.We're very happy to announce that this customer dispute has been amicably resolved and settled with the customer in December 2022 with no material changes to the warranty settlement charge of $12.8 million recorded in Q3. We made our first cash payment under the settlement just prior to year-end and the remaining $9.5 million due will be paid in equal installments over the next 3 years.Given the initial potential exposure was approximately $56 million, as disclosed in our Q2 2022 10-Q, we're very pleased with this final amical outcome with this important customer. And related to this, we also implemented new QA control procedures with the supplier and will be receiving increased future product discounts from the supplier based on the settlement we consummated with the supplier in March 2023, which will further improve the net economics to Casa for this now resolved matter.Turning briefly to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and a small amount of restricted cash of $129.4 million. I would also like to note that none cash is held on deposit with SVB, Signature Bank or any of the smaller regional banks as we've used the Bank of America as our primary bank for years.Our cash balance at December 31 was down $67 million compared to September 30, but this was primarily due to a $50 million reduction in our Term Loan B debt, which we retired in Q4 at a discount, given rise to a $2.8 million gain on debt extinguishment in the quarter. And this cash level also included the cash payment under the warranty matter I just mentioned and operating cash burn for the quarter, given we had relatively low levels of receivables entering Q4 of approximately $49 million, which is not the case as we finished 2022.And we ended 2022 on the receivable side with strong accounts receivable balance of approximately $75 million, which is up more than 50% from the prior quarter and which bodes well for Q1 cash flow as we enter 2023.Looking down the balance sheet, you'll see our Term Loan B debt, which is due in December of 2023 has moved from long term on our balance sheet to cover it as we had yet to complete an extension of this maturity at year-end. And turning to this topic Term Loan B, I'm very pleased to say we have engaged J.P. Morgan as our banker, and we are actively working with the talented JPM team to explore options to address and extend the Term Loan B well before the late December 2023 maturity date.I also want to acknowledge that given this current maturity is about 9 months away, it does bring into question going concern considerations. But again, we're working hard on this with J.P. Morgan and plan to quickly address it well before Q4 2023.And as also mentioned in the press release, we are prioritizing return to growth and profitability in 2023 and beyond, and we are actively reviewing our cost structure, like any well-run company focused on profitability and cash and capital efficient operating results to ensure that we meet or exceed our 2023 financial goals and complete the transformation that Jerry has started over the past many quarters.So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jerry for some closing remarks before questions. Jerry?Jerry GuoThank you, Ed. As you read in our earnings release today, I announced my retirement as Casa Systems' Chairman, President and the CEO, effective March 17.I'm very excited about the future of Casa, but I've been working for over 2 decades and now it is a good time to make a transition and for me to step away from my daily operational role. I will be involved as a Board member and a major shareholder going forward.I would like to thank my co-founders, current and past coworkers, customers and partners and all other Casa's stakeholders for truly amazing 20 years. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished over the past 2 decades.The search for my successor is underway. In the meantime, I will assist Ed Durkin, our Interim CEO and fantastic CFO to drive the transformation of Casa and achieve our 2023 goals.I would now like to turn the call back to Ed for his final thoughts.Thank you, Jerry. Before we conclude, I would like to profoundly thank Jerry for his truly tireless 20 years of dedicated service to Casa. He founded the company over 20 years ago, grew it from a small start-up to a public company with 1,000 global employees. And installed base of marquee customers, and it's truly impressive what he has been able to build. It's been an honor and pleasure working with him for the past year. I do hope we get them richly deserved downtime with Lucy, is family and beautiful granddaughters.And in my role as new interim CEO, I'm looking forward to working closely with Jerry and the Board as we execute on our 2023 business plans and deliver on renewed growth and profitability. And we also appreciate the continued support of and interest in Casa by all on this call, and we look forward to sharing additional progress on our transformation in 2023.With that quick notice sincere thanks and well wishes to my friend, Jerry, I will now turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.Simon Matthew LeopoldA couple of things I wanted to check on. The operating expenses were quite a bit lower in the fourth quarter. And I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks the adjustment of variable comp, but I just wanted to confirm whether or not there were any headcount cuts. And really what I'm getting at is how should we think about operating expenses as we go through 2023.Edward M. DurkinGood question, Simon. Look, during Q3 and Q4, we did make some modest cost reductions to the business. We also had some Q4 charges that increased operating expenses. I think the majority of the savings were driven by changes to the variable bonus program, which is an annual event based on annual performance. So that was the main driver. But we can certainly provide more guidance on this on our next call as to normalized operating expenses going forward after we get through some planning that Jerry and I and the Board are doing now.Simon Matthew LeopoldAnd then you sort of gave us a lot of qualitative comments around some of the business trends. And it sounds to me you're most constructive on the wireless business still. And looking for some sense of how you envision the business mix within that full year revenue forecast, what's sort of strongest and what's maybe the weakest part of the business? I'm guessing cable's the weakest and wireless is the strongest, but just want to get a better understanding of how you see it?Edward M. DurkinYes. So another good question, Simon. Thank you. The business has really good fundamentals across all of our product lines to include cable CAD, cloud and RAN with each contributing to top line results into 2023. Cloud, which includes our 5G core and mobile edge computing software, our vBNG routing software and our security gateway software we'll have the fastest growth rate over 2022 as compared to the others. But cable, CAD and 4G/5G small cell radios also will deliver in 2023 as well. But cloud will be the fastest-growing segment.Simon Matthew LeopoldAnd then in regards to the cable customer you called out, is this a customer that had in the past reach significance of being a 10% reportable customer? Just trying to get a sense of the significance of that comment regarding the North American cable customer?Edward M. DurkinYes. This was a significant cable customer from the past. And we received news or not being deployed in their initial rollout in 2023, but we will continue to work this major account, and we'll see what transpires. We did get a virtual CCAP award from a major European MSO because one of our competitors failed to deliver. So we'll see what happens. But this was a larger cable -- North American cable customer, to your question.Simon Matthew LeopoldAnd just to clarify, the fourth quarter strength in cable, was that in any way related to this customer? I know you mentioned Europe and Asia Pacific contributing to cable. But I also know often when a customer is winding down a relationship, they may do sort of last time buys. Wondering if that contributed to that strength of cable in the fourth quarter?Edward M. DurkinThat did not contribute, Simon, to the strength in Q4. This was balance strong growth across all the geos and this North American customer and had nothing to do with those strong results.OperatorThe next question is coming from Tim Savageaux from Northland Capital Markets.Timothy Paul SavageauxFollowing on the cable discussion. I mean it looks like I have chartered at 13% of revenues year-to-date. I mean, assuming they're somewhere in the mid-teens for the year. Given your guidance for next year, do you expect the cable segment to be able to grow based on other or run rate business? Or are you making any particular assumption about declines of that major North American customer that maybe will restrain growth in cable? I have a couple of follow-ups.Edward M. DurkinYes. So again we have a global installed base of top cable MSOs. All of them are satisfied customers with high CSAT. As it relates to this North American customer we mentioned, we are contracted for a set amount of annual maintenance support revenue, which is in our plan. It's contracted and guaranteed. We did not include any product revenues from this major North American customer in our 2023 plan.So to the extent we have success there later in the year, that would be upside. I think our cable business in 2023 versus 2022 can grow modestly on the strength of the many other cable MSO customers we have globally as well as our new and expanded virtual CCAP RPD cable next-gen product offering. So I think cable will be a modest growth line of business for us with no dependency on this major North American customer.Timothy Paul SavageauxAnd I just missed the backlog. I wonder if you might mind repeating that exiting the year, deferred revenue numbers?Edward M. DurkinSure things. So we entered 2023 with $153 million in backlog product and service orders, including the contracted 2023 billings under the Verizon 5G mobile edge computing contract. And that brings our total backlog, deferred revenue and the remaining $96 million of future billings under the Verizon MEC contract for 2024 and beyond to roughly $286 million.In addition, we have approximately $55 million of closed contracted business for our 4G/5G enterprise small cell radios with a major North American network operator, which we closed in Q3. And under that new contract, we get POs on an annual as ordered basis so -- and as such, we don't include it in the backlog and deferred revenue numbers I just mentioned, so that is incremental.So entering 2023, I think the punchline is we're much better shape as compared to 2022 relative to backlog that can ship in supply chain and contracted deals with major Tier 1 CSPs and we're going to continue to focus on that and again, drive renewed growth and net adjusted EBITDA positive results into 2023.Timothy Paul SavageauxAnd back on the cable side. I mean I assume what you're referring to in terms of the possible second half expectations is kind of the next-gen kind of virtualized Remote PHY oriented aspect of that operator's upgrade plan. Just wondering if you can confirm that? And I know this is a tough one to answer, but I'll ask it anyway. I mean, is there -- had that come through as expected? What would your guidance look like for this year?Edward M. DurkinSo we originally had anticipated second half core and RPD Remote PHY business from this. We were surprised when we learned they had decided to go in a different direction. Obviously, our guidance would have been meaningfully higher. We are not giving up on the customer or the customer relationship, but that's the status of it as we stand today, and we want to be transparent and transparent on the matter. Jerry, I don't know if you have any other -- anything else you would add, but I think that's where we stand today.Jerry GuoYes, Ed you covered it well. We did have a much higher guidance in our original plan. We revised it to basically reflect a conservative approach at this point.Timothy Paul SavageauxAnd last question for me. Pretty impressive gross margin performance even with the charge. But I assume that's heavily influenced by the cable strength and capacity licenses and whatnot in terms of driving that. And so, and that would be a high point for the year. Given your comments on cable, I mean, do you continue to expect sort of an upward direction in gross margins as we head into '23, given you've been in a pretty wide range in '22?Edward M. DurkinSo Tim, I think...Jerry GuoYes. Tim, when you look...Edward M. DurkinI'm sorry, go ahead, Jerry.Jerry GuoSorry. So, Tim, when you look at the growth drivers for Casa in 2023, the wireless core, the Packet Core is one of the significant growth drivers and that's pure software. And of course, it's going to help with the margin. And we also have a small cell radio as another growth driver in 2023. It's a mid-margin business. And our cable is going to be a combination of virtual CCAP core and chassis and license sales as well as RPD sales. And they tend to come in at a very good margin, historically, very good, and we don't see a significant difference in the gross margin of cable this year.Operator(Operator Instructions) We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.Jerry GuoWell, again, I'd like to thank everybody for attending this call, and we look forward to reporting to you the transformation of the company and the management team under Ed, the performance, the management under Ed going forward.OperatorThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.]"

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. CHRW is benefiting from improved freight market conditions and shareholder-friendly initiatives. Notably, shares of C.H. Robinson have gained 6.9% over the past three months against the 0.9% loss of the industryit belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHow is C.H. Robinson Placed?We are impressed with C.H. Robinson’s efforts to boost its shareholder value via dividend payouts and shares repurchases are commendable. During 2021, the company returned approximately $886 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends ($277 million) and share buybacks ($609 million).Continuing the shareholder-friendly approach, C.H. Robinson rewarded its shareholders in 2022 through a combination of cash dividends ($285.32 million) and share repurchases ($1,488.28 million). Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.With improved freight market conditions, C.H. Robinson is benefiting from higher pricing and volumes across most of its service lines. In 2022, the top line improved 6.9% owing to higher pricing in truckload, less-than-truckload and ocean services. Solid segmental growth was also witnessed in 2022.In the North American Surface Transportation segment, total revenues were $15.82 billion (up 9.1% year over year) in 2022. Total revenues at Global Forwarding in 2022 were $6.81 billion, up 1.2% year over year.On the flip side, an increase in operating expenses poses a threat to C.H. Robinson’s bottom line. In 2022, total operating costs increased 6.4% year over year. Costs are also likely to be high going forward.C.H. Robinson’s liquidity position is weak. CHRW exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $217.48 million compared with the long-term debt of $920.04 million. This implies that the company does not have sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA, Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK and American Airlines AAL.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.68%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.06%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.7%.Coming into today, shares of the engine maker had lost 5.06% in the past month. In that same time, the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector lost 8.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.68%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cummins as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Cummins to post earnings of $4.70 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 16.34%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8 billion, up 25.27% from the year-ago period.CMI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $18.95 per share and revenue of $32.06 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +25.33% and +14.19%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.5% lower. Cummins is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Cummins has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.47 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.54, which means Cummins is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesInvestors should also note that CMI has a PEG ratio of 1.37 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.37 as of yesterday's close.The Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103, which puts it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The move came after it missed a $140 million interest payment last month.Diamond owns 19 networks under the Bally Sports banner. Those networks have the rights to 42 professional teams — 14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL.The company said in a release Tuesday night that it expects to continue to operate during the bankruptcy process and that coverage of games should not be affected.Diamond Sports also said it is negotiating a restructuring agreement with debt holders that will eliminate most of its debt. Under an agreement with creditors, it would become a separate company from Sinclair Broadcast Group.“DSG will continue broadcasting games and connecting fans across the country with the sports and teams they love,"" Diamond Sports CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. ""We look forward to working constructively with our team and league partners and all DSG stakeholders throughout this process and beyond.”Diamond said in a financial filing last fall it had debt of $8.67 billion. The bankruptcy filing was made in the Southern District of Texas.Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019.

There was always a political subtext to shareholder Kenneth Simeone’s lawsuit demanding access to Walt Disney Co documents detailing how its board members decided the company should speak up against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act.The law, after all, is better known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis explicitly cited Disney’s “woke” criticism when he urged Florida lawmakers to revoke the company’s control over Disney World’s special real estate district after Disney spoke out against the law.But as a trial looms on Wednesday in Delaware Chancery Court, the social issue subtext has completely subsumed the nominal purpose of the books-and-records lawsuit. Books-and-records cases are usually dry affairs. Not this one.Disney alleges that the shareholder suit is actually being orchestrated by the Thomas More Society, a non-profit law firm whose website celebrates its work for abortion and COVID vaccine opponents. Lawyers with ties to Thomas More, Disney said, went looking for a Disney shareholder to sue the company. When they found him, Disney asserts, Thomas More agreed to advance the costs of the litigation, including fees for Simeone counsel Paul Jonna of LiMandri &amp; Jonna, who is also special counsel to the group.This purported books-and-records case, according to Disney, isn’t really about a shareholder’s right to examine internal corporate documents beyond the redacted board minutes Disney has already produced. It’s an excuse, argued Disney counsel from Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and Richards, Layton &amp; Finger, for lawyers with a social and political agenda to fish for culture- war ammunition.“The issues still at play here are driven not by a stockholder or by stockholder interests, but instead by the lawyers chosen and paid for by the Thomas More Society to further some cause — whether social, political or both — that is wholly divorced from the interests of the Disney stockholder,” Disney said.Story continuesSimeone’s lawyers, meanwhile, contend that Disney’s fixation on their ties to Thomas More and other Catholic groups has suffused the case with “anti-Catholic bigotry.”“Never in all their years of experience as litigators have plaintiff’s counsel encountered the appalling spectacle of their Catholic religion being made an issue in a case,” wrote Jonna and Delaware counsel Sean Bellew of Bellew law firm.Jonna and Bellew insisted in Simeone’s final pre-trial brief that their client, a longtime Disney investor, is exercising his legitimate rights as a shareholder to investigate a management decision that harmed the company. They made Disney’s allegedly “anti-Catholic” litigation tactics part of their argument: By focusing on the lawyers’ affiliation with religious freedom groups, they asserted, Disney leaders had once again placed their own “social and political aims” above shareholders’ interests. Such tactics, the shareholder lawyers said, are an “enormous detriment” to the company.Like I said, not exactly your typical Chancery Court books-and-records dispute.Disney counsel from Cravath and Richards Layton did not respond to my query about the case, including a question about the other side’s assertions of anti-Catholic bias. Shareholder counsel Bellew declined to comment. Simeone is seeking to compel Disney to turn over, among other things, questionnaires about board members’ independence, internal correspondence about the Florida education bill and information about Disney’s policies on charitable and political donations.Wednesday’s trial before Vice Chancellor Lori Will will feature only oral arguments by counsel for both sides, not testimony from live witnesses.Disney and shareholder lawyers did agree, according to a joint pre-trial stipulation,that the deposition of Disney shareholder Simeone would be part of the case record.In that deposition, Simeone described how he came to bring the books-and-records demand. Simeone said he invested in Disney shares decades ago because he was a huge fan of the company and was confident that its shares would help fund his retirement. (He even moved in retirement to Kissimmee, Florida, to be close to Disney World.) Simeone said he was angry when Disney took what he considered to be an unnecessary public stand against Florida’s law and wanted a public accounting of how the company reached the “political decision” to speak out.But Simeone did not contemplate litigation, he said, until he was approached by a distant family member who knew that Simeone was a Disney shareholder. The family member, a lawyer, put Simeone in touch with Jonna, the Thomas More special counsel.Disney has said that Simeone’s testimony shows that the shareholder’s suit was motivated by these lawyers, who are part of what Disney called “overlapping networks” promoting conservative, religious values.During the Feb. 10 deposition, Simeone counsel Bellew blocked Disney questions about how Simeone’s lawyers are being paid. But in a Feb. 28 interrogatory response Disney cited in its last pre-trial brief, Simeone disclosed that Thomas More is paying Jonna’s legal fees, albeit at a discounted rate. (Delaware counsel Bellew is not receiving fees from Thomas More.) Thomas More will be paid back if the Delaware court ends up awarding fees to Simeone’s lawyers.Disney has said in its briefs that it respects the rights of Simeone’s lawyers “to hold and pursue their own religious, political and cultural views” and has only highlighted their affiliations to show that Thomas More and the lawyers are driving the case.But I’m sure the company is not looking forward being accused in courtroom arguments on Wednesday of smearing Catholic lawyers in the defense of a corporate values that advances progressive values at the expense of shareholder interests.The culture wars, in other words, are coming to Chancery.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Oneok Inc. (OKE) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this natural gas company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 41.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Oneok is 10.6%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Oneok. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 11.9% over the past month.Bottom LineOneok has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Oneok is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 largest banks in the U.S. by asset size.The collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) has sent shockwaves not just through the U.S. banking industry but has had global implications as well. For well over a decade now, banks have been considered infallible, especially the largest banks in the U.S. by asset size. Often deemed too big to fail, questionable bank practices have been continuing with largest risks taken by such banks with no fallout till now.So how exactly did SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fall? The largest bank collapse since the 2008 Financial Crisis has come about as the perfect storm of a higher risk appetite of the bank, the economic conditions in the U.S. and the world, and stunning incompetence by the senior management of the bank. Several years ago, when near-zero interest rates abounded, SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), like many other financial groups, invested billions of dollars into long-term bonds which is considered to be a safe bet. What SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) didn't do was engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its risk, which came back to haunt the company. When inflation reached record levels, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to control inflation, and when interest rates are increased, bond prices start to fall. Hence, when interest rates continued to be increased consistently throughout 2022, and continuing through 2023, the bond portfolio of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) fell. This is also true for several of the other largest banks in the U.S. by assets as at the end of 2022, U.S. banks were sitting on unrealized losses worth $620 billion.25 largest banks in the U.S. by asset sizePhoto by Bank Phrom on UnsplashAnother issue for tech companies, especially startups, which made up a large percentage of the bank's clients, faced higher borrowing costs because of which more cash had to be used towards the repayment of debt, while also being unable to raise funding from venture capitalists because of economic uncertainty. Then came the move that company insiders have called ""absolutely idiotic"", when the bank's CEO stated in public the financial issues that the bank was facing even before lining up the requisite capital, thus resulting in a bank run that caused the second-biggest U.S. banking failure on record. One insider said “People are just shocked at how stupid the CEO is. You’re in business for 40 years and you are telling me you can’t raise $2 billion privately? Get on a jet and fly to Kuwait like everyone else and give them control of one-third of the bank.”Story continuesEven Jeff Sonnenfeld, CEO of the Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI) said that considering SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) had capital which was far in excess of regulatory requirements, and didn't need to disclose its unsubscribed $2.25 billion capital raise. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the government would not be bailing out the bank, which means that even though deposits have been protected by the government to maintain public confidence, creditors and shareholders will definitely not be compensated for their huge losses.Considering how recent this event is, the fallout from this failure resulted in the market value of banks plummeting in less than a week, with banks such as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), First Horizon Corporation (FHN), PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) seeing their share price fall between 23% to 66% on March 13th, with trading halted in some cases because of share prices plummeting. The ramifications have spread across the ocean to Europe as well, with European banks seeing their worst day in a year on March 13th. This is despite HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) announcing the purchase of Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 which has been positive news for tech companies in the country.The crisis will continue to impact some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets, and smaller ones as well, with Signature Bank being closed by the state of New York on March 12, 2023, after customers withdrew over $10 billion in deposits. President Joe Biden has had to come out and attempt to rally confidence amid fears that this could lead to a massive banking failure, the likes of which haven't been seen since the Great Recession. While overall stocks teetered as a result of these events, the Nasdaq Composite climbed yesterday, with confidence being restored mainly after the Biden administration stated that it would backfill customer deposits at both collapsed banks.Whether there are any long-term impacts for some of the largest banks in the U.S. by assets remains to be seen, though these banks will definitely be more cautious in their dealings. To determine our list, we obtained all banks that appear in the Fortune 500 list, and checked their latest total assets from Yahoo Finance. So, let's now take a look at the banks which are now looking over their shoulder, starting with:25. Popular, Inc.

The company is offering new suites of products, such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others. With the growing use of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up. This has resulted in higher demand for advanced networking architecture, leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches.

289,faa03bb6-5c4b-3405-8e70-b1a3879ec574,DVN,2023-03-15,11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-crude-oil-stocks-022751975.html,1678847271,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'FANG', 'HAL', 'PXD', 'CVX', 'DVN', 'MPC', 'XOM', 'OXY']","[In this article, we discuss the 11 best crude oil stocks to buy as tensions rise. To skip the detailed analysis of the crude oil market, go directly to the 5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy.Crude oil is one of the most primed industries in the world. However, it is also quite volatile which has been quite evident in recent years. According to Maximize Market Research, the industry’s market size reached $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by 2029. The global oil reserves volume is at around 1.65 trillion barrels while 99.8 million barrels were consumed daily on average in 2022, up from 94.1 million barrels a day in 2021.Latest Updates on the Crude Oil MarketCrude oil prices went flying shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine to around $119 per barrel on March 6 due to sanctions on Russian fossil fuel imports by the USA and part of Europe. However, the prices have dropped down to the pre-war levels with crude oil trading at around $74 per barrel WTI.The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) February 2023 report predicts that the global oil supply could reach higher than the demand in the first half of 2023. However, we reported previously that for the full year 2023, the global oil demand is expected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to just shy of 102 million barrels per day. The biggest factor in this rise in demand is set to come from China as its travel restrictions ease and borders open up. Furthermore, the seasonal demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in Europe recently rose in winter. However, the US and OPEC warned that they are unable to increase the output which is expected to leave Europe in hot waters as Russia previously cut off some important pipeline flows of natural gas in retribution for imposing energy sanctions backed by the USA.Additionally, the recent collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank disturbed the equities market which also slightly affected the oil prices as they fell by around 2% on March 13. However, this seems temporary and is expected to be offset by the recovery in demand by China.Story continuesCrude Oil Market in the FutureIn one of our articles, we highlighted that the global oil demand will reach its peak between 2023 and 2025. Nevertheless, due to climate risks, the world is making a shift toward renewable energy sources which will offset the demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in the future. The demand for coal-based energy is slowly declining and it is only a matter of time before the fossil fuel demand drop starts affecting crude oil.Nevertheless, crude oil is a much more important source of energy than coal, so the prices are expected to keep rising till the global crude oil reserves are exhausted in around 47 years. Even though renewable energy sources are taking over, the need for petrochemicals and long-distance travel will still keep the global oil demand stable. The IEA believes that by 2040, the demand will increase to 104.1 million barrels of oil per day from approximately 98 million in 2019. Furthermore, crude oil prices are also expected to increase because as time passes, cheap oil sources are set to decline gradually.In the current market, crude oil stocks might be volatile but several of them have remained to be some of the most profitable companies in the world and have decent shareholder returns. Some of the crude oil stocks that investors need to look out for are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions RisePhoto by Zbynek Burival on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe analyzed the global crude oil market and chose the best stocks to buy, keeping their hedge fund sentiment as the most important metric and taking the analyst ratings around each stock into consideration. Most of the companies on the list have strong balance sheets and have maintained good profitability over the years.  Moreover, their capital returns have also remained healthy.We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds. Note that we skipped the companies whose crude oil production covered less than 10% of their business portfolio.11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise11. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the world’s largest oilfield services and equipment companies. It is an American company with headquarters in Texas, USA, and Dubai, UAE. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the best crude oil stocks and one of Jim Cramer’s top picks for 2023.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a significantly fairly valued company with a PE ratio of 19.9x at the time of writing, compared to its peer average of 21.2x. Moreover, it is also trading below the US Energy Services industry which has a PE ratio of 23x.On January 30, HSBC analyst Abhishek Kumar reiterated a Buy rating on Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) and raised his price target to $57 from $43.90.

The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”10.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -21.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 13.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share, indicating a change of -16.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -15.3%. This estimate has changed -10.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.17 indicates a change of +1.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.22 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $17.82 billion and $17.49 billion estimates indicate -7% and -1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even then, the Chinese government would have to agree to such a transaction, the people said.TikTok’s US business could be valued at $40 billion to $50 billion based on social media multiples and other factors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz.TikTok is under scrutiny for its Chinese ownership, which US officials are concerned could lead to manipulation or spying by China on Americans — a fear TikTok is working to address. The company, which is undergoing a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, agreed last year to implement a number of changes in a plan it calls Project Texas. The proposal includes bringing in American tech giant Oracle Corp. to host US user data and review its software, and appointing a three-person government-approved oversight board. Many of the moves are already under way.But Cfius, which is a panel of multiple agencies involved in national security, has stalled in its review process, leaving TikTok unsure of whether its plans will be sufficient to continue operating in the US, the people said. Members of the committee from the Justice Department have been unwilling to accept TikTok’s proposal, according to other people familiar with the matter.Story continues“Neither a ban of TikTok nor a divestiture of TikTok from ByteDance does anything to address national security concerns about data transfers,” said Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok. “Under Project Texas, TikTok data for our US users would be held to a significantly higher security standard than any comparable American company.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“Listing TikTok’s US business could fetch a $40-$50 billion valuation, using current social-media multiples and TikTok’s higher top-line growth vs. Meta, Snap and Pinterest, we calculate after Bloomberg News reported TikTok’s leadership was discussing possible separation from ByteDance. We don’t think a large tech firm might be interested in buying TikTok, but Microsoft’s focus on Bing and ChatGPT could drive interest in adding a video platform like TikTok to compete with Alphabet’s YouTube, especially if the Microsoft-Activision deal fails.”— Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz, analystsClick here for researchTikTok is also facing a barrage of potential legislation in Congress, some of which mandates a separation. Lawmakers, concerned that the app may be forced to share data with the Chinese government or could be used as an influence tool by China, have proposed multiple bills with bipartisan support that call for banning the video-sharing app or selling it.TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew has been asked to testify before a House committee next week about the app’s data privacy and security practices, and the company’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.The Canadian civil service, the European Commission and the US Congress have also banned staff from using the app because of concerns about how the company collects data. The UK is also weighing banning it from government devices, a person familiar with the matter said. Last month, four privacy regulators in Canada also launched an investigation into TikTok over its collection, use and disclosure of personal information.ByteDance was valued at about $220 billion in a recent private-market investment by Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, Bloomberg News reported separately. That’s a significant discount to the $300 billion that TikTok’s owner set during a share buyback program last year.G42, controlled by United Arab Emirates royal Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, acquired a $100 million-plus stake from existing investors in recent months through its 42XFund, people with knowledge of the deal said. Another fund bought into ByteDance at a $225 billion shortly after, one of the people said, asking not to be identified describing non-public information.(Updates with TikTok bans internationally in ninth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon WorldBrazil’s Surprise Oil Tax Puts $20 Billion in Investment at RiskNaples, Florida, Is Getting So Expensive That City Workers Can't Afford ItDrugs in Orbit: One Startup’s Big Idea for Microgravity©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with its presence in all the major metropolitan markets of the country.Particularly, PSA has its market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers that have high population levels. As such, apart from benefiting from brand recognition, the company is likely to gain from economies of scale.Last month, PSA reported fourth-quarter 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $4.16, increasing 17.5% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99. Results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth, aided by an improvement in the realized annual rent per occupied square foot and expansion efforts.Public Storage’s accretive buyouts to maximize its growth opportunities seem encouraging.  In 2022, the company acquired 74 self-storage facilities comprising 4.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $730.5 million. From the beginning of 2020 through Dec 31, 2022, the company acquired 368 facilities, with 31.7 million net rentable square feet, for $6.6 billion.Following Dec 31, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy eight self-storage facilities spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space across five states for $70.5 million.On the balance-sheet front, PSA holds one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with ample liquidity. Its investment-grade credit ratings render its favorable access to the debt market. With solid balance-sheet strength, it is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Public Storage’s current cash flow growth is projected at 96.4% compared with 11.88% growth predicted for the industry. Moreover, this real estate investment trust’s (REIT’s) trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential.Public Storage’s ROE is 72.77% compared with the industry’s average of 3.77%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. With solid balance-sheet strength, the company is well-poised to capitalize on external growth opportunities, which are likely to increase.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has been revised upward over the past month. Also, shares of Public Storage have gained 3.3% in the quarter-to-date period against its industry’s decline of 2.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States with intense competition from several private, regional and local operators. This is likely to fuel competition for the company, affecting occupancies, curbing its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Moreover, with the abating of the pandemic’s impact, tenants are reverting to more normal move-out behavior, resulting in upward pressure on vacate trends.Also, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

The company's shares maintained its current share price over the past couple of month on the NYSE, with a relatively tight range of US$125 to US$133. However, does this price actually reflect the true value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Yum! Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What Is Yum! Brands Worth?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Yum! Brands’s ratio of 26.4x is above its peer average of 19.45x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Hospitality industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that Yum! Brands’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Yum! Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 32% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Yum! Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell?

But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on YUM for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks provide several advantages to income investors, including regular income, the potential for growth, and long-term returns. The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some well-known dividend stocks that have rewarded shareholders with consistent dividend growth and have sound financials.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”14.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $5.4 billion.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

(NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 1.11%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is next on our list of the best dividend-paying stocks to buy now.

The company remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning approximately $1 billion to investors in dividends in FY22.Andvari Associated mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”6.

Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Tripadvisor's Earnings Growth And 2.3% ROEIt is hard to argue that Tripadvisor's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.5%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 33% seen by Tripadvisor over the last five years is not surprising. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Tripadvisor's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 16% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Tripadvisor's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Tripadvisor Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Tripadvisor doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Tripadvisor. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published the latest findings of its annual Retirement Savings and Spending study, which found women lag far behind men in terms of retirement contributions, savings, and confidence. Notably, the median 401(k) account balance for women was 65% lower compared to men. The study surveys a national representative group of 401(k) participants, with this iteration focused on the gender gap in retirement savings, addressing plan access and adequacy, a key theme in T. Rowe Price's 2023 U.S. Retirement Market Outlook.Although women are saving less, there were no meaningful gaps inaccess to retirement plans between men and women. According to 2022 Census data, retirement plan participation appears consistent among private sector wage and salaried workers between the ages of 21 and 64 across both genders (52.5% participation for men versus 51% participation for women).Some contributing factors to the gender savings gap likely include:National income averages reflect that women typically earn less than menWomen are more likely to have shorter job tenures compared to men (median of six verses eight years)More women than men held debt across most of the categories offered in the survey, to include credit card and personal loan debt, with a staggering disparity in student load debt in particular. According to the study, 23% of women and 14% of men reported student loan debt - a difference of 60%""The gender income gap is contributing to a domino effect of women's finances; lower earnings can have an effect on their current financial decisions which ultimately impacts their financial future, including retirement savings,"" said Judith Ward, CFP®, thought leadership director. ""As women, it's critical for us to be proactive when it comes to our money and to seek guidance and education that is necessary to put us on the path toward a successful financial future.""Story continuesAdditional key findings from the survey include:The median annual contribution for women was 43% less than menWomen are less confident about retirement than men (22% verses 37%)""The gender gap in retirement savings is a challenge for women who are preparing for retirement, and we understand that there are various social and economic factors that significantly affect women's ability to save,"" said Sudipto Banerjee, vice president, Retirement Thought Leadership at T.

To become a large-cap company, the business must prove its worth over an extended period (usually) while under constant public scrutiny of professional investors. They most often offer less volatility, and more predictable returns than their small-cap counter parts.Using one of Zacks many premium screens I was able to identify three large-cap stocks with strong near-term expectations, and reasonable valuations.https://www.zacks.com/screening/premium-screens?icid=screening-screening-nav_tracking-zcom-main_menu_wrapper-premium_screens American ExpressAmerican Express AXP is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit card products, and travel-related services worldwide. American Express offers its customers a premium service with generous customer loyalty perks, and fraud protection. The company is divided into four segments: U.S. consumer services, commercial services, international card services, and global merchant and network services.American Express has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter sales are projected to grow 19% to $14 billion, while current quarter earnings are expected to fall -2.6% to $2.66 per share. Current quarter declines are primarily due to increased marketing and business development expenses. Next quarter and current year earnings are expected to resume strong growth, with current year earnings forecasted at $11.24 per share, a 14% YoY increase.Current quarter earnings revisions have also seen mixed updates, although they are still up slightly over the last 90 days. The rest of the timeframes have seen significant revisions higher over the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last ten years AXP stock has averaged annual returns of 10%. YTD the stock is up 7%, but well off its high, when it was up 24%. This pullback offers an opportunity for discerning investors.Story continuesAmerican Express is trading at a very reasonable valuation. With a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14x it is just below its 10-year median of 15x. AXP also offers a dividend yield of 1.5%, which it has raised an average of 7.5% annually over the last five years. Where it stands currently, AXP offers a very nice mix of value and growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCisco Cisco CSCO is a digital communications technology conglomerate based in San Jose California. CSCO designs, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other technology products. The company has many industry leading products across a number of domains including Internet of Things (IoT), cyber security, videoconferencing, energy management, OpenDNS and many others.Cisco has been around since 1990 so it has seen many different economic environments. During the early 2000s technology bubble its, market cap exploded to $500 billion and was trading at a 100x earnings multiple. It has since evolved into a steady slow growth stock, and a company that produces so critical technological infrastructure.  Cisco boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts are in unanimous agreement in revising earnings higher recently.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven as an older tech company Cisco shows steady double-digit sales and earnings growth. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 12%YoY to $14.4 billion and earnings are projected to climb 12% to $0.97 per share.Cisco offers a dividend yield of 3.1% and it has raised its dividend by an average of 4.1% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCSCO is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14x, which is below is 20-year median of 15x.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Kroger Co.Kroger KR operates as an all-in-one retail outlet.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.American Express and Moody's are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AXP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.AXP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.02, while MCO has a forward P/E of 30.62. We also note that AXP has a PEG ratio of 0.97. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.78.Another notable valuation metric for AXP is its P/B ratio of 4.77. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MCO has a P/B of 19.44.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, AXP holds a Value grade of B, while MCO has a Value grade of F.AXP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MCO, so it seems like value investors will conclude that AXP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NiSource’s stable return from regulated assets and focus on clean energy are likely to boost its earnings performance.However, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has to face risks of aging infrastructure that needs regular replacement.TailwindsNiSource is working on a long-term utility infrastructure modernization program and has an estimated $15 billion in natural gas and electric infrastructure investment opportunities, which are expected to drive earnings. The company’s planned regulated investments will improve the reliability and safety of its electric and natural gas services provided to its expanding customer base. It has $2 billion of planned renewable investment through 2023.NiSource is also expected to benefit from its cost saving initiatives, which would result in decreased operation and maintenance expenses. The company had $1.6 billion net liquidity available as of Dec 31, 2022, which is adequate to meet its debt obligations. It does not have any significant long-term debt obligations until 2024.Due to the delay in solar generation projects, the company now expects to retire Schahfer Generating Station’s remaining two coal units by the end of 2025. It is also set to retire its 100% coal-generating sources between 2026 and 2028, and replace the production volumes with reliable and cleaner options at lower costs. NiSource aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% within 2030 from 2005 levels.The company’s board of directors declared a new quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share, making NiSource an attractive option for investors. This represented an annualized dividend of $1 per share, up 6.4% from 94 cents in 2022.HeadwindsNiSource’s risks related to any delay in the completion of capital projects, interest rate increases and the failure of aging infrastructure are headwinds.

To skip the detailed analysis of the crude oil market, go directly to the 5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy.Crude oil is one of the most primed industries in the world. However, it is also quite volatile which has been quite evident in recent years. According to Maximize Market Research, the industry’s market size reached $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by 2029. The global oil reserves volume is at around 1.65 trillion barrels while 99.8 million barrels were consumed daily on average in 2022, up from 94.1 million barrels a day in 2021.Latest Updates on the Crude Oil MarketCrude oil prices went flying shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine to around $119 per barrel on March 6 due to sanctions on Russian fossil fuel imports by the USA and part of Europe. However, the prices have dropped down to the pre-war levels with crude oil trading at around $74 per barrel WTI.The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) February 2023 report predicts that the global oil supply could reach higher than the demand in the first half of 2023. However, we reported previously that for the full year 2023, the global oil demand is expected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to just shy of 102 million barrels per day. The biggest factor in this rise in demand is set to come from China as its travel restrictions ease and borders open up. Furthermore, the seasonal demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in Europe recently rose in winter. However, the US and OPEC warned that they are unable to increase the output which is expected to leave Europe in hot waters as Russia previously cut off some important pipeline flows of natural gas in retribution for imposing energy sanctions backed by the USA.Additionally, the recent collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank disturbed the equities market which also slightly affected the oil prices as they fell by around 2% on March 13. However, this seems temporary and is expected to be offset by the recovery in demand by China.Story continuesCrude Oil Market in the FutureIn one of our articles, we highlighted that the global oil demand will reach its peak between 2023 and 2025. Nevertheless, due to climate risks, the world is making a shift toward renewable energy sources which will offset the demand for crude oil and other fossil fuels in the future. The demand for coal-based energy is slowly declining and it is only a matter of time before the fossil fuel demand drop starts affecting crude oil.Nevertheless, crude oil is a much more important source of energy than coal, so the prices are expected to keep rising till the global crude oil reserves are exhausted in around 47 years. Even though renewable energy sources are taking over, the need for petrochemicals and long-distance travel will still keep the global oil demand stable. The IEA believes that by 2040, the demand will increase to 104.1 million barrels of oil per day from approximately 98 million in 2019. Furthermore, crude oil prices are also expected to increase because as time passes, cheap oil sources are set to decline gradually.In the current market, crude oil stocks might be volatile but several of them have remained to be some of the most profitable companies in the world and have decent shareholder returns. Some of the crude oil stocks that investors need to look out for are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions RisePhoto by Zbynek Burival on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe analyzed the global crude oil market and chose the best stocks to buy, keeping their hedge fund sentiment as the most important metric and taking the analyst ratings around each stock into consideration. Most of the companies on the list have strong balance sheets and have maintained good profitability over the years.  Moreover, their capital returns have also remained healthy.We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds. Note that we skipped the companies whose crude oil production covered less than 10% of their business portfolio.11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise11.

The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”10.

322,1720389b-b9bf-323b-aca4-234b6ea7b973,OXY,2023-03-15,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-occidental-petroleum-130001713.html,1678798801,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -8.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 11%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. This estimate has changed -6.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.01 indicates a change of -1.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $7.78 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.8%. The $31.82 billion and $31.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.2% and -1.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $8.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.61 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.95%. The EPS surprise was -12.02%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business.

However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Norfolk Southern' own record demonstrates that it knew – and should have taken appropriate steps to prevent – the significant harm that the derailment would cause,"" the lawsuit said.On Monday, Yost met with Norfolk Southern and discussed several issues including the creation of a ""fund to compensate for long-term losses to real estate values,"" improving East Palestine's water treatment.""This lawsuit is designed to make sure that Norfolk Southern keeps their word to the people of East Palestine,"" Yost said.Norfolk Southern said in a statement it was working toward creating three long-term funds to benefit East Palestine, including one providing ""tailored protection for home sellers if their property loses value"" because of the derailment.Story continuesThe railroad said environmental monitoring by state and federal agencies showed the air and water are safe. However, it said it supports a ""solution that addresses long-term health risks through the creation of a long-term medical compensation fund."" A third program would help protect East Palestine drinking water.""We look forward to working toward a final resolution with Attorney General Yost,"" the railroad said.Since the Ohio derailment caused cars carrying toxic vinyl chloride and other hazardous chemicals to spill and catch fire, Norfolk Southern has been under pressure over a number of train derailments.Last week, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw was sharply questioned at a U.S. Senate hearing and will appear at another March 22 rail safety Senate hearing.Shaw apologized, pledging to improve safety and address impacts including thoroughly cleaning the site. He said the railroad had already committed $21 million to the community as a ""down payment... I am committed to doing what's right for the community.""No deaths or injuries were reported after the incident but since the derailment, some of East Palestine's 4,700 residents have reported ailments such as rashes and breathing difficulties and say they fear long-term health effects.Residents and business owners have filed nearly two dozen lawsuits against Norfolk Southern since the derailment, seeking payment for property damages and for ongoing medical monitoring to detect potential latent disease for people who live within 30 miles of the crash site.Those suits claim Norfolk Southern was negligent and has created a nuisance for residents, among other claims for liability.Last week, Norfolk Southern agreed to create a new first responders training center and expand a training program in Ohio.

He said the company’s accident rate has increased 80% over 10 years.Dozens of civil suits have been filed since the train derailed en route from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania. The civil litigation could cost Norfolk Southern more than $100 million for remediation and other claims, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.The derailment created a risk of a catastrophic explosion due to the 20 or so cars carrying vinyl chloride — a component for some plastics. The material was drained and set alight days later in a controlled burn that generated a massive plume of smoke, forcing residents to flee and putting health at risk.“The fallout from this highly preventable accident is going to reverberate through Ohio for many years to come,” Yost said at the press conference. “The point of this lawsuit is to make sure that those long term effects are not only not forgot, but they are redressed.”Story continuesCleanup EffortIn a statement, Norfolk Southern said the company is committed to helping the affected communities, and that it is already making progress in the cleanup effort. Company representatives met with Yost this week to discuss a plan to develop programs for working with the state and community leaders long-term, it said.“Every day since the derailment, our goal has been to make it right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities,” Norfolk Southern said. “We are making progress every day cleaning the site safely and thoroughly, providing financial assistance to residents and businesses that have been affected, and investing to help East Palestine and the communities around it thrive.”Yost acknowledged Norfolk Southern’s commitments on Tuesday by saying his talks with company lawyers had been different so far than those of other “industrial polluters” he’s “done battle” with.The case is Ohio v.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$64.09 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$60.03. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$1.8b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Coca-Cola, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Coca-Cola you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

335,69d9f656-ab12-306a-ac31-0c0c3f0d426d,KO,2023-03-15,You'll Never Guess the Top-Performing Stock of the Last 20 Years,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youll-never-guess-top-performing-173152489.html,1678815112,STORY,"['AAPL', 'MO', 'MNST', 'KO']","[If a time machine could take you back to the start of the 2000s — without the desire to open up a crypto wallet — what’s the No. 1 investment you would make?Maybe Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?Or Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300,000 last year?Some savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant, formerly Phillip Morris International Inc., has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.But there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterThe Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street DarlingMonster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.Yet this energy drink company returned 87,560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.Why was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?Part of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.But there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022, its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.To keep the lights on, Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast, Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.Story continuesIt turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference, compounded over the years, means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.A similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC, it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?Sure enough, $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance, but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020, or less that 10% of what Apple paid.See Next: For investors looking to invest in startups in the beverage space, Trubrain also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable, but with just $17 million in sales since 2012, is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.Read More in Startup News &amp; Investing Opportunities: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using ItCollaborative Robots Startup Using Teams Of AI-Powered Drones To Make Flying SaferThe World's First Floating Lifestyle Club is Set To Launch This YearDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, General Mills Inc. GIS, The Clorox Co. CLX and Cincinnati Financial Corp. CINF.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Safe Stocks to Buy as SVB Collapse Shakes Wall StreetWall Street closed sharply lower last week following the collapse of the biggest regional bank. The Dow slid 4.4%, marking its biggest weekly decline since June 2022. The S&amp;P 500 shed 4.6%, reflecting its largest weekly drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.7%, posting the single-largest weekly fall since November 2022.On Mar 10, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) announced that regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and took control of its deposits. This was the biggest bank failure in the United States since the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008 and the second-biggest bank failure in the nation's history.The privately controlled Silicon Valley Bank is a subsidiary of the SVB Financial Group (SIVB). The 40-year-old highly respected regional bank, which lends primarily to technology and biotechnology startups, was the first major victim of the aggressive interest rate hike policies adopted by the Fed to combat record-high inflation. The collapse of SVB resulted in a nearly 16% drop in the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), last week.SVB Becomes First Major Victim of Aggressive Rate HikeThe SVB was a highly recognized brand lending to startups as well as venture capitals and private equities. Due to rigorous rate hikes by the Fed in the past year to combat record-high inflation, the startup companies find it extremely difficult to raise funds either through IPO or private investment.Story continuesStartup clients of SVB withdrew deposits with the bank in order to keep their business running. As a result, SVB became short of capital. On Mar 8, SVB announced that it needed to raise at least $2.25 billion immediately as the bank was compelled to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.75 billion loss.This situation triggered a panic in the venture capitalist community, especially among those who have invested in startups that are clients of SVB. Once the venture capitalists instructed their clients to withdraw deposits from SVB, a staggering $42 billion in deposits were removed by the end of Mar 9. SVB had a negative cash balance of $958 million. The bank failed to find a buyer, finally prompting the regulators to take control of its deposits.Broad-Market May Face Domino EffectA large section of economists and financial experts have warned the Federal Government to immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank's failure will shake the broad market. Nearly 95% of SVB's deposits are uninsured, and most of the money comes  from the bank's startup clients. These startup companies will find it difficult to pay their employees this month.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital Corp. (SI), a major lender to the crypto industry, announced that it would be shutting down operations and liquidating its bank. Moreover, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., has $3.3 billion of reserves held at SVB. The company is the issuer of the crypto's second-largest stablecoin, the USDC.Market participants are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. The SVB takes centerstage, providing seed capital, which is extremely important for early-stage startups. Following the collapse of SVB, venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, it will be prudent to stay with safe stocks. We use five selection criteria to find safe stocks. First, low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with market capital &gt; $10 billion. Second, stocks having a current dividend yield of more than 2%, which will act as an income stream during extreme volatility. Third, stocks that have solid growth potential for both top and bottom line in 2023.Fourth, stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days, indicating investor's expectation of strong business potential in 2023.

Cincinnati Financial expects 2023 property-casualty premium to grow 8% while its agent-focused business model should drive long-term premium growth.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks provide several advantages to income investors, including regular income, the potential for growth, and long-term returns. The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year.

Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list.

In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

""Our company strives to be trailblazers in our industry and make positive contributions through our environmental and sustainability initiatives. This project advances our company's goals and creates value while meeting customer and society's needs, and it involved a collaborative effort between multiple project teams at Bayport, Channelview and around the world to deliver a project of this magnitude.""The PO/TBA project is a split facility design, intended to optimize production and leverage synergies shared by the LyondellBasell Channelview Complex located in Channelview, Texas and the LyondellBasell Bayport Complex located in Pasadena, Texas. The 140-acre PO/TBA plant was built at the Channelview Complex, while the associated 34-acre ethers unit, which will convert TBA to oxyfuels, was built at the Bayport Complex.The project is part of the company's multi-billion dollar series of investments along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

LYB and renewable energy producer Grenergy recently signed five long-term solar power purchase agreements (PPAs). Under the 15-year contracts, Spain-based Grenergy will supply solar energy from the La Cereal solar farm project, which is slated to be operational by the end of 2025. The agreements represent around 329,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of solar power annually, equivalent to more than 90,000 European homes' annual electricity consumption.LyondellBasell has accomplished 70% of its goal to get at least 50% of its power from renewable sources by 2030 through these agreements. More than 2.9 million MWh of renewable electricity will be delivered by the company's PPA portfolio, and its scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions will be lowered by more than a million tons.

We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Specifically, we decided to study Vulcan Materials'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vulcan Materials is:8.6% = US$595m ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Vulcan Materials' Earnings Growth And 8.6% ROEAt first glance, Vulcan Materials' ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. As a result, Vulcan Materials' flat net income growth over the past five years doesn't come as a surprise given its lower ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Vulcan Materials' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 15% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is VMC worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether VMC is currently mispriced by the market.Is Vulcan Materials Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 29% (meaning the company retains71% of profits) in the last three-year period, Vulcan Materials' earnings growth was more or les flat. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, Vulcan Materials has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 22% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Vulcan Materials' performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

It seeks to maintain appropriate pricing discipline for both new and renewal business.Cincinnati Financial expects property casualty premium growth rate in 2023 to be 8%.Investment income should continue to rise because of the increase in equity portfolio dividends and increase in interest income from fixed-maturity securities.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, General Mills Inc. GIS, The Clorox Co. CLX and Cincinnati Financial Corp. CINF.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Safe Stocks to Buy as SVB Collapse Shakes Wall StreetWall Street closed sharply lower last week following the collapse of the biggest regional bank. The Dow slid 4.4%, marking its biggest weekly decline since June 2022. The S&amp;P 500 shed 4.6%, reflecting its largest weekly drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.7%, posting the single-largest weekly fall since November 2022.On Mar 10, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) announced that regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and took control of its deposits. This was the biggest bank failure in the United States since the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008 and the second-biggest bank failure in the nation's history.The privately controlled Silicon Valley Bank is a subsidiary of the SVB Financial Group (SIVB). The 40-year-old highly respected regional bank, which lends primarily to technology and biotechnology startups, was the first major victim of the aggressive interest rate hike policies adopted by the Fed to combat record-high inflation. The collapse of SVB resulted in a nearly 16% drop in the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), last week.SVB Becomes First Major Victim of Aggressive Rate HikeThe SVB was a highly recognized brand lending to startups as well as venture capitals and private equities. Due to rigorous rate hikes by the Fed in the past year to combat record-high inflation, the startup companies find it extremely difficult to raise funds either through IPO or private investment.Story continuesStartup clients of SVB withdrew deposits with the bank in order to keep their business running. As a result, SVB became short of capital. On Mar 8, SVB announced that it needed to raise at least $2.25 billion immediately as the bank was compelled to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.75 billion loss.This situation triggered a panic in the venture capitalist community, especially among those who have invested in startups that are clients of SVB. Once the venture capitalists instructed their clients to withdraw deposits from SVB, a staggering $42 billion in deposits were removed by the end of Mar 9. SVB had a negative cash balance of $958 million. The bank failed to find a buyer, finally prompting the regulators to take control of its deposits.Broad-Market May Face Domino EffectA large section of economists and financial experts have warned the Federal Government to immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank's failure will shake the broad market. Nearly 95% of SVB's deposits are uninsured, and most of the money comes  from the bank's startup clients. These startup companies will find it difficult to pay their employees this month.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital Corp. (SI), a major lender to the crypto industry, announced that it would be shutting down operations and liquidating its bank. Moreover, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., has $3.3 billion of reserves held at SVB. The company is the issuer of the crypto's second-largest stablecoin, the USDC.Market participants are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. The SVB takes centerstage, providing seed capital, which is extremely important for early-stage startups. Following the collapse of SVB, venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, it will be prudent to stay with safe stocks. We use five selection criteria to find safe stocks. First, low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with market capital &gt; $10 billion. Second, stocks having a current dividend yield of more than 2%, which will act as an income stream during extreme volatility. Third, stocks that have solid growth potential for both top and bottom line in 2023.Fourth, stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days, indicating investor's expectation of strong business potential in 2023. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NASDAQ:GEHC) most popular amongst retail investors who own 59% of the shares, institutions hold 21%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-healthcare-technologies-inc-nasdaq-113633252.html,1678880193,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsSignificant control over GE HealthCare Technologies by retail investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders 21% of GE HealthCare Technologies is held by InstitutionsEvery investor in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 59% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Meanwhile, institutions make up 21% of the company’s shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of GE HealthCare Technologies, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in GE HealthCare Technologies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of GE HealthCare Technologies, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthGE HealthCare Technologies is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is General Electric Company, with ownership of 20%. With 7.8% and 2.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$50m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 59% stake in GE HealthCare Technologies, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 20% of GE HealthCare Technologies. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand GE HealthCare Technologies better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - GE HealthCare Technologies has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

351,52f2ac34-888c-3179-89ac-a5428cad1911,GE,2023-03-15,12 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-aerospace-stocks-buy-015707388.html,1678845427,STORY,"['HWM-P', 'TXT', 'HON', 'GD', 'HEI-A', 'LHX', 'GE', 'LMT', 'NOC', 'TDG']","[In this article, we discuss the 12 best aerospace stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Previously we cited a survey by Deloitte, where 88% of senior executives believed that the outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is positive to some extent. Their optimism was based on various factors such as the emergence of new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, the evolution of business models, increased exploration of space, and the utilization of digital thread and smart factories. Similarly, Fitch Ratings reported that the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector is showing signs of improvement, and there is potential for growing cash flows and debt reduction capacity from 2023 due to favorable demand patterns. Fitch predicts that commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will benefit from the strong global demand for new aircraft fleets as global travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the potential risks of recession in the near future.On March 9, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw a significant increase in its stock value after predicting that the profit margins of its aviation division, which now primarily focuses on producing and servicing jet engines, would continue to expand as an independent business. The company also expects the aerospace division to experience revenue growth at a mid-to-high single digit rate and generate free cash flow equivalent to its net income in the same period. According to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), the combined power-equipment and renewable energy units are expected to experience mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit margins, despite the current challenges faced by the wind turbine business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has also reconfirmed its financial targets for 2023, which include more than doubling its adjusted earnings and generating up to $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesAir travel was expected to make a major comeback in 2023, with China reopening, airlines increasing the number of flights and airports hiring more staff to handle the expected surge in demand. However, the growth of air travel could be hindered by a potential bottleneck caused by a shortage of aircraft engines and spare parts, especially for popular Airbus SE and Boeing jets. The situation is worsening because more airlines are using the latest-generation turbines, which are up to 20% more fuel efficient but require more frequent maintenance cycles than their sturdier predecessors. Even before the pandemic, the industry was already experiencing supply chain constraints, and since the pandemic, engine manufacturers have been facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled mechanics and component shortages. These challenges have been affecting the industry significantly. Some of the best aerospace stocks to buy include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Our Methodology For this article, we shortlisted aerospace companies and selected the following aerospace stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyPhoto by NASA on UnsplashBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy12. Howmet Aerospace Inc.

The reason for this upgrade is the company's impressive Q4 results and the forecasted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings for 2023. According to Argus, business trends at Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM) are favorable, and the new price target indicates a multiple that is more in line with the industry average for normalized earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM), compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the largest investor in the company. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Howmet Aerospace Inc.

It is one of the best aerospace stocks to buy. Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag believes that the announcement of the U.S. Army awarding the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) is a significant development that will contribute to long-term growth of military aircraft at Bell. The analyst expects that this news will be received positively by the market. Although Textron's DEFIANT X aircraft surpassed Lockheed Martin’s and Boeing’s offering in the competition, Liwag noted that the losing parties could potentially contest the award decision, leading to additional delays until the matter is resolved. Despite this uncertainty, the analyst maintained an Overweight rating and a $84 price target on Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) shares on December 6. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 36 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter.

(NASDAQ:AXON) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On March 7, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) with a Buy rating and a $263 price target. The company is in a strong position to sell a range of sensors, including body and fleet cameras, as well as software and cloud storage and analytics services.

Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) also has over 10 years of contracted revenue, which gives good visibility into revenue growth, as per Goldman Sachs. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 38 hedge funds were long Axon Enterprise, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AXON) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), a public safety-focused technology company, rose during the quarter following a strong earnings report in which full-year revenue guidance was raised. Notable strength in the Axon Cloud segment reflects increased domestic demand for software-heavy premium integrated bundles. We believe the company has a line of sight to a more than 20% average annual revenue growth, an improving margin profile with software solutions growth, and the potential to become the dominant ecosystem in the public safety space.”9. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was founded in 1885 and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is a global technology and manufacturing firm with diverse operations. Honeywell International Inc.

(NASDAQ:HON) is in a good position in the current economic climate due to its diversified exposure to different end-markets. However, HSBC also noted that the stock's valuation premium already reflects this favorable exposure, which means that the current price already takes into account these positive factors.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 44 hedge funds were bullish on Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Zevenbergen Capital Investments is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 551,594 shares worth $91.5 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments has to say about Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“The portfolio’s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included industrials, Honeywell also lagged in the quarter after previously generating strong returns over extended periods.”8. L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) is a Florida-based aerospace and defense technology company that specializes in mission-critical solutions for government and commercial customers worldwide.

(NYSE:LHX)’s initial guidance for 2023 may be conservative. However, he also noted that concerns about budget constraints and supply chain disruptions are still affecting the stock's performance.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 45 hedge funds were long L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“We also exited our position in L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris’ recent quarterly results showed some pandemic-related impact on the company’s business, though relative to other industrials stocks, the effect has been quite modest, and it is achieving ahead-of-schedule synergies from its recent merger. However, concerns about ballooning federal deficits and potential associated defense-budget cuts have been a headwind. We share these concerns, and with the company’s market cap above the mid-cap range, we concluded our campaign to fund newer profit cycle opportunities.”7.

We eliminated the position to fund more attractive holdings.”6. HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) is a Florida-based company that designs, manufactures, and distributes aerospace, defense, and electronic products and services.

While prohibiting further drilling on more than 13 million acres in Alaska and the Arctic Ocean, the Biden administration has recently approved the construction of the Willow oil drilling project on Alaska's North Slope.In Willow, the firm initially planned to drill from five well pads, believing that anything less than that would not be economically feasible. The petroleum reserve, which is situated roughly 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, would be the site of the drilling operation. The reserve is the single biggest expanse of pristine land in the nation and has no roads.The $8 billion Willow project, headed by oil tycoon ConocoPhillips, is anticipated to produce more than 600 million barrels of petroleum over a 30-year period. There’s a possibility of almost 280 million metric tons of carbon emissions by burning all that oil. That would result in 9.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually, which is the same as adding nearly 2 million new automobiles to the road.The Biden administration's intentions to safeguard the Arctic have been welcomed by climate activists. However, they are upset that it would authorize a project they term as ""carbon bomb"", and this decision is sure to meet legal challenges from environmental groups.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, ConocoPhillips carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy space are CVR Energy CVI and Valero Energy Corporation VLO, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 and Murphy USA Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks provide several advantages to income investors, including regular income, the potential for growth, and long-term returns. The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some well-known dividend stocks that have rewarded shareholders with consistent dividend growth and have sound financials.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”14.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $5.4 billion.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

(NYSE:TMO) is an American company that specializes in supplying scientific instrumentation and consumables.

(NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 1.11%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is next on our list of the best dividend-paying stocks to buy now. The American private banking company was a part of 97 hedge fund portfolios in Q4 2022, up from 90 in the previous quarter, as tracked by Insider Monkey.

The company remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning approximately $1 billion to investors in dividends in FY22.Andvari Associated mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”6.

The figure was in line with the prior-year quarter’s tally.The results reflected healthy leasing demand during the fourth quarter, with tenant sales continuing to gain momentum. The portfolio occupancy and re-leasing spreads improved year over year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has driven the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, Macerich’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor, has been experiencing healthy leasing activity.In 2022, Macerich signed 974 new and renewal leases encompassing around 3.8 million square feet. Its portfolio occupancy improved year over year from 91.5% to 92.6% on Dec 31, 2022.Moreover, these densely populated areas have an affluent customer base with significant disposable income. This has helped the company capture the post-pandemic rebound in retail demand, aiding its cash flow generation.In February 2023, Macerich announced the addition of the Irish retail brand Primark at its popular Queens Center in New York City. Primark will occupy 54,562 square feet of multi-level space. The move deepens the relationship between both entities, with the latest opening marking Primark’s seventh store at a Macerich property.In March 2023, the company announced that its popular Queens Center in New York City will welcome the sought-after European fashion retailer — Zara. It is expected that Zara will open a multi-level location. The move is likely to draw more shoppers to this well-known retail destination, boding well for Macerich.Further, in the same month, MAC announced the addition of Din Tai Fung to Santa Monica Place. This Chinese restaurant, specializing in Xiao Long Bao, or soup dumplings, will occupy a prime, 10,615-square-foot indoor/outdoor location with ocean views on the third level of the property. It is also across from the newly announced ARTE MUSEUM.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained momentum and has become the focal point for many retailers. In line with this, MAC has been focusing on enhancing its asset quality and customer relationships by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model. The company has also been shifting toward re-use and mixed-used properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants.Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.As of Dec 31, 2022, MAC had around $512 million of liquidity, including unrestricted cash in hand, aggregating almost $158 million. The balance represented the available capacity on its revolving line of credit. Its well-laddered debt maturity profile and ample financial flexibility have positioned it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Macerich has remained committed to that. In October 2022, it increased the quarterly cash dividend payment from 15 cents per share to 17 cents, reflecting a hike of 13.3%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Also, amid the inflationary environment and rising interest rates, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Airline players like United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group ALK are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry  houses players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air-travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is another positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryBuoyant Air Traffic: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst-hit industries in the peak COVID-19 period. People are again resorting to air travel with the resumption of normal activities. The removal of COVID-related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well. Recently, the United States ended COVID testing requirements for passengers from China. The restrictions had been in effect since Jan 5, following the renewed outbreak in China. This rosy scenario with respect to air traffic is likely to stay as is evident from the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) expectation of airlines returning to profitability in 2023.Story continuesFocus on Cargo Revenues Bodes Well: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Highlighting the focus on cargo revenues, United Airlines’ revenues from cargo improved 49.4% in fourth-quarter 2022 from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $472 million. Per IATA’s forecast, cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which though lower than the 2022 levels are still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.High Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to high fuel and labor costs. The spike in fuel costs (oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period) is not a welcome development as expenses on fuel represent a major input cost for airlines. Moreover, with U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked recently in the space. This will result in an increase in labor costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #42, which places it in the top 17% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 13.5% since September 2022.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 3.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s depreciation of 10.9% and the broader sector’s decrease of 10.3%.One-Year Price PerformanceThe Valuation PictureThe price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.40X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.35X. It is also below the sector’s forward-12-month P/S of 1.57X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.67X.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Sales Ratio (Past Five Years) 3 Transportation - Airline Stocks to BuyAll three stocks discussed below presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).United Airlines has a market capitalization of $15.97 billion and is presently based in Chicago.

The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand both in domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines.Notably, the Zacks Airline industry has risen 6.9% over the past six months, outperforming the 0.5% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector and 2.9% decline of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank #55, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Here we present three airline players — Copa Holdings, S.A., American Airlines Group Inc. and AlaskaAir Group, Inc. — which are gaining from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs will continue to affect the bottom-line growth of the industry players.3 Airline Stocks to Pick NowGiven this encouraging backdrop, we present three airline stocks that have strong growth potential for 2023.

CPA exited 2022 with a consolidated fleet of 97 aircraft, which comprises 67 Boeing 737-800s, 20 Boeing 737 MAX 9s, 9 Boeing 737-700s and 1 Boeing 737-800 freighter.

Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, in the March quarter, total revenues per available seat miles are expected to be 24-27%, higher than the first-quarter 2022 actuals. The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025-end.

Alaska Air expects to boost its fleet and also workforce in 2023 to meet the anticipated high demand. In a bid to modernize its fleet, Alaska Airlines announced in October the decision to exercise its option of purchasing 52 more 737 MAX jets from Boeing.

I have interviewed over 1,000 top CEOs–and seen their sentiment and priorities change over time.The movement is mainly driven by the widespread transparency enabled by social media and a passionate younger generation who are committed to building a better world. And while purpose-driven companies have existed for well over a century, the second wave of purpose-committed companies, “Purpose 2.0,” is now becoming central.We know the benefits of being a purpose-driven business: galvanizing the employee and company alumni bases while speaking to all stakeholders who increasingly care about our impact on the world. As Deepak Chopra recently once shared with me, “Today’s CEOs must be part of our global ecosystem.”Here are three common mistakes that can turn the rush for purpose into fool’s gold.Don’t follow the crowd because it’s fashionableI majored in environmental studies undergrad in 1983. And although sustainability is a viscerally important issue to me, it does not have to be the focus of every purpose-driven company. Instead, businesses must ensure the issue is aligned with the brand and the employees. Every brand has its own purpose. What is important is to be authentic and involve the entire enterprise.Aflac found what is important to them–and that is helping childhood cancer. Since 1995, they have contributed more than $160 million to childhood cancer causes. This was corporate social responsibility–long before CSR became an acronym.Aflac CEO Dan Amos told me, “When I became CEO in 1990, giving back to the community wasn’t a strategy, it was just the right thing to do–and we rarely talked about it. Today, consumers and investors want to know about a company’s purpose before making decisions. We’ve always given back, but now it is also important to proactively share information about how your company is involved in the community.”Story continuesThe concept of purpose has been through a fascinating journey.“Purpose wasn’t a common element of corporate strategy 10 years ago but organizations are now seeing the invaluable role of purpose, so it has become a centerpiece on leadership agendas. As organizations turn their focus to measuring the outcomes of their purpose goals, they’re seeing the importance of embedding purpose into everything they do to ensure their efforts can weather macro conditions and create lasting impact felt by their people, clients, and communities,” Kwasi Mitchell, Deloitte’s Chief Purpose Officer, explained.Don’t underestimate accountabilityOne of the biggest breakthroughs in Purpose 2.0 is transparency. Johanna (José) Zeilstra, the CEO of Gender Fair outlines, “The most purposeful companies rely on data to quantify and measure progress, and then share this publicly to keep themselves accountable. For example, a recent study of the largest companies in the U.S. uncovered that 47% publicly disclose their full, or a summary of, their EEO-1 reports–an annual data collection requirement for all employers with 100 or more employees to submit demographic workforce data, including data by race/ethnicity, sex, and job categories.”Businesses have also been increasingly measuring their indirect impact on communities. Teresa “Terry” Rasmussen, CEO of Thrivent, a Fortune 500 diversified financial service company shared, “ We have deep expertise and experience mobilizing our employees and our clients to make a positive impact in their communities and in the world. Specifically, in 2021, through our generosity programs, 1.9 million clients and others volunteered 10.7 million hours within their communities.”And it’s not enough just to measure, companies need to communicate. Four in five Americans agree companies should speak out on key issues, according to Purple Strategies CEO research. However they differ on when: 39% say they should speak out on any issue that aligns or conflicts with their company values, while 39% say they should speak out only on those issues connected to their business or brand.“We know that it’s no longer an option to sit on the sidelines–Americans’ expectations of companies have shifted drastically, and companies’ and leaders’ reputations are impacted by what they say as much as what they don’t. A company’s purpose is one important decision-making lens and compass in navigating the boundaries of where they should and should not engage,” Chris Durlak, a partner and strategist at Purple Strategies, said.Purpose is more than a ‘nice’ initiativeEdie Fraser, the CEO of WBC, Women’s Business Collaborative, (where in full disclosure I am a board member), says CEOs are now making purpose part of he DNA of an organization. “Today’s CEO leadership is all about purpose and authentic and transparent leadership.”Newman’s Own, Inc. is a food company with a radical legacy of “giving it all away”–100% of its profits going to Newman’s Own Foundation, which helps children who face adversity.“Paul Newman pioneered the unique practice of “giving it all away” with 100% of our profits going to help make the world a better place. Selling products that not only taste good but do good is a legacy that we are proud to carry on,” David Best, the CEO and president of Newman’s Own, Inc. explains.The magic of being a purpose-driven company is you don’t have to consider what others want you to be. Instead, you can decide what unique value and model you believe your company can bring to society.Authenticity is key. Any organization can become a company of purpose–the secret sauce is just finding what’s genuinely important to you and determining how you can amplify it to make the world a better place.Robert Reiss is the founder and CEO of The CEO Forum Group.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:The return to the office could be the real reason for the slump in productivity.

372,a1afa509-e508-32a6-83f4-fb996f4476a1,FRT,2023-03-15,Here's Why Macerich's (MAC) Stock Jumped 15.3% in 6 Months,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-macerichs-mac-stock-121612289.html,1678796172,STORY,"['MAC', 'FRT']","[Shares of The Macerich Company MAC have soared 15.3% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 4.2%.Last month, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT), headquartered in Santa Monica, CA, reported fourth-quarter funds from operations (FFO) per share of 53 cents, excluding financing expenses in relation to Chandler Freehold, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure was in line with the prior-year quarter’s tally.The results reflected healthy leasing demand during the fourth quarter, with tenant sales continuing to gain momentum. The portfolio occupancy and re-leasing spreads improved year over year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has driven the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, Macerich’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor, has been experiencing healthy leasing activity.In 2022, Macerich signed 974 new and renewal leases encompassing around 3.8 million square feet. Its portfolio occupancy improved year over year from 91.5% to 92.6% on Dec 31, 2022.Moreover, these densely populated areas have an affluent customer base with significant disposable income. This has helped the company capture the post-pandemic rebound in retail demand, aiding its cash flow generation.In February 2023, Macerich announced the addition of the Irish retail brand Primark at its popular Queens Center in New York City. Primark will occupy 54,562 square feet of multi-level space. The move deepens the relationship between both entities, with the latest opening marking Primark’s seventh store at a Macerich property.In March 2023, the company announced that its popular Queens Center in New York City will welcome the sought-after European fashion retailer — Zara. It is expected that Zara will open a multi-level location. The move is likely to draw more shoppers to this well-known retail destination, boding well for Macerich.Further, in the same month, MAC announced the addition of Din Tai Fung to Santa Monica Place. This Chinese restaurant, specializing in Xiao Long Bao, or soup dumplings, will occupy a prime, 10,615-square-foot indoor/outdoor location with ocean views on the third level of the property. It is also across from the newly announced ARTE MUSEUM.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained momentum and has become the focal point for many retailers. In line with this, MAC has been focusing on enhancing its asset quality and customer relationships by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model. The company has also been shifting toward re-use and mixed-used properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants.Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.As of Dec 31, 2022, MAC had around $512 million of liquidity, including unrestricted cash in hand, aggregating almost $158 million. The balance represented the available capacity on its revolving line of credit. Its well-laddered debt maturity profile and ample financial flexibility have positioned it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Macerich has remained committed to that. In October 2022, it increased the quarterly cash dividend payment from 15 cents per share to 17 cents, reflecting a hike of 13.3%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Also, amid the inflationary environment and rising interest rates, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s current-year FFO per share is pegged at $6.45.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty Trust’s ongoing year’s FFO per share stands at $1.64.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:PEP) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.83bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bUS$12.2bUS$12.6bUS$13.1bUS$13.5bUS$13.9bUS$14.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$8.3kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.7kUS$8.7kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$83bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$305bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$305b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$158bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$241b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$174, the company appears about fair value at a 0.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For PepsiCo, we've put together three relevant factors you should assess:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for PepsiCo  you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for PEP's future outlook?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks provide several advantages to income investors, including regular income, the potential for growth, and long-term returns. The current inflation and risks of a recession have gravitated investors’ attention toward these equities as passive income has become their priority. Reinvesting dividends is also important in this regard, as it leads to compounding returns over time.In one of its reports, Schroders revealed the positive performance of dividends. The report examined stocks across different markets and their performance when dividends are reinvested. The annual average growth across eight markets came in at 4.3% over the past 25 years, which was increased to 7.1% with reinvested dividends.Professor Siegel’s research in his book The Future of Investors further elaborates on high-dividend stocks and how dividends influence the overall market’s returns. Siegel divided the performance of the S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks into quintiles with the main focus on companies with high dividends. According to the research, stocks with high dividend yields outperformed the broader market by over 1.6% per year from 1957 to 2022.Investors are steadily investing in dividend stocks to stay afloat this year. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are also experiencing record inflows, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. In the two weeks that ended February 22nd, investors have poured approximately $272 million into dividend ETFs and a record $48 billion in these funds last year. The trend of dividend investing is likely to continue this year as well as analysts are positive about dividend growth. In February, UBS Group AG spoke to Wall Street Journal about the dividend outlook for this year. The firm mentioned that dividends per share are expected to rise by 1% in 2023, despite a possible 11% fall in per-share earnings.Story continuesDaniel Dusina, director of investments at Blue Chip Partners, talked to Forbes about a reliable dividend investment strategy to beat inflation. Here are some comments from Dusina:“In this type of environment, simply targeting companies that currently offer the highest dividend yield is not enough. As inflation and tighter financial conditions hit corporations, investors should look for greater certainty that a company’s profitability, and ultimately their ability to pay an attractive dividend, will not be impaired.”When analyzing dividend stocks, investors turn to companies with strong dividend policies and solid cash positions. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some well-known dividend stocks that have rewarded shareholders with consistent dividend growth and have sound financials.

The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”14.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $5.4 billion.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Dividend Yield as of March 14: 0.80%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American business software company that mainly specializes in financial software. The company reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2023 with revenue of $3.04 billion, which showed a 13.9% growth from the same period last year. Moreover, its cash position also improved as the company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $612 million, up from $230 million in the prior-year period.On February 24, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends for the past 10 years, which places it as one of the best dividend-paying stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on March 14 came in at 0.80%.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also gained positive analysts' ratings due to its strong quarterly earnings. In February, Citigroup raised its price target on the stock to $475 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) grew to 92 in Q4 2022, from 86 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $5.6 billion.Fundsmith mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)10.

S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”8.

COVID-19 has exacerbated this issue and others, putting more minority and low-income populations at risk for extensive health complications, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).To help address this crisis, the Social and Health Research Center (SAHRC) of San Antonio, TX, under the leadership of Executive Director Dr. Roberto Trevino, developed the Bienestar/NEEMA Coordinated School Health Program (Bienestar). This evidence-based curriculum is designed to educate and engage children in positive behaviors that can significantly reduce the health risks of obesity, diabetes, respiratory ailments, and other predisposing conditions. Since its launch, Bienestar has been recognized as a successful intervention program by numerous public health and education agencies, including the CDC, the National Institutes for Health (NIH), the Texas Education Agency, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Cancer Institute.To influence behavior change, SAHRC is developing content that is both affordable for schools and engaging for students. With support from Q4HE, SAHRC is converting its kindergarten through 3rd-grade curriculum from a traditional textbook format to an interactive, digital animated platform, making it more economical for school districts and more compelling for students. This new platform utilizes age-appropriate, full-motion 3D animated characters, animated sing-alongs, tutorials, and gamification of quizzes and tests to inform, entertain, and inspire students to adopt healthy habits.""This grant from Q4HE provides a better chance of reaching more children and families with more effective health messaging. This means that we can help close the gap in health equity and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in more communities. Less disease means fewer sick days taken, less school missed, and longer lives lived. If that doesn't tug at your heartstrings, what does?""- Dr. Roberto Trevino Executive Director, SAHRCStory continuesThe Bienestar program is culturally appropriate and designed to engage high-risk students. Its coordinated lessons were created for use in health and physical education classes, in school food service programs, and in direct engagement with parents. SAHRC is using this curriculum to help reduce blood glucose and insulin levels, decrease obesity rates, increase dietary fiber intake, and increase fitness levels in children. With Q4HE's support, SAHRC will be able to expand its reach from San Antonio across the country, offering a more accessible, inspiring, and affordable curriculum for schools to engage underserved student populations.""The dramatic decrease in the cost of the Bienestar curriculum makes it accessible for school districts serving low-income communities. Through digitization of its content, the price for schools dropped from $18,000 for the printed version to under $1,000 for the digitized version. This puts the resource within reach so our students can improve their health and quality of life.""- Pedro Martinez Superintendent, San Antonio Independent School DistrictRead moreQuest Diagnostics , Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnosticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/743695/Educating-Early-Learners-To-Create-Better-Health-Outcomes]"

This compares to the stock's 19.3% loss over the past four weeks.After stumbling significantly over the past few trading day, the trend reversed. Following the fall out of the collapse of two S&amp;P 500 banks, the investors regained some confidence in the finance sector amid the steps taken by the regulators to avert a full-blown bank run. Moreover, inflation numbers came out as expected, which further reinforced investor optimism. These developments drove the AMP stock higher.This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.9%. Revenues are expected to be $3.71 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Ameriprise, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

Market participants remained highly concerned that the ripple effect of the bank’s failure may shake the broad market. However, a sliver lining in the SVB disaster is that the Fed may be compelled to stick to a 25 basis points hike in interest rate in its March FOMC meeting.A Hawkish FedThe Fed hiked the benchmark interest by a staggering 4.25% in 2022 to combat 40-year high inflation. The inflation rate reached its peak at 9.1% in June 2022 and thereafter declined to 6 — 6.5% in December, though it stayed significantly higher than the central bank’s 2% target rate.A steady decline in the inflation rate in the last three months of 2022 enabled the Fed to reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 25 basis points. However, a sudden spike in inflation in January and a series of strong economic data changed the whole scenario.On Mar 7 and 8, in his testimony to the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that interest rates are likely to head higher than what central bank policymakers had anticipated. In the December FOMC meeting, Fed officials had estimated the terminal interest rate to be at 5.1% for this rate hike cycle.However, after Powell’s testimony, the CME FedWatch showed that market participants expect the terminal interest rate to be within 5.5% to 5.75% range. Moreover, the CME FedWatch showed a 73.5% probability that the Fed would hike the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in the March FOMC meeting while the probability of a 25 basis-points hike is just 26.5%. These situations were almost reversed just before the release of Powell’s testimony.Government Assures SVB Depositors About Their MoneyMarket participants’ expectations regarding rate hike have changed significantly after last week’s SVB debacle. The bank is the first major casualty of the Fed’s aggressive rate hike. A large section of economists and financial experts have warned that the Federal Government should immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank’s failure will shake the broad market.Story continuesInvestors are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. Clients of SVB’s startup companies, especially from the technology sector, will find it hard to run their business. Venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital. This has forced the U.S. government to assure all SVB depositors about their money.Moreover, the Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls came in at 311,000 in February, beating the consensus estimate of 227,000. However, the number declined significantly from January’s data of 504,000.The unemployment rate increased to 3.6% in February from 3.4% in January. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% in February compared with a 0.3% rise in January. Year over year, hourly wage rate rose 4.6% in February, below the consensus estimate of 4.8%.Consequently, the CME FedWatch is now showing an overwhelming 70.9% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the March FOMC meeting. Importantly, 29.1% respondents expect the central bank to keep the interest rate static at the current range of 4.5 to 4.75%. No respondent expects a more than 25 basis point rate hike.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have applied our VGM Style Score to narrow the search to select five companies that have strong earnings growth potential for 2023.

To become a large-cap company, the business must prove its worth over an extended period (usually) while under constant public scrutiny of professional investors.

The company is divided into four segments: U.S. consumer services, commercial services, international card services, and global merchant and network services.American Express has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter sales are projected to grow 19% to $14 billion, while current quarter earnings are expected to fall -2.6% to $2.66 per share. Current quarter declines are primarily due to increased marketing and business development expenses. Next quarter and current year earnings are expected to resume strong growth, with current year earnings forecasted at $11.24 per share, a 14% YoY increase.Current quarter earnings revisions have also seen mixed updates, although they are still up slightly over the last 90 days. The rest of the timeframes have seen significant revisions higher over the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last ten years AXP stock has averaged annual returns of 10%.

With a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14x it is just below its 10-year median of 15x. AXP also offers a dividend yield of 1.5%, which it has raised an average of 7.5% annually over the last five years.

At Cisco, through the Proximity Initiative, we've spent the last three years on a journey to do just that.When getting proximate there is the fear of saying something inappropriate and/or offending someone. No one fully understands the lived experiences of another person. The truth is we must have the courage and willingness to be passionately curious in these conversations.I've personally experienced this same trepidation during many of my proximity conversations. I vividly remember a particular conversation where my proximity partner and I discovered that we had different sexual orientations. My partner shared that she is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Candidly, I was frightened to inquire about her sexuality; however, in that moment, I thought to myself this is my opportunity to listen, learn, seek to understand while being respectful and honoring her identity. I hesitated, spoke softly, and in a self-doubting, insecure manner asked my questions, which were met with gratitude because she was confident I wanted to genuinely educate myself and learn about her truths. She shared with me how she views her sexuality and about how her experiences, as a bisexual woman, have shaped and impacted her perspectives. This conversation convinced me, as a heterosexual man, it's my responsibility to learn and grow from the insights she shared. This proximity conversation and many others have helped me to become more aware of my own power and privilege.At its core, the Proximity Initiative is a one-on-one conversation between a Cisco Executive and an employee, specifically those from our Inclusive Communities (Employee Resource Organizations/Groups), with the intention to have a conversation across differences. It is not a career conversation nor mentorship, but simply a conversation to share, listen, and learn about our lived experiences.Story continuesIn this blog, we're going to go behind the scenes to find out ""what's really going on"" and share the tangible impact and the intrinsic learning opportunity of the Cisco Proximity Initiative.Here are three areas of insights we've uncovered over the last three years:Getting Proximate can be uncomfortable at first Since 2019, there have been over 1,700 Proximity meetings inclusive of each of Cisco's global regions and functional business units. Through feedback from participants and leaders, we have learned to get truly proximate. It is important to understand some of the common barriers to these kinds of conversations. Creating an environment of mutual sharing and learning requires:Understanding how Proximity is different: Proximity is not about advancing one's career. It is not a mentorship or sponsorship program. It is an intentional, inclusive action leaders and participants take in the spirit of creating a conscious culture. We view this as an opportunity to make a self-less contribution towards our transformation by sharing our lived experiences, empathically seeking to understand, and self-reflection for personal development.Proximity requires intention: Some leaders believe that casually meeting with people and having a general conversation is getting proximate, but it requires so much more. Leaders must be intentional about holding space, staying open and a willingness to lean into curiosity and empathy. To honor the experiences of those sharing stories, leaders must move past a ""check the box"" meeting and invest in authentic conversations.Proximity crosses the full spectrum of diversity: It extends beyond race and gender and it's inclusive of all aspects of identity. Our focus is underrepresented and underserved communities. The idea is to have a conversation to understand how we all experience culture differently.Vulnerability: Proximity meetings are deep and intimate conversations focused on sharing our life experiences. To make meaningful Proximity connections, leaders need to lean into the discomfort of being vulnerable and be curious with an ambition to learn. Leaders must be transparent regarding the intentions of the meetings and take responsibility for creating an atmosphere of safety and trust for inclusive community participants. Leaders and participants need to be open about their own experiences and how those experiences have shaped their perspectives.When having vulnerable and courageous conversations, it requires a new capability - a mindset of being humble, transparent, and willing to learn in those moments of discomfort. We are working to build this capability with each leader in the organization. At Cisco, we believe that listening and learning with empathy is a leadership superpower, and over the last three years, it has become a leadership expectation.Engaging in Proximity drives connectionOur original intention for Proximity was to have in-person meetings, but the pandemic forced us to quickly change how we get proximate. We found that meeting virtually levelled our ability to connect, as we were no longer bound by physical location barriers. We estimate over 90% of Proximity meetings are now completed through Webex.One of the main design principles of the Proximity Initiative is to design programs in collaboration with underrepresented groups and not for them. Hence why we ask participants to opt-in to participate in the program and invite them to provide feedback.In addition, our leaders will attend Proximity coaching on an annual basis. Leaders participate in a Proximity debrief session, where we facilitate discussions around what leaders have learned, how the conversations have impacted them, and develop a team action plan based on the insights from the conversations.Proximity is business criticalBased on a recent survey, 84% of Cisco employees who have participated in the Proximity Initiative have found incredible value in these discussions. A Proximity participant wrote ""having a Vice President reach out and want to speak to me, I'm bolder and more authentic than before. I'm all in; that sense of belonging is there, knowing I have folks who support everything about me…I'm able to bring up and advocate in my team for things that I wouldn't have before.""Another participant shared ""…the impact on me was outstanding. Having the conversation with my leader made me feel heard and that my experiences were valid. She made me feel comfortable to tell my stories and acknowledged that things in our company need to change - it made me feel hope for the future.""Ninety-seven percent (97%) of participating leaders have also found immense value in these discussions. Ninety-five percent (95%) of leaders indicated they now lead differently as a result of their Proximity conversations. Eric Knipp, Cisco's Vice President of Systems Engineering for the Americas Theatre (geographical market), shared, ""With the insights I have gained through proximity I have learned how things as simple as arranging a golf outing can be exclusive. This insight has helped me understand how negative experiences can be created and subsequently avoided, by simply being more aware.""As Bryan Stevenson, founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has taught us, ""Learning is an action."" We believe Proximity meetings are an extremely powerful inclusive action. Our leaders, with power and privilege, have an obligation to use that knowledge to change the narrative. To me, changing the narrative is deeper than just a change in mindset. It is a conviction that leaders must shift the paradigm. This conviction leads us to commit to the hard work ahead and to be willing to move through the discomfort as we drive transformation.My request to everyone, everywhere in the world, is to get proximate to people who are different from you and to understand their lived experiences. In these conversations, share your identity, be transparent about your intention to learn, and approach the discussion with humility and compassion. I think you will find that getting proximate allows us all to begin to live our purpose of an inclusive future…today.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/743657/The-Journey-and-Impact-of-Getting-Proximate]"
