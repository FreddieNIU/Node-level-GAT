Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ', ""The President, Leon Topalian, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$168 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$174. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 11% of Leon Topalian's stake."", 'Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Nucor shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!', 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', ""Over the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Nucor. We note insiders cashed in US$9.4m worth of shares. On the flip side, Director Nicholas Gangestad spent US$177k on purchasing shares (as mentioned above) . Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign."", ""I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$245m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Nucor, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Nucor (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing."", 'But note: Nucor may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

After peaking at an all-time high of nearly CNY 600,000 ($84,015) per tonne in November 2022, lithium carbonate prices have crashed to CNY 97,500 ($13,650) per tonne thanks mainly to a global oversupply. The lithium price crash has been so shocking that a Wall Street analyst has predicted the markets could swing in the opposite direction and\xa0\xa0usher in a lithium shortage\xa0as early as 2025.', 'The same goes for another critical battery metal, nickel, with prices cut nearly in half thanks, again, to supply outpacing demand. The nickel market is facing a supply-demand surplus of 239,000 tonnes, the\xa0largest surplus in at least a decade, the International Nickel Study Group (INSG) has reported. That’s way higher than the group’s last forecast whereby it predicted the surplus will clock in at 171,000 tonnes in the current year.', 'Grains and Soft Commodities', 'The grains markets have not fared any better, with oat futures being the only grain contract to finish in the green after posting a small 1.2% gain. Soybeans and its associated products and wheat have posted double-digit declines with corn falling the most after plunging nearly 30% in the year-to-date. Meanwhile, lean hog futures have declined 21% YTD while feeder cattle futures have pulled back nearly 20% from the September peak due to an influx of supply.', 'The wide pullback has come after grain prices soared in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Egypt's blue-chip index advanced 0.8%, extending its 2023 gains to a 70.5%. Top lender Commercial International Bank was up 75% over the year while tobacco monopoly Eastern Company concluded the year 98.5% higher than at the start of 2023. Annual inflation in Egypt had been working its way higher for two years, hitting a record 38% in September. In the past few months an already weakened currency has plunged to about 50 pounds to the US dollar on the black market compared with the official rate of 30.85 pounds. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index rose 0.3%, up 14.2% over the year, on expectations of interest rate cuts in 2024. Oil giant Saudi Aramco added 13.1% for its biggest annual gain since listing in December 2019 despite receding oil prices. Markets expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting US interest rates in March, according to the CME FedWatch tool, a shift from assumptions last month. Monetary policy in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council is usually guided by the Fed's decisions because most regional currencies are pegged to the dollar. However, the Saudi index gains were capped by weak oil prices. Oil prices, which fuel the Gulf economies, dropped more than 10% in 2023, ending a two-year winning streak, as geopolitical concerns, production cuts and central bank measures to rein in inflation triggered big price fluctuations. A Reuters survey of 34 economists and analysts forecast that Brent crude will average $82.56 in 2024, down from November's $84.43 consensus, on expectations that weak global growth will cap demand. Continuing geopolitical tensions, however, could provide price support. The benchmark index in Qatar, the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), advanced 2.3% but was up only 1.4% annual for the year. US natural gas futures fell nearly 44% in 2023 for their biggest annual percentage fall since 2006, pressured by record production, ample inventories and relatively mild weather. Elsewhere, the Bahrain bourse registered a 4% annual gain while the Oman market was down more than 7% for the year. SAUDI ARABIA rose 0.3% to 11,967 QATAR gained 2.3% to 10,830 EGYPT up 0.8% to 24,894 BAHRAIN added 0.5% to 1,971 OMAN rose 0.6% to 4,514 (Reporting by Ateeq Shariff in Bengaluru Editing by David Goodman)""]"

Nvidia's\xa0stock deserved to soar because its chips were required to process high-end AI tasks. Microsoft's massive investment in OpenAI and the integration of its AI tools into its cloud-based services also made it a great play on that secular trend."", ""But beyond Nvidia and Microsoft, a lot of tech stocks shouldn't have been lifted with the rising AI tide. I believe C3.ai (NYSE: AI), Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) are three such stocks that could stumble in 2024."", ""C3.ai develops AI algorithms that can be plugged into a company's existing software to accelerate and automate certain tasks. That strategy sounds promising, but C3 still generates about 30% of its revenue from a joint venture with Baker Hughes\xa0that is set to expire in fiscal 2025 (which ends in April 2025)."", ""If C3 doesn't renew that deal, its revenue will drop off a cliff. It still faces stiff competition from similar AI services that are directly integrated into Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft's Azure, and other leading cloud platforms, while robotic process automation (RPA) platforms like UiPath and generative AI services like ChatGPT could disrupt its long-term growth."", ""C3's revenue rose a mere 6% in fiscal 2023, compared to its 38% growth in fiscal 2022. It's started to offer usage-based plans (as opposed to its original subscription plans) to gain more customers in this tougher macro environment, and it's rolling out new tools for generative AI platforms to stay relevant in the AI race. But those strategies will keep its bottom line in the red for the foreseeable future -- and its stock doesn't look cheap at 12 times this year's sales."", ""Palantir's data mining and analytics platform gathers information from disparate sources to help its clients make data-driven decisions. Its Gotham platform serves government customers, while its Foundry platform provides similar tools for large commercial customers. The U.S. military and most U.S. government agencies currently use Gotham to gather intelligence."", 'After its public debut in 2020, Palantir claimed it could grow its annual revenue by at least 30% through 2025. Its revenue rose 47% in 2020 and 41% in 2021, but only grew 24% in 2022. For 2023, it expects just 16% revenue growth.', ""Palantir blames that slowdown on the macro headwinds for Foundry and the uneven timing of Gotham's government contracts. However, it's also facing competition from similar data mining platforms across the commercial market as well as internally developed platforms within the U.S. government."", ""On the bright side, Palantir has stayed profitable over the past year as it reined in its spending, and it initiated a $1 billion buyback plan in August. Those strategies are responsible, but they also suggest Palantir's business is maturing -- and its stock still looks pricey at 60 times forward earnings and 14 times next year's sales."", ""SoundHound AI provides audio and speech recognition services and apps for a wide range of industries. Its flexible services are appealing to companies that want to add audio recognition services to their products without tethering themselves to a tech giant like Microsoft or Alphabet's Google."", 'SoundHound is still growing like a weed. Its revenue rose 47% in 2022 and it expects 44-57% growth in 2023. But before it went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022, it told investors it could grow its revenue by 41% in 2022 and a whopping 245% in 2023 as it scaled up its business.', ""SoundHound blamed that slowdown on the tough macro environment, but it's clearly struggling to expand its business in the shadow of larger speech recognition platforms like Microsoft's Nuance and Google Assistant. It also has customer concentration problems: More than two-thirds of its revenue came from just three customers in 2022."", ""SoundHound might look reasonably valued at eight times next year's sales, but it's still deeply unprofitable and it ended its latest quarter with a high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.6. Those glaring flaws could all set it up for a steep drop in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?', 'Before you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and C3.ai wasn't one of them.

The company is massively profiting from an uptick in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which has seen its stock climb 237% this year.', 'In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year and a 1,600% spike in operating income.

Limited growth, low margins, and unprofitable quarters sum up why this has been an underperforming stock in recent years."", ""One thing that likely still attracts investors is the dividend. At 7.2%, Walgreens' yield is incredibly high. And the company has also been increasing it for nearly 50 straight years. But could its impressive streak of dividend growth be in danger of ending this year?"", ""The big question dividend investors should be asking about Walgreens' payout is whether it's safe and sustainable. If it isn't, then there's little reason to invest in the stock for its dividend. After all, if you have no confidence in the quarterly dividend continuing, you may only end up setting yourself up for disappointment and stock losses down the road."", ""And there's a real concern that Walgreens' dividend isn't safe. Whether you're looking at cash flow or earnings, there isn't a whole lot of reason to be optimistic about the dividend. In two of the past three quarters, Walgreens has incurred an operating loss. And free cash flow has often not been strong enough to support the company's payouts. In the trailing 12 months, Walgreens' free cash flow has totaled just $141 million. That pales in comparison to the nearly $1.7 billion it has paid out in cash dividends during that stretch."", 'Even as Walgreens looks for ways to cut costs, its efforts may not be enough to support both its dividend and its goals for expanding out its healthcare business, which includes the launch of hundreds of primary care clinics across the country. Such a strategy is cash intensive and could put the dividend at risk.', 'Without a way for the company to inject some much-needed cash flow into its operations, it may only be a matter of time before Walgreens has to make a change with respect to its dividend payments.', ""This year will be a big test for the company. It will show investors whether the business is all-in on its growth plans or whether it's still going to try to focus on being a dividend growth stock. I don't believe it's going to do the latter, for multiple reasons."", ""First, the company no longer boasts about its dividend growth streak. When it announced its quarterly dividend in October, it only talked about paying a dividend for 364 consecutive quarters; there was no mention of increasing its annual dividend payments. It's a subtle omission, but dividend growth stocks are proud of their track records. And while Walgreens technically didn't increase its dividend in 2023, the total annual dividend paid was still higher than in 2022, and thus, the company could still claim that its dividend increased this past year."", ""Second, the company's cash position simply isn't strong enough. As noted, Walgreens isn't generating enough free cash flow to support both its growth and dividend for much longer, and something has to give. While it could raise its dividend by a fraction of a cent this year to keep the streak going, that only delays what looks to be the inevitable -- a dividend reduction. Barring a significant improvement in its financials in the near future, investors should brace for the reality that their payouts could be much lower in the future."", ""Third, the new CEO, Tim Wentworth, may be tempted to make a big move. With a new executive in charge, there's the opportunity to break with the old and start with a new, more defined strategy. The company can still offer a modest dividend for the sake of keeping its streak of paying dividends going, but the focus should be on long-term growth and making Walgreens a stronger business in the long run. My hope would be that with a new CEO, it's easier to start with a fresh approach."", ""Walgreens' business looks to be at a crossroads right now. And until there's clarity about its path forward, investors are better off taking a wait-and-see approach with the healthcare stock. If Walgreens clings to its dividend and remains focused on raising its payouts this year, I would avoid it like the plague."", ""But if the company slashes the dividend drastically and says the priority is growth and getting the business back to profitability, then it could make for an enticing contrarian investment (assuming you're OK with the risk)."", 'Sitting on the fence and trying to balance both paying a high dividend and focusing on growth, however, is likely to lead to underwhelming returns for the stock as neither growth nor dividend investors may feel comfortable with that approach.', ""Ultimately, I expect that not only will Walgreens not increase its dividend payments this year, but it will also cut them. It's the best move for the business in the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at TransDigm Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group ', 'According to our valuation model, TransDigm Group seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy TransDigm Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $1234.93, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that TransDigm Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. TransDigm Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 75%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead.

A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.', ""But the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period."", ""In case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies:"", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook,', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL),', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN),', 'Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX),', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.', ""The mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years."", ""But even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice."", ""The Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%."", ""That said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase."", ""Above all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips."", ""So Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap."", ""If Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in."", ""The thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal."", ""Now, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most."", ""Cash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well."", 'Until then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.', ""I'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now."", ""The company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division."", ""But the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop."", '""Wait a minute, Anders,"" I hear you say. ""Isn\'t this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.""', ""Well, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction."", ""In sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

The stock more than doubled, with a 128% gain in 52 weeks. Yet, that big jump barely made a dent in the damage Roku's shares took in 2021 and 2022. All told, share prices remain more than 80% below the all-time highs from the summer of 2021."", 'So I keep buying more Roku stock in this deep market trough. Roku is one of the clearest long-term growth stories in the market today, similar in many ways to former corporate parent Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) in 2011.', ""I can't promise that Roku's stock will return more than 4,100% over the next 12 years, as Netflix has done. Even a faded photocopy of a parody of the real thing would be enough to make serious money for Roku investors."", 'In other words, I still see Roku as a strong buy even after its recent gains. Here are the four most compelling reasons why.', '... or maybe I should say, ""a small slice of several massive target markets.""', ""There's a lot to unpack here, but I'll try to keep it brief. You have places to go and people to meet, I'm sure."", 'Roku is a leading provider of user experience platforms for streaming media services. The market itself is booming and should effectively replace old-school movie and TV solutions in the long run. The cord-cutting trend is not going away, and the final target market could work out to billions of households.', ""The company is also a major player in digital advertising. That sector is in a deep slump these days, as ad buyers are holding their wallets in an iron grip. It doesn't make sense to launch expensive marketing campaigns in an era where consumers aren't ready to buy what you're selling, right? But someday, the digital ad market should rekindle its stalled growth. This global market was worth $627 billion in 2023 and should reach $836 billion by 2026, with Roku possibly capturing a larger slice of that pie."", ""This hungry innovator wants more opportunity than these two key sectors can provide. Hence, Roku has also entered the content creation industry and its own brand of smart TV sets. And it wouldn't surprise me to see other connections to media-adjacent markets in 2024 and beyond."", ""By the end of 2020, with the unique coronavirus lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Roku sported 51.2 million active user accounts. The average revenue per user (ARPU) stood at $28.76 per year. Roku's stock plunge started soon thereafter, as bearish investors wrote the company off as a spent COVID-19 play with no future."", ""When the inflation crisis started later that year, Roku held its pricing steady while many competitors passed their rising costs on to their users. Together with continued innovations and Roku's entry into original content productions, the steady pricing kept the fires burning under the company's user growth. In November's Q3 2023 report, the user count rose by 48% to 75.8 million names. The annual ARPU jumped 43% higher over the same period, landing at $41.03."", ""Yes, Roku's bottom-line profits have been negative for a while. However, the company is building a massive user base from which it can explore profit-oriented strategies in the future. That's another lesson learned from Netflix's decades of evolving financial strategies."", 'The headline numbers can look scary, but the worst bits are more accounting acrobatics than real cash costs.', ""Roku's cash balance has doubled since the end of 2020, and the positive cash flows continue today. The user count is soaring, free cash flows came in at 9.6% of revenues in the first three quarters of 2023, and Roku has paid off the last of its long-term debt papers."", 'This is not a struggling business gasping for air, despite a recent round of layoffs and impairment charges. The company is reshaping its business plan to include more in-house content production, and those earnings-sapping impairment charges largely came from dropping third-party content licenses earlier than expected.', ""I'm talking about the video-streaming pioneer's successes, as well as its mistakes."", 'Roku CEO and founder Anthony Wood is a serial entrepreneur. The company name means ""six"" in Japanese, because it was the sixth business Wood started. Roku\'s history as a stand-alone business started when Netflix decided to cut its streaming player hardware operations loose from the rest of the company, encouraging a stronger partner network. With an in-house media player, Netflix would essentially compete with other consumer electronics firms, possibly pushing them away from building Netflix into their own products.', ""The focus on partnership continues in Roku's separate era. These days, the consumer goods specialists are the company's natural rivals in many ways, but Roku still sells streaming-platform software to many of them. Furthermore, every streaming service worth its salt needs to support the Roku system, because the company dominates the global market with a 51% share of all connected TV devices."", ""But wait -- there's more to know about Roku's Netflix connections."", ""The company's board of directors holds a seat for Neil Hunt, Netflix's chief product officer from 1999 to 2017. That lengthy span included Netflix's entire DVD-mailing triumph, the silly Qwikster debacle, the digital media launch, and its early years in the content creation business."", ""Hunt was more than a fly on the wall in Netflix's formative years. You can bet that he is bringing that experience into Roku's boardroom on the regular. Remember, that's where the company builds and support its long-term business strategy. Whatever inside baseball Neil Hunt knows from his Netflix career should serve Roku well as it executes a similar growth strategy."", ""And you can do far worse than ripping pages from Netflix's market-beating playbook for long-term growth. Again, even a poor impression of that masterful role model should result in a fantastic business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Roku wasn't one of them.

That is the conclusion reached by Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese, after scanning the results of a streaming-focused survey commissioned from Momentive to keep an eye on the trends seen in 4Q23 and into 1Q24.', 'Specifically related to the US market, Reese notes several takeaways from the survey: “1) total subscribers appears to have ticked marginally higher in the quarter, 2) the proportion of subscribers on the ad-supported tier appears to have ticked marginally higher in the quarter, 3) new and returning subscribers are more likely to opt for the ad-supported tier in Q1:24, and 4) Netflix continues to benefit from former account-sharers, at least 15% of whom opted to pay more for the extra-member feature post-crackdown, resulting in higher ARPU.”', 'Reese’s positive thesis for Netflix relied in part on the enforcement of measures against password sharing, which should result in an increase in both a) total subscribers and b) average revenue per user (ARPU). Recent results and the survey’s findings support that view for Q4. “We expect further growth in the coming quarters,” says Reese, “which should drive free cash flow expansion as Netflix keeps costs in check.”', 'In fact, looking at the overall picture, due to Reese’s belief Netflix can generate much more free cash flow than its guidance implies, Netflix keeps its place on Wedbush’s Best Ideas List.', 'Based on a potent combination of global content creation, balancing costs and increasing profitability, Reese makes the case the streaming giant has “reached the right formula.” Cash generation is set to get a further boost from the crackdown on password sharing and from its ad-supported tier.', 'And in a murky environment where competitors have yet to put together a coherent strategy, Reese sees Netflix as well-positioned to capitalize. As such, Reese believes Netflix should be valued as “an immensely profitable, slow-growth company.”', 'So, what does this all ultimately mean for investors? Reese maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on Netflix shares, alongside a $525 price target, suggesting shares will climb ~8% higher in the year ahead.', 'Looking at the consensus breakdown, 23 other analysts join Reese in the bull camp and with an additional 11 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, the $471.93 average price target implies shares are slightly overvalued.

Netflix says you may be entitled to compensation. Motley Fool Money starts now. A little bit of news to get through and joining us to do that is Nick Sciple. Nick, good to see you.', 'Nick Sciple: Yeah. Great to be here with you Ricky.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Deidre likes doing M&A Mondays, but we got another pretty major acquisition going on to start us off on Tuesday. Occidental Petroleum, which engages in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, has agreed to buy CrownRock, a private energy producer, for $12 billion. Break this down. Why does Occidental want to buy CrownRock?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, this continue as a wave of really consolidation in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the Permian Basin, the shale patch in the US over the past year. Lots of folks recognizing that they've maybe used some of their best drilling inventory, looking to secure inventory for the long term. Occidental is one of those companies. These assets that they're acquiring from CrownRock are complementary to its existing portfolio in the Permian Basin. Gives them access to additional inventory in a basin that's starting to reach maturity is going to make them one of the largest producers in the Permian. Also, CEO Vicki Hollub has said it's going to give them the ability to weather downturns in a more robust way because CrownRocks wells have a little bit lower decline rates than that from what you see in their core portfolio. So to position them to be able to withstand a little bit different environments. Also worth noting here, looking at Occidental, the way they're structuring this deal using $10 billion in debt. A lot more aggressive than some of the other deals you've seen out there in the market. For example, Exxon went out there and bought Pioneer, used all stock in its transactions. So it continues the trend we've seen in the industry. But maybe a little bit more aggressive, which isn't out of the ordinary for Occidental. If you remember back to their acquisition of Anadarko just a few years ago."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, there's a little bit of oddness with the deal where they're taking out a lot of debt to do it. They're also simultaneously boosting their dividend and selling off other assets, which I think has raised some question marks among investors."", ""Nick Sciple: It'll be interesting to see what happens with those divestments. I think the number was 4.5 to $6 billion in divestments which they'll use to pay down some of that debt they're taking on to acquire CrownRock. Seeing where they sell off assets maybe tells you about the future of the business. Clearly, some attraction to the Permian Basin, maybe some other areas. The emphasize going forward."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, let's focus on the Permian Basin for a second. It's a massive oil fields primarily in West Texas. I think it goes out to New Mexico a little bit. ExxonMobil, purchasing Pioneer, natural resources to get a little bit more of a stake in that ground. Talk about the area, why is there such a rush for producers to get space in this area? It's been well-known for a while that there's a lot of oil in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin."", ""Nick Sciple: I think it's a few things going on to, you mentioned the Permian Basin, the largest, most developed basin in the US. Among the lowest breakevens on the market. Makes it attractive for that reason. Also, as I mentioned earlier, some of the best acreage in the Permian Basin has been drilled. We're at the point where the basin is maturing. US oil production is at all time highs, but it's really only getting back to where we were in 2019. As some of these larger producers are looking to secure inventory for the long term, that makes the Permian attractive. Also, these folks have a lot of cash compared to where they were a couple years ago during the pandemic. Had a couple strong years. So you have some strong balance sheets, a position to go gobble up some of these assets at the same time oil prices are down, 20 percent or so in the past several months, maybe that positions some of these sellers to be a little bit more willing to bid up. So a lot of things going on at once that I think make for a robust deal environment."", 'Ricky Mulvey: So Warren Buffett has a large stake in Occidental Petroleum. He seems to have blessed this deal. There was a private jet visiting Omaha that captured some market commentators attention. The broader market is a little bit more skeptical. I think Occidental trading a little bit down on this news, so. So what do you think the disconnect here is between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Market?', ""Nick Sciple: Yeah, I think it's really this divergence you see in the markets in general. This divergence between what's going on in the near term and then expectations for the long term. In the near term as I mentioned, we've really seen oil prices fall significantly over 20 percent in the past several months. Concerns about weak demand in China, concerns that maybe these OPEC cuts that we've seen won't be as sticky as the market hopes. But long term, these inventory dynamics I talked about in the Permian continue to play out as we've used some of the best, some of the best rockets. In order to maintain these levels of production that we're seeing today, you're going to need to see some of this consolidation take place. I think near term, some skepticism about oil prices. I think the supply demand picture a lot more robust long term, more attractive looking long term. I think that's what these acquirers are seeing."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. Let's move on to the next story. Disney and Netflix have agreed to a short-term domestic content agreement. Netflix is going to get to Stream 14 Library shows on a non-exclusive basis. Those include Grey's Anatomy, This is Us, and ESPN's 30 for 30 Library. Nick, this is a big deal, but what is the signal to you?"", ""Nick Sciple: I think this continues a trend of lots of folks in the entertainment landscape that had positioned themselves to maybe compete directly with Netflix now saying we can't compete with Netflix in the way that we had hoped. Challenges to Disney's maybe core cable business makes licensing this content to Netflix a little bit more attractive. You've seen that from other folks out there in the industry as well. When I think about this isn't the best Disney content out there. They're not putting Star Wars and Marvel, they're putting Grey's Anatomy and 30 for 30. But I think that this content is more, I guess, punches above its weight on Netflix platform than it does on some of these other platforms. The analogy I keep thinking about with this is like Netflix is like TV. Do you ever remember back in the days of cable when there'd be some movie on TV? Like, the classic Con Air, Nicholas Cage's movie. That's not a movie you would ever seek out to watch, but if it's on TV you might. I think Netflix is in that dynamic as well, where I don't think a lot of folks sought out suits when it was on other streaming platforms, but they watched it in droves on Netflix. Netflix is profitable. They're actually able to pay up for some of this content, and folks actually watched it on their platform, whereas they might get lost in some other streaming platform. I think it's a sign of Netflix's strength and they've kind of won the streaming war."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Unlike some other companies, Disney has been very careful to say the core properties are not going there. I think it's, to your point, it's a win for both companies. Because Disney gets to say, hey, we're not going to give you the Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars stuff, and Netflix, honestly, maybe they don't care because it's the shows that you can have on the background. Maybe in ESPN, 30 for 30 that you've watched a few other times. Back in June, Netflix made a licensing deal with Warner Brothers Discovery. It was about six months after David Zaslav asked his team to shut down deals between them and Netflix because he didn't like. It was like some certain deal that they had with the show Sandman. Now that's why you're seeing DC movies on Netflix as well as some HBO series on there. How did Netflix get into this position of strength? Why is Netflix in a position to be a buyer right now?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, I think Netflix is profitable in streaming in a way that many of these other folks aren't. They've been able to achieve scale and cash flow that other folks aren't able to achieve in streaming. Another thing that I think is worth noting, as well as Netflix doesn't have a legacy business to protect or legacy debt to support in the way that the Warner Brothers Discovery does. So Netflix's streaming business is profitable, gives them the ability to go buy up some of some of this content and these other companies frankly need it because of their financial situation."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, for Netflix, one thing I found interesting about them, and I think this deal shows it, is they spend a ton of money buying these long-running sitcoms and they've had very little success making them. They're happy to spend so much money on. For a while, it was the office. Now it's going to be Grey's Anatomy, and This Is Us. They don't make the stuff that they spend lots of money buying, they'd rather pay for the hits."", ""Nick Sciple: Yeah. I think the media business is an inherently an uncertain one when you're making content that does not yet have an audience out there. It's a lot easier to do that calculus for, licensed content that has an existing audience in place. I think if I am Netflix and I have the ability to pay a reasonable price for this content that has already made and already has an existing audience. I think that's a lot more attractive bet than trying to come up with a new property from zero. I think even Netflix's management has said, they're going to slow down a little bit on original production. Part of that is because they have access to license content in a way they maybe didn't expect to have a few years ago when competition was more intense."", ""Ricky Mulvey: A lot of traveling coming up for the holidays. People ask you for stock rec, sometimes, I'm not going to do that. You got any Netflix recs as we get to traveling for the holidays?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, on the topic of long-running sitcoms that Netflix didn't produce, I like to just play the hits, Seinfeld's on Netflix these days. I spend a lot of time watching that. That's one for me. If you want something new, I'm into the cult shows Escaping Twin Flames. Kept me glued to the couch for a few hours. Maybe check that one out as well if you're in cults and their craziness."", 'Ricky Mulvey: I asked you for a TV wreck and you had Seinfeld is number one and it is 2023 disciple. That\'s right. I\'ll throw out, if you like the docu-series, there\'s one that\'s excellent. Well, there\'s one I\'m going to recommend after we record, but I don\'t want to recommend it on a wide-scale basis. MerPeople is phenomenal. It is the subculture of people who are mermaids. It is a three-part documentary series. It is honestly, it is one of the strongest stories that has hooked me in, where a mermaid in Arkansas has to go on the hero\'s journey so she can live out her dream. Shout Out Sparkles. As we move to our next story. Alphabet versus Epic, the video game maker Epic seems to have a major win. They\'re known for making Fortnight. A jury in Northern California said that Google basically has monopoly power over the Android app market. Google did anti-competitive things, and moreover, Epic was hurt by those practices. Google shareholders really don\'t seem to mind. You\'ve also got a Bloomberg headlining saying, ""This decision could upend the mobile app economy"". Nick Sciple. What say you?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, certainly always worth paying attention to whenever Google loses an antitrust case, has been long debated whether those App Store fees, I think it's 15 percent on the baseline that Google and Apple charge, aren't monopoly profits. We finally have a jury that has made that ruling. Now, are we going to upend the mobile app economy? We'll see the Court still needs to determine the appropriate remedies to take. They're going to hold a hearing in January to decide what steps to take to fix this anti-competitive industry. But whatever choices that Court makes could lead the way we go about buying apps and consuming them different in the future than it has been today. Certainly could mean that the money that Google and Apple are able to achieve from those app stores smaller in the future."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One of the crux of it seems to be that Epic wanted to make their own app store within Google, which technically Google allows, of course. Or the Epic complaint is essentially put up this warning screen, like if you download this app store, you're opening yourself up to all these viruses, that sort of thing and that may have been anti-competitive. But what do you think the implications are if software developers can go on these platforms, Google and Apple, and make their own app stores? I would say this outcome seems unlikely, but not impossible."", ""Nick Sciple: It certainly would be gravity for the amount of fees that Google and Apple are able to charge for folks to transact through the App Store. It would be in the interest of consumers to save a little bit of money by doing things that way. I think to the extent you see those royalties fall for Google and Apple than folks who sell via those app stores, that presumably would fall to the bottom line for a company like Match Group or Spotify or other it's out there in the market. So a shrinking profit pool for some of these big companies could open up additional profits for other businesses. You think about a company like Valve with Steam. Steam is really a dominant app purchase platform. And you think about games online. Could all of a sudden Steam compete more directly with Google and Apple when it comes to the games ecosystem? Something like that could be interesting."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We're not the only ones watching this story. I'm sure the C suite of Apple has checked out the headline this morning. How do you think Apple's taking this news?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, you recall Apple was able to prevail over App, at least a judge was able to rule in their favor. Didn't get to a jury trial. To the extent this ruling sticks, again, this is a meaningful threat to Apple's App store, which gives them an advantage over others in the, in the Apple ecosystem. So I think if I'm Apple, I would be worried. But we'll see what the court does next. What remedies they choose, how much that will impact the future for Apple."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Nick Sciple, thank you for your time and your insight. I'll see you later this week. Looking forward to it."", ""Nick Sciple: Looking forward to seeing you in DC for Foolapalooza. It's been a long time. Excited to get back."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Coming up on the end of the year, and one thing we get is a lot of people trying to improve their financial situation as they begin the New Year.

We're also going to be recording a mail bag with Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick next week. If you have personal finance questions for them, that's a great place to do it. Up next, Mark Kantrowitz is a nationally recognized expert on student financial aid, scholarships, and college savings plans. He's also the author of five books, including How to appeal for more college financial aid. Robert Brokamp spoke with Kantrowitz about recent changes to the financial application process. Who's going to get more aid and who will end up actually paying more?"", ""Robert Brokamp: The free application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA, is usually available on October 1, but it's been delayed this year while the Department of Education makes significant changes to the form and how aid is determined. So Mark what are some of the biggest differences between the old FAFSA, the new FAFSA, which supposedly will be available sometime on or before December 31st."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: The new FAFSA is much shorter and simpler than the old FAFSA. They got rid of about two thirds of the questions. Can't say the exact number, because a lot depends on the particular circumstances of the student and their family. But on average we're going to see one third as many questions. Which means instead of taking an hour, it might take 15, 20 minutes for people to complete the form. That's one big change. Another change is that it will become easier for students to qualify for the Pell Grant. There will be more financial aid for low income students, but there are several changes that make it harder for middle and high income students to qualify for aid. For example, they get rid of the sibling loophole, which divided the parent contribution by the number of children in college. So a parent who had $100,000 of income was approximately the same as a parent who has $50,000 in income if the parent with a six figure income had twice as many children in college at the same time. They're also getting rid of the small business exclusion. Small businesses will count as an asset and the family farm exclusion. Now, a more recent problem, FAFSA includes a whole bunch of different tables of numbers that are supposed to be adjusted for inflation. An example is the income protection allowance shelters a portion of the family income. There's also an income protection allowance for the student income. The US Department of Education is not doing that inflation adjustment, even though it's required by law this year. They will do it for the 2025, 26 FAFSA. But they're saying that the timeline is too tight and it's too complicated for them to do right now, so they'll need to hunt on it for this year. But that means that the typical student is going to qualify for thousands of dollars less financial aid then they're entitled to. I don't think that's right."", ""Robert Brokamp: Yeah, I saw you quoted in a CNBC article about this. Do you think this is something that if there's enough of an uproar about it that they will change or is it really just too late?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, it may be too late because they're already seem to be running right up against the deadline. So the due date for the FAFSA, as you noted, is going to be December 31st instead of October 1st. That's not that big a deal, and if you go back eight years, the FAFSA had to start date of January 1st. It wasn't ideal, but the switch to October 1st was an improvement. But it's not just that students will only be able to start submitting the FAFSA on December 31st. It's also the colleges are not going to get a copy of the students FAFSA information until late January. That pushes the schedule for getting financial aid award offers to the students back significantly. I wouldn't be surprised if college financial aid offers are made in late March or early April as opposed to early March. Because of this, if the colleges squeeze the schedule as much as they can, who knows what problems there may be with this FAFSA, there hasn't been any public beta testing of it. So there could be a lot of glitches when it first launches."", 'Robert Brokamp: Wow. People, be prepared to be patient and maybe be delayed on getting your aid package.', 'Mark Kantrowitz: Yes.', ""Robert Brokamp: Let's talk about a couple other changes that I believe are coming. One is the change in the way the FAFSA handles divorced parents. What's going to be different about."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: So when the parents are divorced or separated or never married. If they live together, they're treated as though they're married. But if they live apart, then only one parent is responsible for completing the FAFSA. This used to be the parent with whom the child lived the most. But starting with the 2024, 25, it'll be the parent who provided the most financial support to the student in the 12 months ending on the date the FAFSA is filed. Now if the parents provide an equal amount of financial support, then it'll be whichever parent has a greater income, counting the income of any step-parents, that gives the parents an incentive to make sure that it's a parent with a lower income who provides more support so that the student will qualify for more financial aid."", ""Robert Brokamp: Another change is grandparents owned 529, a lot of grandparents, they opened 529 for their grand-kids in the past form the assets were not included on the FAFSA but distributions from those 529 were counted as untaxed income. But as I understand it, that's going away so that it's almost like the FAFSA doesn't know anything about any grandparent 529."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: There used to be a question on the FAFSA called the cash support question, which is where you would report untaxed income to the student. There was no similar question for parents. That question has been eliminated and that's where you would report distributions from grandparent on 529 plans and also gifts to the student from grandparents, aunts and uncles. And it's not just grandparents, it's anybody other than the student or the student's custodial parent. So the treatment for a custodial five to nine plans that are owned by the student or the five to nine plan that is owned by a dependent student's parent, that hasn't changed, those are still reported as parent assets on the FAFSA. There is one slight change which is if the parent owns a five to nine plan, not just for the student but for the student's siblings, the five to nine plans for the student's siblings are not going to be reported on the FAFSA so that will yield an improvement. So you're not counting your brother or sisters as five to nine plan against your aid eligibility. So there's a couple of changes here and the change in the treatment of 5-9 plans owned by the grandparent, aunts, uncles, or anybody other than the student or parent, that is a significant positive change in that it makes those 5-9 plans disappear. They aren't reported as an asset and distribution. Qualified distributions aren't counted as untaxed income on the FAFSA. Now, if you make a non-qualified distribution, that is going to show up in your adjusted gross income and that will affect your financial aid eligibility. But so long as you use the 5-9 plans the way they were intended if it's owned by a grandparent, it has no impact."", ""Robert Brokamp: So putting it all together who's going to benefit the most from these changes and who's eligibility for aid is actually going to be reduced due to these changes?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, there are a bunch of cross currents. So generally low income students will get more aid. The Pell Grant formula has a new secondary formula on top of the existing formula. The secondary formula compares the family income to two thresholds based on a multiple other poverty line. So if your parent's income is less than 175% of the poverty line, you're going to get the maximum Pell Grant regardless of what the primary formula says, and if the income is less than another threshold, which depends on whether a single parent household or a two-parent household. But if you are under that threshold, you're going to get at least a minimum Pell Grant. These changes mean that more than 500,000 additional students will qualify for a Pell Grant and of all the students who qualify for a Pell Grant, an additional 1.5 million of them will qualify for the maximum Pell Grant. There will be more grant money being awarded to low-income students. More of them are going to qualify and more of them are going to get the maximum grant. That means low-income students are generally going to benefit significantly from the new form. Middle and high-income families may have a decrease in their aid eligibility. It used to be that families with six-figure incomes could nevertheless qualify for a Pell Grant. If they had multiple children in college at the same time, that's no longer going to be there. They won't qualify many of them for the Pell Grant. Now the change with regard to grandparent-owned 5-9 plans, that's going to be a benefit, especially when the grandparents are wealthy but the family is not, it's hard to predict any individual have a generality that says, oh, all these students are not going to get more aid or to get less aid. And these aren't, but we have these general trends. Low-income students get more financial aid, middle and high-income students get less financial aid."", 'Robert Brokamp: It definitely seems to me like if you have kids in college, like I do now, I have three kids in college. You pay a certain amount this year based on how you filled out the face. There could be a significant difference for next year if you have multiple kids or if you own that farm or if you own that business.', ""Mark Kantrowitz: Yes, definitely. Necessarily from the federal government or the state government, but maybe from the colleges themselves. You will get less financial aid because of that change in the student name index, which is the new name for the EFC. Now I would recommend appealing to the college. Point out that last year you got a certain amount of financial aid, and this year you're getting much less, even though your income hasn't changed. Now what I think some colleges may do is try to hold the family harmless if you're a returning student. If you're a brand new student, you might not get any adjustments. But the colleges are concerned about the potential shock to the family finances from if they have like three kids in college at the same time. And each of them gets $3,000 less financial aid, that's perhaps as much as $10,000 less aid. And it'll vary significantly from one family to the next in terms of the impact that may make it very difficult for the family to afford that college education."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

The S&P 500 was up about 25%, closing near its all-time high.', 'However, not all stocks joined that rally. Utilities, in particular, were under pressure last year due to the impact of higher interest rates and some company-specific issues. Those headwinds could fade in 2024. Because of that, utilities could have the power to produce strong total returns. Black Hills\xa0(NYSE: BKH), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) currently stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as stocks that could get off to a strong start in the new year.', ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Black Hills): The first thing that dividend investors will be attracted to at Black Hills is its status as a Dividend King, with 53 years of annual dividend increases under its belt. The next key feature is the 4.6% dividend yield, which is toward the high end of the stock's yield range over the past decade. This suggests it is a historically good time to buy this regulated utility."", ""One of the big reasons for the high yield is the rise in interest rates over the past year or so, which has made other income options, like CDs, more competitive. Rising rates have also increased the utility's interest expense, though it has been working to reduce debt to offset the impact. Debt reduction, however, has required a reduction in capital investment, which slows near-term growth. But given the long history of dividend reliability here, this is likely to be a temporary headwind for investors who think in decades."", ""Notably, Black Hills' regulated business has monopolies in regions where its customer count is growing at nearly 3 times as fast as average U.S. population growth. In other words, once the natural gas and electric utility gets its balance sheet back in shape, it will have to increase spending back to previous levels just to keep up with demand. And that means there's no reason to expect dividend growth to come to an end anytime soon. But if you don't act now you could end up missing the opportunity."", ""Matt DiLallo (Enbridge): Enbridge shares fell about 9% in 2023. The main factor weighing on its stock was the pipeline and utility company's decision to acquire three natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy. The market didn't like the deal because it's such a large undertaking."", 'However, Enbridge believes the $14 billion transaction will be a needle-mover. CEO Greg Ebel commented on the deal, saying that ""adding natural gas utilities of this scale and quality, at a historically attractive multiple, is a once-in-a-generation opportunity."" The company believes the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings and cash flow within the first year while enhancing its long-term growth profile. ', 'The market is taking a more wait-and-see approach to the transaction. Its initial skepticism is enabling investors to buy shares of Enbridge at a cheaper price (8.5 times 2024 cash flow per share) and higher dividend yield (currently 7.5%). That discount might not be around for too long. Shares should bounce back as investors grow more comfortable with the transaction. ', ""That eventual recovery sets investors up to potentially earn very strong returns. Enbridge expects to grow its earnings at a 5% annual rate over the medium term, driven by contract rate increases, its massive backlog of expansion projects, and bolt-on acquisitions. Add that earnings growth to Enbridge's high-yielding and steadily rising dividend (it gave investors a 3.1% raise for 2024, its 29th straight year of dividend growth), and the company has the fuel to produce an average annual total return in the double digits. Meanwhile, there's further upside as its share price recovers. That's a very strong total return potential for such a low-risk stock. "", ""Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): 2023 was a bummer year for NextEra Energy stock, with higher interest rates proving to be a major growth hurdle for the renewable energy giant. Dividend stocks were already taking a hit amid rising interest rates when NextEra Energy's limited partnership company, NextEra Energy Partners unexpectedly slashed its dividend growth targets citing difficulty in accessing low-cost funds in the current interest rate environment."", ""Investors feared NextEra Energy would follow suit and reduce its dividend growth, too, especially since a dividend cut at the partnership will also mean a fall in extra income for the parent company. Also, since NextEra Energy typically dropped down its assets to NextEra Energy Partners to raise funds for growth, a shift in the partnership's strategy to not pursue acquisitions in the near term could make it harder for the parent company to access capital. These fears pummeled NextEra Energy stock."", ""NextEra Energy, however, has tried to dispel investors' fears since and has stuck with its growth plans. It still expects to grow its annual adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 6% to 8% through 2026 off its 2024 estimate and is confident of increasing its dividend by around 10% in 2024, driven by its capital deployment program and a strong balance sheet. NextEra Energy plans to invest $32 billion to $34 billion in its electric utility, Florida Power & Light, between 2022 and 2025, and has a backlog of more than 21 gigawatts at its clean energy arm, Energy Resources."", ""The biggest factor that could propel NextEra Energy stock higher, though, is a change in the Federal Reserve's stance. With the Fed now even expected to cut rates in the coming year, NextEra Energy stock could be an interesting turnaround story for 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Enbridge wasn't one of them.

Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Patterson Companies' exceptional 28% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Patterson Companies' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.5% in the same period, which is great to see."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', 'Patterson Companies has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 51%, meaning the company only retains 49% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.', ""Besides, Patterson Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we feel that Patterson Companies' performance has been quite good.

Spot gold is up 13.6% while silver has gained 1.4% YTD, with much of gold’s rally coming in the final quarter of the year after the Fed turned more dovish and even signaled a possibility of three interest rate cuts in 2024. The gold rally has coincided with a steep fall in interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury declining from 4.98% in mid-October to 3.84% currently.', 'That said, platinum group metals (PGM) have not been as lucky, with platinum’s nearly 7% down to $998.70 per ounce while palladium has suffered an even worse fate after cratering nearly 36% YTD to $1,1160.50 per ounce.', 'Base Metals', '3-month\xa0COMEX copper, LME copper and tin futures three-month have all posted slight gains in the current year; however, prices of other key base metals including aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead have all declined.', 'Key battery metals have had a year to forget. After peaking at an all-time high of nearly CNY 600,000 ($84,015) per tonne in November 2022, lithium carbonate prices have crashed to CNY 97,500 ($13,650) per tonne thanks mainly to a global oversupply. The lithium price crash has been so shocking that a Wall Street analyst has predicted the markets could swing in the opposite direction and\xa0\xa0usher in a lithium shortage\xa0as early as 2025.', 'The same goes for another critical battery metal, nickel, with prices cut nearly in half thanks, again, to supply outpacing demand. The nickel market is facing a supply-demand surplus of 239,000 tonnes, the\xa0largest surplus in at least a decade, the International Nickel Study Group (INSG) has reported. That’s way higher than the group’s last forecast whereby it predicted the surplus will clock in at 171,000 tonnes in the current year.', 'Grains and Soft Commodities', 'The grains markets have not fared any better, with oat futures being the only grain contract to finish in the green after posting a small 1.2% gain. Soybeans and its associated products and wheat have posted double-digit declines with corn falling the most after plunging nearly 30% in the year-to-date. Meanwhile, lean hog futures have declined 21% YTD while feeder cattle futures have pulled back nearly 20% from the September peak due to an influx of supply.', 'The wide pullback has come after grain prices soared in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But here's an ironic twist: On probably wouldn't exist without Nike."", 'Olivier Bernhard, a former Swiss Ironman champion and Nike athlete, originally pitched his design for a proprietary ""cloud"" shoe cushioning technology to Nike. These cushions, which were developed by studying the flexibility of garden hoses, would relax when a runner\'s foot was in the air but tighten up for a firmer foundation when it hit the ground.', 'After Nike rejected that idea, Bernhard partnered with David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti to sell its ""CloudTec"" shoes through a newly created company called On in 2010. On subsequently became the top footwear brand in Switzerland, gained a mid-single-digit share of the U.S. footwear market, and expanded into China in 2018.', ""On went public at $24 per share on Sept. 15, 2021, and its stock hit a record high of $51.45 just two months later before dropping back to about $28. That was a wild ride, but Nike's stock has declined more than 30% since On's first trading day. Let's see why On stayed ahead of Nike over the past two years -- and if it's still the better long-term play."", ""On's revenue rose 59% in 2020, 70% in 2021, and 69% in 2022. It continued growing throughout the pandemic, as it sold more products online to offset the temporary closures of brick-and-mortar stores. Its growth was driven by a disciplined focus on full-price sales, the rollout of new premium shoes, the expansion of its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (36% of its 2022 sales), and its expansion beyond Switzerland into more international markets."", 'On expects its revenue to rise another 46% to 1.79 billion Swiss francs ($2.1 billion) for 2023. That would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% from 2019.', 'On aims to ""at least"" double its annual revenue to 3.55 billion Swiss francs ($4.2 billion) in fiscal 2026, which would represent a CAGR of 26% over the next three years. UBS\xa0recently predicted On could grow at a CAGR of 45% over the next five years as it launches new products and expands into more overseas markets.', ""On wasn't profitable at the time of its IPO, but it turned profitable in 2022. Analysts expect its net profit to grow at a CAGR of 66% from 2022 to 2025. Its gross margin rose from 54% in 2020 to 56% in 2022, and it expects that figure to exceed 59% in 2023 as it exercises its pricing power and expands its higher-margin DTC business. Over the long term, it expects its gross margin to exceed 60%."", ""Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at three times next year's sales and 39 times forward earnings. Therefore, On's big pullback certainly seems like a buying opportunity for growth-oriented investors."", ""Nike's revenue fell 4% in fiscal 2020 (which ended in May 2020) as the pandemic shut down its wholesale and first-party stores. In fiscal 2021, its revenue rose 19% as the pandemic passed and it expanded its Nike Direct DTC business."", ""But in fiscal 2022, Nike's revenue grew a mere 5% as it grappled with new COVID lockdowns in China, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary headwinds for consumer spending. In fiscal 2023, its revenue rose 10% as its business stabilized. That stabilization was led by the 14% growth of its DTC business, which accounted for 42% of its top line."", 'However, a lot of that growth was driven by steep markdowns. That pressure, along with higher logistics costs and currency headwinds, reduced its gross margin by 250 basis points to 43.5% in fiscal 2023. Its gross margin slightly recovered to 44.4% in the first half of fiscal 2024, but its revenue rose only 1% year over year.', 'Nike warned investors that its revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 could be even ""softer,"" but analysts still expect 1% growth for the full year as its tighter spending lifts its earnings per share by 12%. That slower sales growth suggests that Nike could be struggling to keep up with faster-growing competitors like On.', ""From fiscal 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Nike's revenue and net income to grow at a CAGR of 6% and 13%, respectively. However, its stock doesn't look cheap at 29 times forward earnings and three times next year's sales."", ""On is a still a tiny newcomer compared to Nike, but its stronger revenue growth, higher gross margins, and disciplined expansion into the premium footwear market should make it a more compelling play for growth-oriented investors. On also trades at comparable valuations to Nike but has a lot more runway ahead -- so it's definitely the better buy right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nike wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

But a number of factors led to a sobering reality: The process of converting the nation’s vehicles to electric power was going to be a much longer one.', 'Sure, research firm Kelley Blue Book reported that US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, with EV market share hitting 7.9% — its highest-ever level. But that growth rate is slowing, and seems to be headed to a 10% rate where it might remain for some time. Though places like California are seeing 20% adoption rates, in other states the rate is barely registering.', ""A combination of factors like high prices for EVs, higher finance costs, and infrastructure issues dimmed prospects for an EV transformation in America, though there's still reason for some optimism in 2024."", 'Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley, one of the biggest evangelists for EVs among legacy automaker execs, warned things needed change. “A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore.

Currently the tax credit is received after a buyer files their tax return the following year, however those rules are changing, allowing for a “point of sale” credit where a buyer can transfer the credit to the dealer immediately, lowering the price of the EV at purchase time.', 'That could be a big boon to price-conscious buyers. But as we know, when the government gives, it can sometimes take away. And that will be the case in 2024 when more stringent battery component sourcing rules come into play. Some cars like the Tesla Model 3 and Ford Mustang Mach-E will lose the credit temporarily as automakers adjust their supply chains for more domestic battery parts.', 'Nonetheless, cheaper EVs are coming, and regardless of tax credit status that will help overall EV sales in new year.', ""“I think you're going to see [EVs] pushing into that [pricing] midrange … so now as we start to push in, keep an eye on GM's Equinox, right?

Such companies consistently grow their profits year after year and elect to return those higher profits to shareholders.', ""A business that's able to do that likely has a lot of the characteristics Buffett looks for in a company. And when those stocks trade at a fair value, they can provide exceptional returns for shareholders."", ""Dividend growers and initiators generated an average return of 10.24% in the 50 years from 1973 through 2022, according to research from Hartford Funds. By comparison, non-payers grew just 3.95%. That might help explain Buffett's uncanny performance as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), substantially outperforming the S&P 500 index in that same period."", ""The great news is that you can copy Buffett's strategy. Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio is publicly available thanks to required Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures. Here are three dividend growth stocks in the portfolio you can buy now and hold forever."", ""Buffett first bought shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, and it's grown to become Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding by far."", ""It's easy to see why Buffett is a fan of Apple and its dividend. The iPhone is a cash-generating machine. Apple's dominance of the premium smartphone space is unlikely to change anytime soon, and its ability to generate more and more revenue from each user over time through its growing services business is fueling its bottom-line growth."", 'Apple has a generous capital return program. It reinstated its dividend in 2012 after suspending it in the mid-1990s. It has since raised its dividend every year.', 'More impressive, however, is its share repurchase program. The company has bought back over $600 billion worth of its own shares over the last decade. That has supported strong earnings-per-share growth and given investors confidence in the stock price.', 'Management intends to reach net cash neutral over time, where the cash on its balance sheet equals the amount of debt it holds. It currently holds net cash of about $45 billion. On top of that, it now generates around $100 billion in free cash flow annually. So, there are likely to be a lot more dividend increases in the future as Apple aims to return most of its cash to shareholders.', 'The stock currently trades at a premium price of around 32 times forward earnings estimates. But given its massive share repurchase plan and substantial net cash position, it deserves to trade at a premium. Despite the high price, dividend growth investors should consider shares of Apple for their portfolio.', ""Buffett has held shares of Visa (NYSE: V) in Berkshire's portfolio for over a decade. Not only has the stock outperformed the market in that time, but Visa has also raised its dividend every year since."", 'Visa benefits from a classic competitive advantage -- a big focus for Buffett in his analysis of a business. The payment network is the largest in the world, making it a top choice for banks looking to issue a new credit card, especially one accepted internationally.', 'The only other network that comes close is Mastercard, another Berkshire holding. A company trying to build a payments network from scratch will take years, maybe decades, to come close to the reach of Visa or Mastercard.', ""The ongoing shift away from cash and toward digital payments is a major boon for Visa. Since it's already done the hard work of setting up the payment network, the pennies Visa takes from each extra dollar transacting on its rails practically go straight to its bottom line."", 'Management returns almost all of its growing free cash flow to investors through its dividend and share repurchase program. And the capital return program still leans heavily toward buying back shares. The board recently authorized $25 billion in multiyear share repurchases. By comparison, it paid just $3.75 billion in dividends last year.', ""But with nearly $20 billion in annual free cash flow, there's plenty of room to increase the dividend, just as it's done each year since going public in 2008. The shares currently trade for a forward P/E of just 26, a discount to its historical valuation as well as its smaller rival Mastercard (which trades for about 30 times forward earnings)."", ""T-Mobile U.S. (NASDAQ: TMUS) is a relatively recent addition to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Buffett first purchased shares in 2020, following the merger with Sprint."", ""The merger gave T-Mobile important spectrum assets to fuel its 5G network buildout, helping it become a leader among wireless network operators. That's led to sustained market share gains, rising average revenue per account, and a burgeoning home internet business."", ""But the real story for T-Mobile is its free-cash-flow (FCF) growth. It generated over $4 billion in adjusted FCF last quarter, and it expects to produce between $13.4 billion and $13.6 billion in FCF for the full year. Next year, management has its eye on $18 billion in FCF. That will put it on par with its older competitors in the space as they work to catch up with T-Mobile's network while paying down debt."", ""T-Mobile's strong FCF growth has allowed it to buy back shares at a substantial pace. It announced a $14 billion share repurchase program in late 2022 and added another $19 billion in total shareholder returns in September 2023."", ""The latter authorization includes a new dividend that management intends to grow at an annual pace of 10% for the foreseeable future. And with its strong FCF outlook and substantial buybacks underway, there's no reason to doubt its ability to keep that promise."", ""With shares trading at less than 16 times analysts' estimates for 2024 earnings despite a strong earnings growth outlook, T-Mobile shares look like a great opportunity for investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Indeed, many were saying that higher interest rates as well as an eventual economic downturn would tank the stock markets and compound the previous year’s losses. A few contrarian analysts, however, countered by pointing out that the pessimism was overdone and the resilience of the American economy would keep the markets afloat.', 'Well, it turns out the bulls were right on the money. Far from the doom and gloom that forecasters like Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic had predicted, U.S. stock markets have enjoyed one of the most productive periods in recent decades.', 'All major stock market benchmarks are sitting at, or close to, all-time highs after enjoying epic rallies. The broad market benchmark,\xa0S&P 500,\xa0has returned 25.5% in the year-to-date, a stunning comeback after4 last year’s crash and more than double the market’s median annual gain of about 10% since 2000. The S&P 500 is now just eight points away from hitting its record closing high of 4,796.56. The same scenario has played out with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite with both indices hovering at record highs.', 'Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the commodity markets. The\xa0Bloomberg Commodities Index\xa0(BCOM), a popular benchmark tracked by 23 exchange-traded contracts on physical commodities and more than $100 billion in assets, has cratered nearly 10% YTD, with everything from oil and gas to base metals and grains recording declines. Here’s a rundown of how different commodities performed in 2023.', 'Energy Commodities', 'Energy commodities recorded deep losses across the board with WTI and Brent crude oil futures the only energy contracts to post single-digit losses after falling -9.0% and -5.9%, respectively.\xa0 Gasoline, heating oil, ethanol, refining spreads and Rotterdam coal all record double-digit losses due to weak demand.', 'Meanwhile,\xa0natural gas futures\xa0have crashed 43% in the year-to-date to $2.53/MMBtu, thanks in large part to supply outpacing demand.', 'Precious Metals', 'Precious metals have performed relatively well in the current year, a rather surprising development given that the Fed raised interest rates as recently as May 2023. Spot gold is up 13.6% while silver has gained 1.4% YTD, with much of gold’s rally coming in the final quarter of the year after the Fed turned more dovish and even signaled a possibility of three interest rate cuts in 2024. The gold rally has coincided with a steep fall in interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury declining from 4.98% in mid-October to 3.84% currently.', 'That said, platinum group metals (PGM) have not been as lucky, with platinum’s nearly 7% down to $998.70 per ounce while palladium has suffered an even worse fate after cratering nearly 36% YTD to $1,1160.50 per ounce.', 'Base Metals', '3-month\xa0COMEX copper, LME copper and tin futures three-month have all posted slight gains in the current year; however, prices of other key base metals including aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead have all declined.', 'Key battery metals have had a year to forget. After peaking at an all-time high of nearly CNY 600,000 ($84,015) per tonne in November 2022, lithium carbonate prices have crashed to CNY 97,500 ($13,650) per tonne thanks mainly to a global oversupply. The lithium price crash has been so shocking that a Wall Street analyst has predicted the markets could swing in the opposite direction and\xa0\xa0usher in a lithium shortage\xa0as early as 2025.', 'The same goes for another critical battery metal, nickel, with prices cut nearly in half thanks, again, to supply outpacing demand. The nickel market is facing a supply-demand surplus of 239,000 tonnes, the\xa0largest surplus in at least a decade, the International Nickel Study Group (INSG) has reported. That’s way higher than the group’s last forecast whereby it predicted the surplus will clock in at 171,000 tonnes in the current year.', 'Grains and Soft Commodities', 'The grains markets have not fared any better, with oat futures being the only grain contract to finish in the green after posting a small 1.2% gain. Soybeans and its associated products and wheat have posted double-digit declines with corn falling the most after plunging nearly 30% in the year-to-date. Meanwhile, lean hog futures have declined 21% YTD while feeder cattle futures have pulled back nearly 20% from the September peak due to an influx of supply.', 'The wide pullback has come after grain prices soared in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.', ""If it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023."", ""Nvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion."", ""AI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023."", 'Not every ""Magnificent Seven"" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple\'s revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple\'s business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That\'s fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions.', 'Analysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.', ""Wall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track."", 'Astonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.', ""ChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years."", 'Mid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it\'s becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock\'s resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn\'t as appealing as some other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.', ""It's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky."", 'Interestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business.', ""Over the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail)."", ""Electric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year."", ""Hopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy."", ""Alphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine."", ""The company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry."", ""Nvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium."", 'From a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than ""Magnificent Seven"" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), it doesn\'t make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.', 'I view Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis.', ""Microsoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell."", ""Tesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them."", 'When judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) recently climbed to a record high, with the benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gaining 25% and 44%, year to date, through the closing bell on Dec. 28."", ""But it's not about where Wall Street has been, so much as where the stock market is headed next. If there were such a thing as a perfect forecasting tool, everyone would be using it. Unfortunately, there isn't, which means the best we can do as investors is use a combination of history, macro and company-specific data, and our experience, to make predictions about the future."", 'What follows are 10 stock market predictions -- including macro predictions that can have bearing on the performance of equities -- for 2024.', 'To start with, the most-anticipated recession in U.S. history will finally take shape in the new year.', ""The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), which is comprised of 10 inputs and attempts to anticipate turning points in the business cycle, has declined for 19 consecutive months. With the exception of a 22-month decline from 1973-1975 and a 24-month tumble during the Great Depression, we've never seen a clearer sign that an economic slowdown is expected."", 'Following the money also offers a potentially chilling tale for Wall Street, at least in the very short term. Commercial bank credit has declined since mid-February, which signals that banks are purposefully tightening their lending standards.', 'Meanwhile, M2 money supply is notably falling for the first time since the Great Depression. Less available money for transactions has historically been a telltale sign that an economic downturn is on the horizon.', ""Although the U.S. economy and stock market aren't tied at the hip, a downturn in the economy tends to have a negative impact on corporate earnings. History tells us that roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's drawdowns since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 have occurred after, not prior to, a recession being declared. In other words, if (key word!) a recession was to materialize, a bear market for stocks would probably follow."", 'Something else to consider is that stocks aren\'t cheap. The S&P 500\'s Shiller price-to-earnings ratio (also known as the ""cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) ended Dec. 28 at 32.36. That\'s about 90% higher than its average reading of 17.07, when back-tested 154 years.', ""Further, there have only been six instances since 1870 where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30. Following the previous five occasions, the broader market went on to lose between 20% and 89% of its value. While the Shiller P/E isn't a timing tool, it does suggest that extended periods of premium valuations aren't well-tolerated by Wall Street."", ""The yield curve, which is a chart depicting the yields of various Treasury debt securities relative to their maturity dates, has often been a tell of what's to come for the U.S. economy and stock market."", 'The US Yield Curve (10-year minus 3-month) has now been inverted for 427 consecutive days, the 2nd longest streak in history. Will likely become the longest inversion ever in February 2024. pic.twitter.com/l1q7cVMwSx', '-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) December 27, 2023', ""For the past 428 calendar days, as of Dec. 28, the yield curve that compares the 10-year Treasury bond to three-month Treasury bills has been inverted. This is to say that shorter-dated debt securities (i.e., the three-month bill) have higher yields than the longer-dated bond. While a yield-curve inversion doesn't guarantee that a U.S. recession is imminent, every recession since World War II has been preceded by an inversion."", ""Though the current inversion is likely to become the longest on record (currently 469 calendar days, set between Nov. 1965 and March 1967), it's unlikely to persist throughout the new year. With the nation's central bank expected to begin a rate-easing cycle, it wouldn't be surprising for the yield curve to normalize by year's end."", ""If the Treasury yield curve inversion ends in 2024, highly interest-sensitive companies could benefit. This includes one of Wall Street's most universally disliked industries: mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs)."", 'Popular mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY) and AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) make their living by borrowing money at low short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The greater the gap between the average yield on owned assets less average borrowing rate (this difference is known as ""net interest margin""), the more profitable a mortgage REIT can be.', 'The yield-curve inversion has narrowed the net interest margin for mortgage REITs and made short-term borrowing costlier. But an end to this inversion, coupled with dovish Fed monetary policy, could make Annaly Capital Management and AGNC Investment absolutely sparkle in the eyes of income seekers.', 'Most investors are likely thrilled with the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024. When interest rates decline, it encourages companies to borrow, which can accelerate corporate hiring, fuel acquisition activity, and bolster innovation.', ""But there's another side to this coin. In recent memory, the Fed has cut rates in response to a growth slowdown. During the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that U.S. gross domestic product increased by a red-hot 5.2%. With the nation's central bank planning to reduce rates in 2024, it risks reaccelerating the rate of inflation."", ""The core inflation rate, which removes volatile food and energy costs from the equation, could be particularly stubborn in 2024. A rapid uptick in mortgage rates has effectively frozen the housing market. Nothing short of a hard landing for the U.S. economy is likely to bring the core inflation down to the Fed's long-term target of 2%."", 'One of the primary catalysts that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screaming higher in 2023 is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically assigned to humans, can add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to researchers at PwC.', 'However, history isn\'t on the side of AI\'s continued success -- at least in the short run. Every single next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has gone through an initial bubble period. While many of these trends produced big-time winners over the long-term, the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3D printing, marijuana, blockchain technology, and the metaverse are just some of the examples of highly touted ""new trends"" that weren\'t initially given enough time to mature.', ""The potential bubble-popping event for AI could come from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has established itself as the infrastructure backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) scarcity has sent Nvidia's pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs through the roof in 2023. But as production expands in the new year and competition picks up, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin appear likely to take a hit."", ""With few exceptions over the past decade, tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap. Apple's innovation has been the driving force behind its success. It remains the leading smartphone company by market share in the U.S., and its subscription services segment is rapidly evolving."", ""But when examined as a whole, Apple's growth engine has stalled. All of the company's physical products endured sales declines in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023). While a greater than $600 billion share repurchase program since the start of 2013 has helped lift the company's earnings per share, it's no longer the growth story it once was."", ""With Apple failing to deliver in the growth department, it's Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) that stands ready to ascend to the top of the pedestal. Microsoft Azure accounted for 25% of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the third quarter, according to Canalys. The company is also benefiting from the abundant cash flow of its legacy operations (e.g., Windows and Office), and its steady stream of acquisitions. Microsoft has the necessary catalysts to become the world's most-valuable public company in 2024."", ""Keeping with the theme of Wall Street's most-important and widely owned companies, I fully expect the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker by market cap, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), to fall below $100 per share in the new year. For context, Tesla shares closed at roughly $253 with one trading day left in 2023."", ""Tesla's pricing strategy is a potentially major red flag. During the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla's pricing strategy is based on demand. With the company slashing prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023, it pretty clearly signals that demand is faltering, inventory levels are rising, and competition is picking up. Tesla's once superior operating margin is now on-par with the auto industry average."", ""Furthermore, Elon Musk continues to be a tangible risk for Tesla's shareholders. Despite being a visionary, he frequently overpromises and underdelivers when it comes to new innovations. Though Tesla is valued as a do-it-all company in the energy and auto space, it generates the bulk of its profit from selling and leasing EVs (the auto industry usually sports single-digit earnings multiples), and is reliant on unsustainable sources of income for a sizable percentage of its profit."", ""Next up is the prognostication that the worst-performing sector for the S&P 500 in 2023 will be one of the three best-performing sectors in the new year. I'm talking about utilities."", ""Most investors flock to utility stocks because of their low volatility, market-topping dividends, and predictable operating performance. But with Treasury yields soaring in response to the Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle, investors bid adieu to utilities and opted to purchase Treasury bonds instead. This led to a very poor year for a traditionally safe sector."", ""But with the central bank looking to ease interest rates in 2024, utilities are back on the radar as a potential outperformer. The dividend yields of utilities should become more attractive as Treasury bond yields decline. Further, access to cheaper borrowing rates may fuel acquisitions and major projects that ultimately lift growth rates for the sector's major players -- I'm looking at you, NextEra Energy."", 'Last but not least is the prediction that an unforeseen event will, at least temporarily, weigh down Wall Street.', 'Almost every year features an unexpected event that wreaks havoc on the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. For instance, 2023 saw the short-lived regional banking crisis threaten the fabric of the financial system. The failure of three sizable banks created ripples throughout the financial sector that had investors questioning the solvency of rock-solid banking institutions.', ""In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine served as the year's tumultuous event. The geopolitical implications of Russia's invasion led to a short-term malaise for equities."", ""Though it's impossible to predict what short-term crisis might unfold in 2024, the best guess I can offer is a housing price collapse, or perhaps a wave of auto loan defaults."", 'Only time will tell if this or any of these predictions comes to fruition in the new year.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Nvidia's flagship H100 AI graphics card is priced between $25,000 and $40,000 and reportedly costs around $3,300 to manufacture, according to investment banking firm Raymond James."", ""This explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's bottom line to jump nearly 3.7x year over year to $12.29 per share in fiscal 2024. More importantly, Nvidia is setting itself up to sustain its red-hot growth in the New Year by securing a greater supply of components for its AI chips. Supply chain sources suggest that the company has made substantial advance payments of $540 million and $770 million, respectively, to memory manufacturers SK Hynix and Micron Technology to get its hands on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are deployed in its AI graphics cards."", ""Reports also indicate that Nvidia has signed a contract for HBM chips with Samsung as well. Meanwhile, Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is enhancing its advanced chip packaging capacity to manufacture more AI chips in 2024. All this could help Nvidia triple the output of its highly popular H100 AI graphics cards in the New Year, as pointed out by the British daily newspaper Financial Times."", ""With Gartner predicting a 25% jump in AI chip revenue in 2024 to $67 billion, Nvidia is doing the right thing by securing more supply. This will allow it to maintain its dominance in the AI chip market, where it reportedly has a share of 80%. Not surprisingly, consensus estimates are forecasting a 56% jump in Nvidia's revenue next year to $92 billion. Its earnings are predicted to jump 67%."", ""However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia clocking stronger growth on the back of a big jump in the production of its AI chips, which could help its shares deliver eye-popping gains once again in 2024. Given that Nvidia is trading at a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.5, buying this AI stock is a no-brainer, as a PEG ratio below 1 means that a stock is undervalued."", ""E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon has been rewarded handsomely on the market for the impressive growth that it has been delivering in recent quarters. The company's revenue in the first nine months of 2023 has increased almost 11% year over year to $405 billion, and its guidance for the final quarter indicates that it could deliver annual revenue of $568.5 billion. That would be an increase of roughly 11% from 2022 levels."", ""More importantly, Amazon's growth is expected to remain robust in 2024 and 2025 as well, as the following chart indicates."", 'However, there is a good chance that Amazon could deliver stronger growth on the back of higher e-commerce spending, as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based AI services.', ""According to eMarketer, global e-commerce revenue is likely to increase by 9.4% in 2024 to $6.3 trillion, up from 2023's estimated growth of 8.9%. It is worth noting that Amazon has been outperforming the global e-commerce market's growth of late. In the third quarter, for instance, the company's North American e-commerce revenue was up 11% year over year, while international revenue increased by a similar figure in constant currency terms."", ""So the global e-commerce market's sunny prospects in 2024 are likely to help accelerate the company's growth. However, there is another catalyst that could start moving the needle in a more significant way and help it outpace Wall Street's expectations -- cloud computing."", ""The tech giant's cloud computing offering -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- is the leading player in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a share of 32%, according to Synergy Research Group. This puts Amazon in a nice position to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-based AI services."", ""It is estimated that the cloud AI market could grow at an annual pace of 36% through 2032 and generate a whopping $887 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. Amazon has already started capitalizing on this opportunity. The company's AI offerings on AWS are being used by the likes of BMW, NatWest, PwC, and Genpact, among others, to integrate AI into their operations."", ""As such, it wouldn't be surprising to see an acceleration in AWS' growth in 2024 and beyond as the adoption of AI services in the cloud increases. Given that Amazon is currently trading at 2.9 times sales compared to its five-year average sales multiple of 3.4, investors are getting a relatively good deal on the stock right now.

That's actually more than fast-food titan McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), which had almost 41,200 as of its third quarter."", ""Therefore, while McDonald's is the largest single restaurant chain in the world, Yum! Brands is the larger restaurant company because it has nearly 16,000 more overall locations across its four main brands."", ""Yum! Brands is bigger than McDonald's.

This does account for some of McDonald's higher revenue compared to Yum! Brands. But this isn't even close to the biggest differentiator."", 'To clarify, when a restaurant makes a sale at a company-owned location, the entire sale counts as company revenue. By contrast, when a restaurant makes a sale at a franchised location, only a small percentage of the sale counts as company revenue -- the franchise fee.', ""However, the big difference between Yum! Brands and McDonald's isn't the number of franchised locations versus company-owned locations. The big difference is that McDonald's owns a ton of real estate whereas Yum!

Further, in early 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported on market turmoil (at the time) devastating meme stocks to buy.', 'If that wasn’t bad enough, the WSJ also stated that Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) saw its monthly active users (MAUs) being roughly halved from pandemic-era highs. Obviously, that’s not a great look for comeback meme stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, not all trades from this social-media-driven directive are irrational. Some are quite sensible, so long as you’re willing to risk the volatility inherent in contrarian opportunities. If you’re willing to set aside your preconceptions, below are some compelling ideas from the meme stock tracker.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A grocery store giant, Kroger (NYSE:KR) doesn’t natively come across as one of the comeback meme stocks to buy. Indeed, I’d argue that it’s a sensible idea given the core pertinence of the underlying business. Still, meme traders love KR and thus, it’s one of the names to watch.', 'Relevance: Kroger’s relevance speaks for itself. No matter what goes on with the economy, people need to eat. In terms of hard data, Grand View Research pointes out that the global food and grocery retail market reached a valuation of $11.32 trillion in 2021. Further, experts project a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% from 2022 to 2030. That’s not exciting but here’s the thing: the grocery business is predictable.', 'Pros: Financially, KR seems a compelling idea because of its valuation. Priced at only 10.37x forward earnings, Kroger ranks favorably below 87.5% of sector peers. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $51 price target, projecting 13% upside.', 'Cons: Shares dipped about 2% in the trailing 52 weeks, which is disappointing considering the underlying relevance.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A multinational shipping and receiving firm, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) also specializes in supply chain management. Delivering packages throughout the globe, UPS is natively relevant. However, competitive threats – particularly from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) – have made shares a tough investment.', 'Relevance: In terms of relevance, UPS is a headscratcher for many. According to Allied Market Research, the global express delivery market size reached a valuation of $262.86 billion in 2020. Further, by 2030, this segment could hit $484.38 billion, thus representing a CAGR of 6.4%. But here’s the thing. With Amazon continuing to apply pressure on UPS and its ilk, the future is uncertain. Still, speculators have pushed shares higher in recent sessions.', 'Pros: Financially, UPS prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 29%, beating out nearly 75% of its peers. Also, it’s consistently profitable, possibly making it one of the comeback meme stocks. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a high-side target of $202.', 'Cons: The average analyst target sits at $167.65, implying about 6% upside, which is not very convincing.', 'Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A Chinese multinational technology firm, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) specializes in e-commerce, retail and internet solutions among other businesses. While it may be the flagship enterprise of China, the company suffered heavy losses from its 2020 peak. But for those that see the glass half empty, it could be an opportunity for comeback meme stocks.', 'Relevance: According to data from Statista, China’s retail e-commerce sales value amounted to around $2.68 trillion last year. That right there suggests BABA may be a heavily de-risked opportunity, despite the troubles clouding the world’s second-largest economy. Further, this segment may approach $4 trillion by 2027. Therefore, patient investors willing to ride out volatility could be rewarded handsomely down the line.', 'Pros: While BABA took a beating in the market, Alibaba itself remains financially robust. For example, the company prints a strong cash-to-debt ratio of 3.45x. It also benefits from excellent operating and net margins, leading to consistent profitability.

This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Martin Marietta Materials, it has a TSR of 194% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""We're pleased to report that Martin Marietta Materials shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 49% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 24% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

Nick, good to see you.', 'Nick Sciple: Yeah. Great to be here with you Ricky.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Deidre likes doing M&A Mondays, but we got another pretty major acquisition going on to start us off on Tuesday. Occidental Petroleum, which engages in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, has agreed to buy CrownRock, a private energy producer, for $12 billion. Break this down. Why does Occidental want to buy CrownRock?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, this continue as a wave of really consolidation in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the Permian Basin, the shale patch in the US over the past year. Lots of folks recognizing that they've maybe used some of their best drilling inventory, looking to secure inventory for the long term. Occidental is one of those companies. These assets that they're acquiring from CrownRock are complementary to its existing portfolio in the Permian Basin. Gives them access to additional inventory in a basin that's starting to reach maturity is going to make them one of the largest producers in the Permian. Also, CEO Vicki Hollub has said it's going to give them the ability to weather downturns in a more robust way because CrownRocks wells have a little bit lower decline rates than that from what you see in their core portfolio. So to position them to be able to withstand a little bit different environments. Also worth noting here, looking at Occidental, the way they're structuring this deal using $10 billion in debt. A lot more aggressive than some of the other deals you've seen out there in the market. For example, Exxon went out there and bought Pioneer, used all stock in its transactions. So it continues the trend we've seen in the industry. But maybe a little bit more aggressive, which isn't out of the ordinary for Occidental. If you remember back to their acquisition of Anadarko just a few years ago."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, there's a little bit of oddness with the deal where they're taking out a lot of debt to do it. They're also simultaneously boosting their dividend and selling off other assets, which I think has raised some question marks among investors."", ""Nick Sciple: It'll be interesting to see what happens with those divestments. I think the number was 4.5 to $6 billion in divestments which they'll use to pay down some of that debt they're taking on to acquire CrownRock. Seeing where they sell off assets maybe tells you about the future of the business. Clearly, some attraction to the Permian Basin, maybe some other areas. The emphasize going forward."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, let's focus on the Permian Basin for a second. It's a massive oil fields primarily in West Texas. I think it goes out to New Mexico a little bit. ExxonMobil, purchasing Pioneer, natural resources to get a little bit more of a stake in that ground. Talk about the area, why is there such a rush for producers to get space in this area? It's been well-known for a while that there's a lot of oil in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin."", ""Nick Sciple: I think it's a few things going on to, you mentioned the Permian Basin, the largest, most developed basin in the US. Among the lowest breakevens on the market. Makes it attractive for that reason. Also, as I mentioned earlier, some of the best acreage in the Permian Basin has been drilled. We're at the point where the basin is maturing. US oil production is at all time highs, but it's really only getting back to where we were in 2019. As some of these larger producers are looking to secure inventory for the long term, that makes the Permian attractive. Also, these folks have a lot of cash compared to where they were a couple years ago during the pandemic. Had a couple strong years. So you have some strong balance sheets, a position to go gobble up some of these assets at the same time oil prices are down, 20 percent or so in the past several months, maybe that positions some of these sellers to be a little bit more willing to bid up. So a lot of things going on at once that I think make for a robust deal environment."", 'Ricky Mulvey: So Warren Buffett has a large stake in Occidental Petroleum. He seems to have blessed this deal. There was a private jet visiting Omaha that captured some market commentators attention. The broader market is a little bit more skeptical. I think Occidental trading a little bit down on this news, so. So what do you think the disconnect here is between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Market?', ""Nick Sciple: Yeah, I think it's really this divergence you see in the markets in general. This divergence between what's going on in the near term and then expectations for the long term. In the near term as I mentioned, we've really seen oil prices fall significantly over 20 percent in the past several months. Concerns about weak demand in China, concerns that maybe these OPEC cuts that we've seen won't be as sticky as the market hopes. But long term, these inventory dynamics I talked about in the Permian continue to play out as we've used some of the best, some of the best rockets. In order to maintain these levels of production that we're seeing today, you're going to need to see some of this consolidation take place. I think near term, some skepticism about oil prices. I think the supply demand picture a lot more robust long term, more attractive looking long term. I think that's what these acquirers are seeing."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. Let's move on to the next story. Disney and Netflix have agreed to a short-term domestic content agreement. Netflix is going to get to Stream 14 Library shows on a non-exclusive basis. Those include Grey's Anatomy, This is Us, and ESPN's 30 for 30 Library. Nick, this is a big deal, but what is the signal to you?"", ""Nick Sciple: I think this continues a trend of lots of folks in the entertainment landscape that had positioned themselves to maybe compete directly with Netflix now saying we can't compete with Netflix in the way that we had hoped. Challenges to Disney's maybe core cable business makes licensing this content to Netflix a little bit more attractive. You've seen that from other folks out there in the industry as well. When I think about this isn't the best Disney content out there. They're not putting Star Wars and Marvel, they're putting Grey's Anatomy and 30 for 30. But I think that this content is more, I guess, punches above its weight on Netflix platform than it does on some of these other platforms. The analogy I keep thinking about with this is like Netflix is like TV. Do you ever remember back in the days of cable when there'd be some movie on TV? Like, the classic Con Air, Nicholas Cage's movie. That's not a movie you would ever seek out to watch, but if it's on TV you might. I think Netflix is in that dynamic as well, where I don't think a lot of folks sought out suits when it was on other streaming platforms, but they watched it in droves on Netflix. Netflix is profitable. They're actually able to pay up for some of this content, and folks actually watched it on their platform, whereas they might get lost in some other streaming platform. I think it's a sign of Netflix's strength and they've kind of won the streaming war."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Unlike some other companies, Disney has been very careful to say the core properties are not going there. I think it's, to your point, it's a win for both companies. Because Disney gets to say, hey, we're not going to give you the Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars stuff, and Netflix, honestly, maybe they don't care because it's the shows that you can have on the background. Maybe in ESPN, 30 for 30 that you've watched a few other times. Back in June, Netflix made a licensing deal with Warner Brothers Discovery. It was about six months after David Zaslav asked his team to shut down deals between them and Netflix because he didn't like. It was like some certain deal that they had with the show Sandman. Now that's why you're seeing DC movies on Netflix as well as some HBO series on there. How did Netflix get into this position of strength? Why is Netflix in a position to be a buyer right now?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, I think Netflix is profitable in streaming in a way that many of these other folks aren't. They've been able to achieve scale and cash flow that other folks aren't able to achieve in streaming. Another thing that I think is worth noting, as well as Netflix doesn't have a legacy business to protect or legacy debt to support in the way that the Warner Brothers Discovery does. So Netflix's streaming business is profitable, gives them the ability to go buy up some of some of this content and these other companies frankly need it because of their financial situation."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, for Netflix, one thing I found interesting about them, and I think this deal shows it, is they spend a ton of money buying these long-running sitcoms and they've had very little success making them. They're happy to spend so much money on. For a while, it was the office. Now it's going to be Grey's Anatomy, and This Is Us. They don't make the stuff that they spend lots of money buying, they'd rather pay for the hits."", ""Nick Sciple: Yeah. I think the media business is an inherently an uncertain one when you're making content that does not yet have an audience out there. It's a lot easier to do that calculus for, licensed content that has an existing audience in place. I think if I am Netflix and I have the ability to pay a reasonable price for this content that has already made and already has an existing audience. I think that's a lot more attractive bet than trying to come up with a new property from zero. I think even Netflix's management has said, they're going to slow down a little bit on original production. Part of that is because they have access to license content in a way they maybe didn't expect to have a few years ago when competition was more intense."", ""Ricky Mulvey: A lot of traveling coming up for the holidays. People ask you for stock rec, sometimes, I'm not going to do that. You got any Netflix recs as we get to traveling for the holidays?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, on the topic of long-running sitcoms that Netflix didn't produce, I like to just play the hits, Seinfeld's on Netflix these days. I spend a lot of time watching that. That's one for me. If you want something new, I'm into the cult shows Escaping Twin Flames. Kept me glued to the couch for a few hours. Maybe check that one out as well if you're in cults and their craziness."", 'Ricky Mulvey: I asked you for a TV wreck and you had Seinfeld is number one and it is 2023 disciple. That\'s right. I\'ll throw out, if you like the docu-series, there\'s one that\'s excellent. Well, there\'s one I\'m going to recommend after we record, but I don\'t want to recommend it on a wide-scale basis. MerPeople is phenomenal. It is the subculture of people who are mermaids. It is a three-part documentary series. It is honestly, it is one of the strongest stories that has hooked me in, where a mermaid in Arkansas has to go on the hero\'s journey so she can live out her dream. Shout Out Sparkles. As we move to our next story. Alphabet versus Epic, the video game maker Epic seems to have a major win. They\'re known for making Fortnight. A jury in Northern California said that Google basically has monopoly power over the Android app market. Google did anti-competitive things, and moreover, Epic was hurt by those practices. Google shareholders really don\'t seem to mind. You\'ve also got a Bloomberg headlining saying, ""This decision could upend the mobile app economy"". Nick Sciple. What say you?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, certainly always worth paying attention to whenever Google loses an antitrust case, has been long debated whether those App Store fees, I think it's 15 percent on the baseline that Google and Apple charge, aren't monopoly profits. We finally have a jury that has made that ruling. Now, are we going to upend the mobile app economy? We'll see the Court still needs to determine the appropriate remedies to take. They're going to hold a hearing in January to decide what steps to take to fix this anti-competitive industry. But whatever choices that Court makes could lead the way we go about buying apps and consuming them different in the future than it has been today. Certainly could mean that the money that Google and Apple are able to achieve from those app stores smaller in the future."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One of the crux of it seems to be that Epic wanted to make their own app store within Google, which technically Google allows, of course. Or the Epic complaint is essentially put up this warning screen, like if you download this app store, you're opening yourself up to all these viruses, that sort of thing and that may have been anti-competitive. But what do you think the implications are if software developers can go on these platforms, Google and Apple, and make their own app stores? I would say this outcome seems unlikely, but not impossible."", ""Nick Sciple: It certainly would be gravity for the amount of fees that Google and Apple are able to charge for folks to transact through the App Store. It would be in the interest of consumers to save a little bit of money by doing things that way. I think to the extent you see those royalties fall for Google and Apple than folks who sell via those app stores, that presumably would fall to the bottom line for a company like Match Group or Spotify or other it's out there in the market. So a shrinking profit pool for some of these big companies could open up additional profits for other businesses. You think about a company like Valve with Steam. Steam is really a dominant app purchase platform. And you think about games online. Could all of a sudden Steam compete more directly with Google and Apple when it comes to the games ecosystem? Something like that could be interesting."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We're not the only ones watching this story. I'm sure the C suite of Apple has checked out the headline this morning. How do you think Apple's taking this news?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, you recall Apple was able to prevail over App, at least a judge was able to rule in their favor. Didn't get to a jury trial. To the extent this ruling sticks, again, this is a meaningful threat to Apple's App store, which gives them an advantage over others in the, in the Apple ecosystem. So I think if I'm Apple, I would be worried. But we'll see what the court does next. What remedies they choose, how much that will impact the future for Apple."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Nick Sciple, thank you for your time and your insight. I'll see you later this week. Looking forward to it."", ""Nick Sciple: Looking forward to seeing you in DC for Foolapalooza. It's been a long time. Excited to get back."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Coming up on the end of the year, and one thing we get is a lot of people trying to improve their financial situation as they begin the New Year.

We're also going to be recording a mail bag with Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick next week. If you have personal finance questions for them, that's a great place to do it. Up next, Mark Kantrowitz is a nationally recognized expert on student financial aid, scholarships, and college savings plans. He's also the author of five books, including How to appeal for more college financial aid. Robert Brokamp spoke with Kantrowitz about recent changes to the financial application process. Who's going to get more aid and who will end up actually paying more?"", ""Robert Brokamp: The free application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA, is usually available on October 1, but it's been delayed this year while the Department of Education makes significant changes to the form and how aid is determined. So Mark what are some of the biggest differences between the old FAFSA, the new FAFSA, which supposedly will be available sometime on or before December 31st."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: The new FAFSA is much shorter and simpler than the old FAFSA. They got rid of about two thirds of the questions. Can't say the exact number, because a lot depends on the particular circumstances of the student and their family. But on average we're going to see one third as many questions. Which means instead of taking an hour, it might take 15, 20 minutes for people to complete the form. That's one big change. Another change is that it will become easier for students to qualify for the Pell Grant. There will be more financial aid for low income students, but there are several changes that make it harder for middle and high income students to qualify for aid. For example, they get rid of the sibling loophole, which divided the parent contribution by the number of children in college. So a parent who had $100,000 of income was approximately the same as a parent who has $50,000 in income if the parent with a six figure income had twice as many children in college at the same time. They're also getting rid of the small business exclusion. Small businesses will count as an asset and the family farm exclusion. Now, a more recent problem, FAFSA includes a whole bunch of different tables of numbers that are supposed to be adjusted for inflation. An example is the income protection allowance shelters a portion of the family income. There's also an income protection allowance for the student income. The US Department of Education is not doing that inflation adjustment, even though it's required by law this year. They will do it for the 2025, 26 FAFSA. But they're saying that the timeline is too tight and it's too complicated for them to do right now, so they'll need to hunt on it for this year. But that means that the typical student is going to qualify for thousands of dollars less financial aid then they're entitled to. I don't think that's right."", ""Robert Brokamp: Yeah, I saw you quoted in a CNBC article about this. Do you think this is something that if there's enough of an uproar about it that they will change or is it really just too late?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, it may be too late because they're already seem to be running right up against the deadline. So the due date for the FAFSA, as you noted, is going to be December 31st instead of October 1st. That's not that big a deal, and if you go back eight years, the FAFSA had to start date of January 1st. It wasn't ideal, but the switch to October 1st was an improvement. But it's not just that students will only be able to start submitting the FAFSA on December 31st. It's also the colleges are not going to get a copy of the students FAFSA information until late January. That pushes the schedule for getting financial aid award offers to the students back significantly. I wouldn't be surprised if college financial aid offers are made in late March or early April as opposed to early March. Because of this, if the colleges squeeze the schedule as much as they can, who knows what problems there may be with this FAFSA, there hasn't been any public beta testing of it. So there could be a lot of glitches when it first launches."", 'Robert Brokamp: Wow. People, be prepared to be patient and maybe be delayed on getting your aid package.', 'Mark Kantrowitz: Yes.', ""Robert Brokamp: Let's talk about a couple other changes that I believe are coming. One is the change in the way the FAFSA handles divorced parents. What's going to be different about."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: So when the parents are divorced or separated or never married. If they live together, they're treated as though they're married. But if they live apart, then only one parent is responsible for completing the FAFSA. This used to be the parent with whom the child lived the most. But starting with the 2024, 25, it'll be the parent who provided the most financial support to the student in the 12 months ending on the date the FAFSA is filed. Now if the parents provide an equal amount of financial support, then it'll be whichever parent has a greater income, counting the income of any step-parents, that gives the parents an incentive to make sure that it's a parent with a lower income who provides more support so that the student will qualify for more financial aid."", ""Robert Brokamp: Another change is grandparents owned 529, a lot of grandparents, they opened 529 for their grand-kids in the past form the assets were not included on the FAFSA but distributions from those 529 were counted as untaxed income. But as I understand it, that's going away so that it's almost like the FAFSA doesn't know anything about any grandparent 529."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: There used to be a question on the FAFSA called the cash support question, which is where you would report untaxed income to the student. There was no similar question for parents. That question has been eliminated and that's where you would report distributions from grandparent on 529 plans and also gifts to the student from grandparents, aunts and uncles. And it's not just grandparents, it's anybody other than the student or the student's custodial parent. So the treatment for a custodial five to nine plans that are owned by the student or the five to nine plan that is owned by a dependent student's parent, that hasn't changed, those are still reported as parent assets on the FAFSA. There is one slight change which is if the parent owns a five to nine plan, not just for the student but for the student's siblings, the five to nine plans for the student's siblings are not going to be reported on the FAFSA so that will yield an improvement. So you're not counting your brother or sisters as five to nine plan against your aid eligibility. So there's a couple of changes here and the change in the treatment of 5-9 plans owned by the grandparent, aunts, uncles, or anybody other than the student or parent, that is a significant positive change in that it makes those 5-9 plans disappear. They aren't reported as an asset and distribution. Qualified distributions aren't counted as untaxed income on the FAFSA. Now, if you make a non-qualified distribution, that is going to show up in your adjusted gross income and that will affect your financial aid eligibility. But so long as you use the 5-9 plans the way they were intended if it's owned by a grandparent, it has no impact."", ""Robert Brokamp: So putting it all together who's going to benefit the most from these changes and who's eligibility for aid is actually going to be reduced due to these changes?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, there are a bunch of cross currents. So generally low income students will get more aid. The Pell Grant formula has a new secondary formula on top of the existing formula. The secondary formula compares the family income to two thresholds based on a multiple other poverty line. So if your parent's income is less than 175% of the poverty line, you're going to get the maximum Pell Grant regardless of what the primary formula says, and if the income is less than another threshold, which depends on whether a single parent household or a two-parent household. But if you are under that threshold, you're going to get at least a minimum Pell Grant. These changes mean that more than 500,000 additional students will qualify for a Pell Grant and of all the students who qualify for a Pell Grant, an additional 1.5 million of them will qualify for the maximum Pell Grant. There will be more grant money being awarded to low-income students. More of them are going to qualify and more of them are going to get the maximum grant. That means low-income students are generally going to benefit significantly from the new form. Middle and high-income families may have a decrease in their aid eligibility. It used to be that families with six-figure incomes could nevertheless qualify for a Pell Grant. If they had multiple children in college at the same time, that's no longer going to be there. They won't qualify many of them for the Pell Grant. Now the change with regard to grandparent-owned 5-9 plans, that's going to be a benefit, especially when the grandparents are wealthy but the family is not, it's hard to predict any individual have a generality that says, oh, all these students are not going to get more aid or to get less aid. And these aren't, but we have these general trends. Low-income students get more financial aid, middle and high-income students get less financial aid."", 'Robert Brokamp: It definitely seems to me like if you have kids in college, like I do now, I have three kids in college. You pay a certain amount this year based on how you filled out the face. There could be a significant difference for next year if you have multiple kids or if you own that farm or if you own that business.', ""Mark Kantrowitz: Yes, definitely. Necessarily from the federal government or the state government, but maybe from the colleges themselves. You will get less financial aid because of that change in the student name index, which is the new name for the EFC. Now I would recommend appealing to the college. Point out that last year you got a certain amount of financial aid, and this year you're getting much less, even though your income hasn't changed. Now what I think some colleges may do is try to hold the family harmless if you're a returning student. If you're a brand new student, you might not get any adjustments. But the colleges are concerned about the potential shock to the family finances from if they have like three kids in college at the same time. And each of them gets $3,000 less financial aid, that's perhaps as much as $10,000 less aid. And it'll vary significantly from one family to the next in terms of the impact that may make it very difficult for the family to afford that college education."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Although the hedge fund business is merely an enclave of the financial markets, its activities provide valuable insights to market participants.', 'Hedge fund trades fuel any investment analysis; however, they should be placed into perspective. For those unaware, hedge funds rely on active strategies that assume short-term horizons. Moreover, hedge funds reveal their positions after the fact, meaning their portfolio alterations are communicated months after implementation. As such, investors should not look at hedge fund positions in isolation but instead consider them as part of a holistic analysis.', 'With the aforementioned considered, here are three stocks hedge funds are selling en masse.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com', 'According to its latest 13f filing, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square sold\xa0$83.6 million\xa0worth of\xa0LOW\xa0(NYSE:LOW) stock in its third quarter. LOW stock is up by more than 10% since the turn of the year. However, Ackman’s investment fund somehow believes the stock is overvalued.', 'The Michigan Consumer Sentiment indicator showed that U.S. consumer sentiment surged by roughly\xa013.7%\xa0in November. Moreover,\xa0U.S. personal income\xa0is growing steadily. As such, I’m not quite sure that top-down variables align with Ackman’s outlook.', 'Despite top-down variables supporting a bullish case for Lowe’s, the company possesses a few idiosyncratic concerns, possibly explaining Ackman’s bearish call on LOW stock. The firm released its third-quarter earnings report last month, revealing a revenue miss of\xa0$390 million. Furthermore, organic growth is slowing as comparable sales have decreased by 7.4% year-over-year.', 'The company’s latest financial results place LOW stock’s price-to-earnings ratio at\xa024.08x, which isn’t compelling at all. Even though I think this stock is a Hold instead of a Sell, Ackman’s bearish case has a reasonable basis.

Therefore, it would be unfair of me to guess why Burry and Vanguard sold EXPE stock. However, my own analysis tells me that various quantitative-driven funds could be concerned about EXPE stock’s technical features. For example, EXPE stock’s\xa0put-call ratio\xa0has slid past one, suggesting bearish sentiment has emerged. In addition, EXPE stock’s near 80% year-to-date gain has sent its relative strength index to\xa075.61, suggesting EXPE stock is overbought.', 'Expedia’s fundamental stealth contradicts Burry and Vanguard’s outlook. The company delivered robust results in its third quarter by surpassing its revenue and earnings-per-share targets by\xa0$70 million\xa0and 41 cents, respectively. Moreover, Expedia has embarked on a fresh\xa0$5 billion\xa0share buyback program to lower its investors’ cost basis. Expedia’s buyback program, paired with its forward price-to-earnings-growth ratio of\xa00.3x, indicates that we are looking at a decent stock here, which is why I dispute Michael Burry’s bearish outlook.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'OXY (NYSE:OXY) stock is a Warren Buffet favorite, spanning\xa04%\xa0of Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A,NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio.

A mass exodus from OXY stock has unfolded, which makes sense as a cyclical inflection point has emerged.', 'The inflection point I’m referring to refers to top-down variables. Occidental Petroleum faces waning industrial production in the\xa0U.S.\xa0and\xa0Europe, which raises demand concerns. Although a recent shift in U.S. consumer sentiment and improving\xa0China PMI numbers\xa0can phase out demand-side risks, industrial production often lags consumer sentiment, raising concerns about the near-term prospects for petrochemical sales.', 'Furthermore, OXY stock’s valuation suggests its stock price has yet to reflect its fundamental worth.

Additionally, OXY stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.01x is at a 53% premium to its 5-year average.

However, it can be fun to attempt to predict what might happen.', ""Three Fool.com contributors have done just that. Here's why they think that Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AXSM), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) will soar in 2024."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Axsome Therapeutics): The past two years have been transformative for Axsome Therapeutics. The company finally became a commercial-stage biotech by marketing two therapies, from which it is generating some sales. That was an important milestone, but Axsome's revenue remains modest while it is still chronically unprofitable."", ""The biotech failed to keep up with the broader market in 2023, but 2024 could be very different. Axsome's late-stage pipeline includes several programs that could land brand-new approvals or, at the very least, important clinical trial results. Let's consider two examples."", ""First, there is the company's approved depression medicine, Auvelity. It is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) agitation (or aggressive and restless symptoms). The biotech should complete a second phase 3 study for Auvelity along these lines in the first half of next year. Note: Auvelity did ace the first clinical trial in treating AD agitation, so things are looking pretty good."", 'Then there is AXS-07, a potential migraine therapy. This medicine failed to earn approval once -- but entirely because of manufacturing issues. Axsome is planning to resubmit an application to regulatory authorities next year. With some luck, an approval could come down too.', ""Several more clinical and regulatory catalysts could send Axsome's shares soaring next year, and by the end of 2024, the company's lineup could look different. That's why the company could be in for a great 12 months."", ""More importantly, Axsome Therapeutics' pipeline should allow it to set a strong foundation for the medium term."", 'David Jagielski (Novo Nordisk): This year has been a great one for diabetes and weight-loss company Novo Nordisk as its shares are up more than 45%. But even despite achieving such impressive gains, there can still be much more upside for the stock next year and beyond.', ""The company has one of the best weight-loss drugs on the market right now in Wegovy. While the public may be more familiar with Ozempic, the diabetes drug consumers have been using off-label to lose weight, it's Wegovy that could ultimately end up being Novo Nordisk's top-selling product."", ""A lot of the hype these days appears to be behind rival Eli Lilly, which looks to have the more promising weight-loss treatment in Zepbound -- it has helped people achieve greater weight loss in clinical trials. But the reality is that within a promising antiobesity drug market, which can be worth $100 billion (according to estimates from Goldman Sachs), there's plenty of room for more than one weight-loss treatment. And investors are paying a steep premium for Eli Lilly's stock -- 105 times earnings, versus a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42 for Novo Nordisk."", ""While a P/E multiple of 42 isn't normally cheap, it can be in the context of the potential growth ahead for the business. Over the past three quarters, Wegovy's revenue has soared 481%. Novo Nordisk is still in the early stages of rolling the product out internationally."", ""What could work to Novo Nordisk's advantage is its focus on diabetes and weight loss, two areas where there is an ongoing need for treatment now and for years to come. By not diversifying into other areas, it can focus on two high-growth opportunities, which can lead to more focused results and better returns for investors."", 'Novo Nordisk looks like a solid stock to buy for next year and beyond, as it still has plenty of room to rise further in value.', ""Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Few stocks perform well during both up and down markets; Vertex is one of them. While the S&P 500 plunged more than 19% in 2022, Vertex's shares jumped nearly 32%. The stock also soared more than 40% in 2023, with the S&P 500 vaulting close to 25% higher. I think that there will be plenty of more fireworks on the way from this big biotech."", ""Vertex is likely to soon bolster its already lucrative cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. The company plans to announce results from late-stage clinical studies of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo in early 2024. I predict positive results followed by multiple regulatory approvals. I also look for the vanzacaftor triple-drug combo to become Vertex's most profitable CF therapy of all because of its lower royalty burden."", 'The company also expects to soon report results from three late-stage studies of VX-548 in treating acute pain. This non-opioid drug could be another huge winner for Vertex due to the significant unmet need, complicated by the side effects and addictive potential of opioids.', ""We can't leave out Casgevy (exa-cel). Vertex recently won U.S. approval for the gene-editing therapy in treating sickle cell disease. It awaits another approval decision in treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Casgevy's launch will likely be a slow one, but the therapy has excellent commercial prospects as a one-time functional cure for these two rare blood disorders."", 'Finally, Vertex plans to advance inaxaplin into phase 3 testing in the first quarter of 2024. The experimental drug targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease, an indication that affects more patients than CF.', ""All of these should provide nice catalysts for Vertex in 2024. I won't go out on a limb and predict another gain of 40% or more, but I wouldn't rule it out, either."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's riskier to invest earlier along in a company's development, but that's precisely where the largest returns lie, which means that now is the time to be looking for the rising stars of tomorrow."", ""While there's no telling precisely which companies are going to succeed or fail, there is a pair of early-stage gene editing businesses that are worth keeping on your radar. If their plans come to fruition -- and that's a big if -- they could deliver handsome profits to their shareholders."", ""Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA) might be the next CRISPR Therapeutics because it's in clinical trials to develop curative gene-editing interventions for a pair of inherited diseases: Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, and hereditary angioedema (HAE)."", ""Its ATTR program is entering into phase 3 trials now, and the HAE program is wrapping up enrollment for its phase 2 study. If everything goes as planned, it also could initiate a phase 1 trial for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease in 2024. That means by 2030, it's possible (though improbable) that the company could have three different gene-editing medicines on the market."", ""Importantly, Intellia is backed by Regeneron, which will be responsible for 25% of the costs and profits of the ATTR program. That bodes well for its chances of being another CRISPR Therapeutics. Regeneron itself is roughly the same size as Vertex, which was instrumental in getting CRISPR's first program out the door, so the company can bring substantial financial resources to bear to help Intellia if necessary."", ""So far, the biotech doesn't look like it needs any help. Its cash and investments are worth $855 million, but its trailing-12-month research and development (R&D) expenses are only $426 million."", ""But investors should be aware that it might face competition for market share in the ATTR market, assuming its therapy is proven to be safe and effective and that regulators agree to let the company sell it. As of Dec. 21, AstraZeneca just commercialized a therapy that treats polyneuropathy in the context of ATTR, so patients may eschew Intellia's curative treatment."", ""But CRISPR Therapeutics faces competition in its first market, too, so don't count this business out."", ""Verve Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VERV) only has one program in clinical trials, its VERVE-101 candidate to treat or cure heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), which is in phase 1. In its initial form, VERVE-101 aims to permanently correct problems in patients' genomes that lead them to experience dangerously high LDL-C cholesterol levels. But management thinks that once there's a working proof of concept in the most severe patients, it might be possible to expand the scope of the project to eventually treat the 20% of the entire population who are at risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). If that happens, way down the road it could treat hundreds of millions of people."", ""For now, Verve has a lot of work to do, and it has the right players in its corner to make serious progress. Its champion and collaborator is none other than Eli Lilly, a company with a tremendous amount of resources. It's also working with Vertex Pharmaceuticals."", ""Eli Lilly clearly sees promise in what the biotech is working on. In late October, it purchased some of the commercialization rights for VERVE-101 and a few other programs that Verve had initially granted to another collaborator, Beam Therapeutics, presumably to ensure that it could get in on the action. If the pair escalate or alter their collaboration again, it'll be another bullish sign."", ""Verve's chances of becoming the next CRISPR Therapeutics are also buoyed by its substantial cash reserves of $485 million as of the third quarter. It additionally raised $144 million in a public stock offering in early December, as well as $23 million in a private placement. Considering that it burned only $154 million in cash over the trailing-12-month period, it won't even need to lean on its collaborators anytime soon."", ""And that kind of strong balance sheet means that it's a biotech stock worth watching, to say the least."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

And the two have locked horns for cola supremacy ever since."", ""Neither Coke nor Pepsi was able to take down its cola competitor. So it wasn't long before these two companies upped the ante by developing comprehensive soda-brand portfolios. Nowadays, PepsiCo sells well-known sodas such as Mountain Dew, Pepsi Wild Cherry, Mug Root Beer, Crush, and Starry in addition to its eponymous Pepsi."", ""PepsiCo built its portfolio by making several key acquisitions. Its 1964 acquisition of Mountain Dew was especially crucial to its present-day success. In the U.S. carbonated soft-drink market, Mountain Dew had 6.6% market share in 2022, according to Statista. I'd say that buyout worked out quite well."", ""Pepsi's Mountain Dew acquisition was huge. But a merger the following year was even more significant for the company and its shareholders."", ""It has nothing to do with carbonated soft drinks. But almost half of Pepsi's profits today are derived from a source that would have shocked the beverage company's founders."", ""In 1965, Pepsi-Cola merged with Frito-Lay — a snack company with a portfolio that today includes Lay's, Fritos, Doritos, Cheetos, Funyuns, Spitz, Cracker Jack, and more. This was a strong departure for a business formerly focused entirely on carbonated soft drinks. But it was a good move."", ""Through the first three quarters of 2023, PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America business segment has generated revenue of $17.4 billion. That's nearly as big as its Beverages North America segment's revenue of $19.7 billion."", ""In North America, Pepsi's snack revenue nearly matches the revenue from beverages. But these snack foods actually have better profit margins. Frito-Lay's operating income of $4.9 billion is better than operating income of just $2.2 billion for beverages."", ""Not only is Frito-Lay's operating income higher than beverages, it's also accounted for 48% of PepsiCo's total operating income year to date. In short, if Pepsi hadn't pivoted to snacks nearly 60 years ago, it would be half the company that it is today."", ""There are so many potential takeaways with an observation like this for PepsiCo. For starters, as one of the largest beverage companies in the world both then and now, Pepsi's growth would have been more limited if it had stayed completely within its core competency. Expanding outside of it into an adjacent market with robust cross-promotion opportunities made a lot of sense."", ""It's similar to what Hershey is doing now, extending beyond candy and into snack items such as pretzels and popcorn."", 'More broadly, companies that can expand beyond core competencies often make good investments; this trait is known as optionality.

It’s low but neither the yield nor the business is going anywhere.', 'Cons: Analysts on average only see shares reaching $182.88, which is pedestrian.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'What it is: A multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a mainstay among solid dividend stocks to buy. Manufacturing a wide range of personal and consumer health products, along with myriad other household goods, P&G is practically permanently relevant.', 'Relevance: Where do we start? If you brush your teeth every day, you’re likely using one of P&G’s toothcare brands. If you use the facilities – and without getting too graphic want a “comfortable” experience – you’re also likely to use P&G brands. If you want some hard numbers, the global consumer goods market should rise by a CAGR of 3.23% between 2023 and 2028. That sounds very reasonable.', 'Pros: Obviously, the case for PG as one of the dividend stocks centers on the underlying business predictability. It’s been consistently profitable, year in and year out. As a result, it pays a yield of 2.6%, which isn’t too shabby considering how low risk it is.', 'Cons: Over the past 52 weeks, PG lost about 5% of equity value, which is disappointing.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational pharmaceutical and medical technologies corporation, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another mainstay among dividend stocks to buy. Thanks to the pertinence of the business, J&J might enjoy some economic insulation.', 'Relevance: With the company spinning off its consumer health products division, J&J can focus on its core businesses. First, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry may expand at a CAGR of nearly 6% between 2023 and 2028, resulting in market value of $802.8 billion. Second, EY reports that the medtech market reached a valuation of $573 billion in 2022. Even with modest growth projected following the post-pandemic high, J&J should benefit handsomely from its brand power.', 'Pros: Benefiting from excellent profit margins across the board, J&J is a consistently reliable company. Even so, the market prices shares at a discount at 11.54X trailing-year earnings. That’s lower than 81% of sector rivals. And the yield isn’t bad at 3.07%.', 'Cons: JNJ has been struggling for traction, losing about 13% of equity value on a year-to-date basis.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'What it is: An icon in the soft drink industry, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) really needs no introduction. As a symbol of American capitalism, it’s also one of the solid dividend stocks to buy for market ambiguity. No matter what happens, Coca-Cola will be around.', 'Relevance: As I’ve stated many times before, if we encounter economic hardships, KO should benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, people will turn to grocery store products to get their caffeine fix. Considering that’s where Coca-Cola dominates, KO should be a winner. Either way, the soft drink space is worth $328.1 billion just in the U.S. So, KO will have zero problems securing relevance.', 'Pros: As with the other dividend stocks, Coca-Cola’s knockout punch centers on its excellent margins and consistent profitability. From these attributes, we have a dividend yield of 3.19%.', 'Cons: Due to the predictability of the business, the market prices KO at a modest premium to earnings. Also, the payout ratio of 69.43% is a bit on the high side.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An energy firm which has pivoted strongly to renewable sources, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) ranks among the most important dividend stocks for investors seeking long-term opportunities. From a bullish perspective, NEE’s volatility this year may represent a de-risked prospect.', 'Relevance: I’m not going to go so far as to say renewable energy is our exclusive future. However, it’s clear that the political and ideological winds support various go-green initiatives. That alone makes NEE worth a long look. For hard data, Grand View Research states that the global renewable energy sector is currently worth $1.21 trillion. By 2030, the segment could hit $3.6 trillion, representing a CAGR of 17.2%.', 'Pros: While NextEra doesn’t print the prettiest financial stats, it is consistently profitable. And thanks to this consistency, it’s able to offer a yield of 3.13%. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $69.88 price target, implying 17% upside.', 'Cons: Still, NEE is down 29%, which admittedly represents an unsightly performance.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'What it is: One of the top technology firms in the world, IBM (NYSE:IBM) commands respect for its legacy innovations. And it’s still a contemporary powerhouse though its peers have overshadowed Big Blue. Nevertheless, IBM deserves consideration as one of the solid dividend stocks, especially because it’s been on the move recently.', 'Relevance: Before the huge mania over artificial intelligence and machine learning erupted this year, IBM stood at the forefront of this innovation through protocols such as Watson. However, it also offers myriad other relevancies, such as utilizing blockchain technology for practical applications. Sure enough, the global blockchain market reached a valuation of $11.14 billion last year. And by 2030, the segment could be worth $469.49 billion.', 'Pros: A major advantage for IBM as an attractive investment is that it’s undervalued; specifically, it trades at only a forward earnings multiple of 16.31x. Additionally, the company offers a strong dividend yield of 4.12%.', 'Cons: Analysts are somewhat pensive about IBM’s surge, with the average $156.71 price target implying 3% downside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Realty Income (NYSE:O) focuses on free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S., Spain and the U.K. Primarily, what may attract investors is that it’s one of the dividend stocks that pays out monthly.', 'Relevance: I’m not going to sit here and tell you that Realty Income is an exciting enterprise. However, it’s quite possible that irrespective of economic conditions, Realty should perform relatively well. Because its properties feature stores that cater to the essentials – grocery giants, big-box retailers – the business practically enjoys permanent relevance.', 'Pros: Financially, Realty benefits from two major attributes: solid revenue growth compared to other REITs and consistent profitability. Especially from the latter, investors have confidence in the generous 5.33% yield.', 'Cons: Shares lost about 11% since the beginning of the year so investors need to be cautious.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that General Electric had US$20.8b of debt in September 2023, down from US$30.4b, one year before. However, it also had US$18.1b in cash, and so its net debt is US$2.74b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that General Electric had liabilities of US$48.2b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$78.7b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$18.1b as well as receivables valued at US$16.1b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$92.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$138.9b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""General Electric has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.23. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 16.0 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Even more impressive was the fact that General Electric grew its EBIT by 436% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, General Electric generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 88% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""The good news is that General Electric's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, General Electric seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with General Electric (including 1 which is significant) ."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

When we see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) in conjunction with a declining base of capital employed, that's often how a mature business shows signs of aging. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. On that note, looking into Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.
