Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)An Aug. 21 regulatory filing from Charles Schwab detailing plans to downsize its real estate footprint marks the latest headwinds to confront the office market, but the lack of termination options at the affected properties may make the short-term damage largely muted, according to a new analysis from Barclays (BCS).While Schwab did not detail what specific offices it will close, a company memo in July noted plans to shutter offices in Atlanta, San Antonio, San Diego, St. Louis and Tampa while also reducing its footprint in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Jersey City and Henderson, Nev. The Chicago, San Francisco and Jersey City Schwab offices all secure commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) debt, but none of those locations has termination options, according to the Barclays report. Charles Schwab does have a termination option for its Orlando property, but the Florida city was not one of the markets targeted for cutting office space, Barclays analysts Lea Overby and Anuj Jain wrote. The lack of a termination option in cities where Schwab plans to cut its office space therefore indicates “near-term performance may not be affected,” according to Overby and Jain.In an interview Tuesday, Jain told Commercial Observer that while the near-term impact to the affected CMBS properties will be small, news of companies like Charles Schwab significantly cutting office space will negatively affect investor demand for other office deals. “The more this kind of news comes out, it becomes more challenging to have office in new issuance [CMBS] deals,” Jain said. “It’s going to be a slow burn because when you get news like this you have to see what happens in the next three years and five years and seven years. It’s like watching the paint dry.” Of the locations where Charles Schwab plans to reduce headcount, its Jersey City office at 70 Hudson Street has the longest remaining lease, running until June 2033, according to Barclays. Schwab’s San Francisco lease expires in April 2028, and the Chicago lease expires December 2027, the Barclays research shows.  Story continuesFor its Orlando Maitland Office Portfolio property, Charles Schwab has a lease that runs until February 2026 for the entire 124,934 square feet of Summit Park II.

Starting with Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund (LGILX) should not be a possibility at this time. LGILX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerLGILX finds itself in the Schwab Funds family, based out of San Francisco, CA. Since Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund made its debut in July of 2009, LGILX has garnered more than $1.88 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Phil Ruvinsky who has been in charge of the fund since July of 2020.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.7%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 5.72%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, LGILX's standard deviation comes in at 23.11%, compared to the category average of 21.58%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 22.26% compared to the category average of 21.42%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 1.1, so investors should note that it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. LGILX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -1.79, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsInvestigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.Currently, this mutual fund is holding 90.12% in stocks and it has 10.91% of assets in foreign securities. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyRetail TradeTurnover is 49%, which means this fund makes fewer trades than comparable funds.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, LGILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% compared to the category average of 0.99%. From a cost perspective, LGILX is actually cheaper than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund ( LGILX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

The stock, which is down 32% year-to-date, ended the session at $56.46.Charles Schwab is among brokerages and other financial firms, including State Street, Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon, that have been facing a sharp drop in customer deposits and an uptick in unrealized fixed-income asset losses since the U.S. Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates last year.While higher rates have helped Charles Schwab and other firms earn more from interest income, the drop in deposits have drained them of a cheap source of funding, forcing them to raise new capital or cut costs.The yield on the benchmark 10-year note reached 4.366% on Tuesday, a high last seen in November 2007. Yields move inversely to bond prices, meaning the value of Treasuries held by banks on their balance sheets has fallen.""We believe the stock has declined in recent days partly from the overall pullback in the stock market and potentially from the higher 10-year Treasury rate,"" Morningstar analyst Michael Wong said in an investor note.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

For more information, see TI.com/TMCS1123 and TI.com/EZShunt.""When choosing a current-sensing solution, design engineers weigh the trade-offs of four key factors: cost, size, accuracy and speed,"" said Jason Cole, business unit manager. ""These new products highlight how the breadth of our sensing technologies address this design challenge for a variety of systems. Take the TMCS1123, for example; its high accuracy and low propagation delay enable designers to now use Hall-effect sensors in high-voltage systems where they couldn't before – and that opens the door to reduce system cost and size.""Achieve fast, accurate control in high-voltage systems with Hall-effect current sensorsThe need for highly accurate current measurements in high-voltage systems such as electric vehicle chargers and solar inverters is growing, but Hall-effect current sensors have typically been overlooked given their high drift over lifetime. The TMCS1123 Hall-effect current sensor features the highest reinforced isolation working voltage of 1,100 VDC. The TMCS1123 also features a maximum sensitivity error of ±0.75% with 50 ppm/°C drift over temperature and ±0.5% drift over lifetime. With this high accuracy, the TMCS1123 enables designers to optimize system performance while simplifying design. The high precision and stability over lifetime remove the need to recalibrate equipment, reducing costly and time-consuming maintenance.Story continuesIn addition, achieving precise control of power conversion is paramount for optimizing system efficiency and protection. The TMCS1123 features low propagation delay of 600 ns and bandwidth of 250 kHz, which enable faster control loops while keeping noise low to help increase system efficiency.

13,24d906ed-07e5-3bf9-b9c6-20f5ab6886ba,PVH,2023-08-23,Earnings Preview: PVH (PVH) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-pvh-pvh-q2-212856492.html,1692739736,STORY,['PVH'],"[The market expects PVH (PVH) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.19 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PVH?For PVH, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.27%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PVH will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PVH would post earnings of $1.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.14, delivering a surprise of +10.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PVH doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PVH, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PVH Corp is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PVH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.73 per share for PAGS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PVH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of -1.27% heading into earnings season.PVH Corp. Price and EPS SurprisePVH Corp. Price and EPS SurprisePVH Corp. price-eps-surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

It leads to an average weight loss of around 15%, alongside changes to diet and exercise.In May, Knudsen said a third plant would start producing later this year and he hoped to add more sites. He did not identify the third partner.Catalent's factory in Brussels that fills Wegovy pens has repeatedly breached U.S. sterile-safety rules in recent years and staff have failed to perform required quality checks, Reuters reported last month.It is not clear how much the factories are producing.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Cintas The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CintasOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Officer, Michael Thompson, for US$6.6m worth of shares, at about US$445 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$486. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 18% of Michael Thompson's holding. Michael Thompson was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of CintasAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Cintas insiders own about US$7.4b worth of shares (which is 15% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Cintas Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Cintas, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Cintas has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.But note: Cintas may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

""If you think about where we are today, we had record revenue of $8.8 billion in fiscal 2023, our market cap is approaching $50 billion. I’d like to thank our customers for their confidence in us and allowing us to help them get ready for the workday, every single day. And I’d like to thank our 44,000 employee-partners for their hard work and dedication in taking incredibly good care of our valued customers. Without our employee-partners we wouldn’t have a business and I am grateful for all they do every day.""After the bell ringing, the group moved outside where the exchange’s video tower was lit to celebrate Cintas’ anniversary and where Times Square had been transformed for a special Cintas fashion show. Twenty models stepped out from a Cintas electric delivery vehicle and displayed a variety of the company’s workwear styles, including looks from exclusive rental partners Carhartt and Chef Works.Story continuesCintas Executive Vice President and CFO, Mike Hansen reflected on Cintas amazing progress.""Forty years is a great achievement for us,"" Hansen said. ""We’ve raised our dividend every year since we went public. We’ve grown our sales and profits for 52 out of the last 54 years, and we finished fiscal 2023 with 12% organic growth and margin improvement, so there’s a lot to be excited about for Cintas employee-partners.""In 1983 when Cintas went public, its initial public stock offering price was $0.94 after stock splits. On Friday, its stock price closed at $485.44.In its fiscal year 1984 – the year of its IPO – Cintas posted revenues of $63 million, profits of $5.5 million and had a market capitalization of almost $111 million. In fiscal year 2023 – Cintas’ most recent full fiscal year which ended on May 31 – the company recorded $8.8 billion in revenue and profits of $1.8 billion. On Friday, Cintas’ market capitalization was just under $50 billion.Cintas delivered its very first dividend the year it went public and has increased the shareholder payout every year since – including a 17% increase in fiscal year 2023 over its fiscal year 2022 dividend.""Coming out to New York to celebrate our 40th anniversary as a public company has been a great opportunity to reflect on our business and appreciate all the hard work that’s gone into making our company so successful,"" Schneider said. ""Our 44,000 employee-partners embrace our culture of performance, innovation and continual improvement and they are deeply committed to serving our customers every day. That commitment has helped us become the largest rental workwear provider in the United States, the largest van-delivered first aid and safety provider in the U.S., and one of the largest providers of fire protection services in the country.

If you want to skip our introduction to insider trading and Mr. Fisher then skip to Ken Fisher's and Insiders' 5 Stock Picks.Insider trading is often thought to be illegal. The most commonly understood definition of insider trading, and one that is also against the law, is trading the shares of a firm based on non publicly available information. As an example, if your uncle worked at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and he told you that during its upcoming earnings call the firm will announce a shut down of U.S. manufacturing, and you used this information to buy Put options before the earnings to profit from a drop in the share price, then this would be insider trading. Depending on the scale of your trade, the SEC might fine you and your uncle or even send you to jail.However, another variety of insider trading is legal. This involves the purchasing or selling of a firm's shares by its management or large investors, and the transactions are reported on a publicly traded firm's SEC page and the purchases are often evaluated by investors to gauge what these people, which generally have a deeper insight into the firm's operations, are thinking about their company. At the same time, management, and particularly top level executives such as chief executive officers also buy shares to project their confidence in their firm's prospects to potentially assuage any large investor concerns that might be present.The lucrative nature of the stock market and the potential it offers to make millions means that even though insider trading is illegal, it will most likely never go away. It continues to generate headlines in the media, and recently, one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading companies in the world is finding itself on its web. This firm is none other than the embattled cryptocurrency trading platform Binance, whose chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has stopped all Binance employees from engaging in any form of futures trading. Additionally, the company has a new policy in place that now require employees from holding their investments for at least 90 days, which is aimed to stop them from profiteering in the short term on the basis of information that might be unavailable to the broader public.Story continuesAt the same time, while Binance might not be facing any legal action against insider trading, one publicly traded firm that is facing an insider trading lawsuit is Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG). The growth in online learning after the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the demand for such platforms, and at the same time, it has also allowed unscrupulous students to cheat on their tests or use other unfair advantages to distort their academic results. This has landed the CEO of San Francisco 49ers Mr. Jed York at the center of a lawsuit against Chegg which claims that not only did the company profit from college students using it to cheat on their exams, but that Mr. York and other directors sold stock while the shares were at their peak without informing investors about the scale of the fraud that was being conducted through Chegg. The company's shares were trading at $113 in February 2021 when online education was at its peak but then lost their luster as in person classes resumed. Mr. York is accused of making a cool $1.4 million from inflated share prices, and for its part, Chegg has denied any wrongdoing as it claims that it is ""vigorously defending itself"" from the allegations.While insider purchases provide one way to determine if a stock might appreciate in the future, another popular method of sifting through the thousands of companies on the stock market is by taking a look at what hedge funds are doing. After all, these are professionals who spend most of their day pouring over anything and everything related to the stock market, so their decision carry a lot of weight as well. One of the most successful hedge fund investors of all time is the billionaire founder of Fisher Investments Mr. Ken Fisher. Having spent decades on the stock market, Mr. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, and he often has remarkable insights into the market that are based purely on the key determinants of market health such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth instead of the chatter that often clouds the truth behind what can take place in the future. He was one of the few investors that was actually bullish last year, and we all know how that played out as markets stunned everyone in 2023 to produce double digit returns. So naturally, his words have a lot of weight to them, and as to what he thinks will happen in the future, here's a glimpse inside his mind about the rest of the year:Let me just say that all these sentiment features lead to pessimism. And as a bull market begins, there's this feature that I've talked about before that I call the Pessimism of Disbelief, which is the tendency of people to get more pessimistic as the market starts to go up. Where maybe we had a bottom in June, the middle of June, on June 14. Maybe we had a bottom, depending on how you measure it, which indexes you look at in July, the stocks are higher either way. And when you think about these things, it is normal. I'm not saying those were the bottom. I don't really know.But it is normal when you have a bear market make a bottom and start to go up for people to keep getting more pessimistic as it goes up. The pessimism leads to future positive surprise which becomes doubly bullish fully buoying the bull market.And you should view today's sentiment as the precursor to higher prices ahead without any precise timing of whether we've had the bottom, the bottom still a little bit ahead. What's going on? That negative sentiment is not consistent with a world that's about to fall apart. It's more consistent with a world that's already seen its stock market bottom and is starting to rise and the Pessimism of Disbelief builds.So, you get yes buts to all positivity, all new things that come along better than people feared as people keep looking for the bad that looking for the bad is a good. And you should view sentiment in that way because negative sentiment is one of the most bullish features you can get.So, we decided to take a look at some stocks that are both the top picks of Ken Fisher and have seen insider activity lately. The top picks are The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Adobe Inc.

27,3d0a19c3-bf2c-4dfc-86dd-36ae27488b75,JWN,2023-08-23,Macy's big warning on credit cards a big problem for some other retailers,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-big-warning-on-credit-cards-a-big-problem-for-some-other-retailers-120410076.html,1692792250,STORY,"['JWN', 'KSS', 'M']","[A warning on the health of US consumers by America's department store is likely sending quakes through the C-suites of similar retailers.And investors in retail stocks need to pay attention because there could be aftershocks.On Tuesday, Macy's (M) said its second quarter credit card sales tanked 36% from the prior year to $150 million. The culprit: Bloated balances on Macy's Citibank-powered credit card have been met with a rising interest rate environment.In turn, cash-strapped consumers — enduring an almost 32% annual percentage interest rate on the Macy's card — haven't been able to pay off their bills. Macy's has opted to write off those balances.""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with Wall Street. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Execs added that it's seeing the most acute pressure among households earning $75,000 and under.Year to date, Macy's credit card sales are down about 24% from a year ago.Macy's stock was slammed 14% on the warning, justifiably so.The credit card business has long been a pure profit center for a retailer like Macy's.Per data from Citi analyst Paul Lejuez, Macy's credit card business hauled in $863 million in sales last year — up about 12% from 2019. While that made up 3.5% of Macy's sales in 2022, it comprised an even larger percentage of operating profits.A significant percentage, to be precise.Lejuez's math pegs Macy's credit card business representing 49% of its operating profits in 2022, up from 35% in 2021. Pre-pandemic in 2019, the business made up 58% of Macy's operating profits.""2Q results highlight the challenges to Macy's traffic/sales, but inventory is in better shape and expenses have been well managed,"" Lejuez wrote. ""The more concerning issue this quarter is the more rapid-than-expected decline in credit income, which comprised ~50% of Macy's operating profits last year, and historically has been a cushion to EBIT as the retail business weakened.""Story continuesA woman holds a Macy's card in New Orleans. (Jenny Kane/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)With this profit center now under severe pressure due to consumers running out of money at month's end, it's no surprise investors have moved to rerate Macy's stock.And they have begun to do the same at Macy's rivals.Credit card sales made up 87% of operating profits at high-end department store Nordstrom (JWN) in 2022, according to Lejuez's data. In 2021, that number was 79%. Nordstrom's stock plunged 10% on Tuesday in sympathy to Macy's dreary commentary.Credit card sales generated the majority of operating profits at Kohl's (KSS) in 2022. Shares of Kohl's cratered 10.3% during the session.""Credit is also a significant contributor to EBIT at peers JWN/KSS,"" Lejuez added. ""We believe challenges in credit (higher delinquencies/bad debt) could lead retailers to pull back on who they extend credit to. Those that do could see a sales hit, and this may drive more consumers to trade down to off-pricers. Faster-than-expected deterioration in credit highlights the challenges facing the consumer (which we view as bad news for sales/margins across retail).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But some Fed officials have said they still need to get inflation down to their 2% target, and that rates would have to stay higher until that is accomplished.Macy's (NYSE:M) offered a cautious outlook for the full year, with same-store sales expected to drop despite the holiday season that is quickly approaching. More department stores, including Kohl's and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) are due to report later this week.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1.

In her research, Naomi Park has developed a method to simultaneously remove these contaminants.For this, she was announced the winner of Stockholm Junior Water Prize, an international competition where students between the ages of 15 and 20 present solutions to major water challenges.Speaking on winning the prize, Park said: ""I did this project in my high school. I joined our research program as a freshman. It is just something that I wanted to do for fun. I never realized that I would get to this point. It is very much a shock right now.""The Jury noted that ""the winner is taking a troublesome waste product and using it to help solve a number of the most pressing issues we face in the modern world. By using Styrofoam and creating a ‘sponge’ that absorbs both carbon dioxide and oil products from the ocean, this student built a model and tested it – in multiple conditions, even simulating ocean waves – with impressive results.""The winner was presented with her prize during an award ceremony at World Water Week by HRH Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, the Prize’s Official Patron.The Diploma of Excellence was awarded to Ayse Pelin Dedeler from Türkiye for her study on how to capture microplastics with magnetic nano-adsorbents and remove them from the water using strong magnets.The People’s Choice Award went to Fernando de Silva Hernández and Carlos Erquizio from Mexico, completing the line-up of winners.Story continuesThe Stockholm Junior Water Prize has been organized every year since 1997 by the Stockholm International Water Institute, SIWI, with Xylem as Founding Partner.""The Stockholm Junior Water Prize is a tribute to an entire generation of motivated young people, eager to tackle the greatest challenges of our time. Their passion, ingenuity, and determination to be part of a better future is truly inspiring. It is also a stark reminder that we must all do our part, and we must do it now,"" said Karin Gardes, Acting Executive Director of Stockholm International Water Institute.Patrick Decker, Xylem’s President and CEO, added: ""The next generation of water innovators is already making a difference today – as all the Stockholm Junior Water Prize participants show. I join 22,000 Xylem colleagues and our many partners around the world in honoring their big ideas and bold ambitions. We’re inspired by what’s to come and welcome them to the global movement to solve water.""For more information: www.siwi.org/prizes.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230822895510/en/ContactsJakob SchabusCommunications ManagerStockholm International Water InstituteEmail: jakob.schabus@siwi.org Mobile: +46 (0) 720 50 60 39]"

MET currently has a market cap of $46.8 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan It Retain Momentum?The answer is yes, thanks to rising estimates, growing operating strength and its cost-curbing initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $7.78 per share, indicating a 13.6% rise from $6.85 a year ago. Over the past week, it witnessed two upward estimate revisions against none in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the same twice.MetLife has undertaken several strategies to control costs and increase efficiency. Our estimate for adjusted total expenses for 2023 indicates a 7.4% year-over-year decline, which will aid its margins. The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $70.9 billion.Despite decreased real estate equity returns, MetLife’s adjusted net investment income is on the rise. The metric jumped 12% year over year to $5,040 million in the second quarter. Earlier, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stated that it expects pre-tax variable investment income to be around $2 billion for this year.Its strong operations in international markets like Asia and Latin America position the company for long-term growth. We expect adjusted net income growth from both these businesses to be positive this year, which will support its overall performance.MET remains in sound financial health, with enough cash on hand and a very manageable debt. At the second-quarter end, it had cash and cash equivalents of $15,417 million, significantly higher than its short-term debt of $200 million. Also, it generated free cash flows of $11.9 billion in the trailing 12-month period. With growing operating strength, the figure is expected to rise in the future.Story continuesRisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that can hold back MET’s growth. Unfavorable underwriting margins in the Group Benefits business and declining premiums from MetLife Holdings are some of the headwinds faced by the company lately. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader finance space are Trupanion, Inc.

The recognition of the gain would then be deferred until Dec. 31, 2026 (implying payment of the tax by April 15, 2027), or until the sale of the QOF, whichever occurred first.Even better, if the taxpayer chooses to hold their QOF investment for at least 10 years, the cost basis for the QOF would increase to its fair market value upon sale of the fund — thereby rendering the investment free of all capital gains taxes at the time of sale. Most investors consider the tax deferral to be the smaller of the benefits, with the largest benefit by far being the tax-free nature of the QOZ investment. Many are calling this important piece of tax legislation one of the greatest tax benefits in decades, and understandably so as billions of investment dollars have poured into QOFs over the past three years alone.Story continuesThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) appears to have achieved its objective of affording investors the chance to defer capital gains taxes for at least a few years, while simultaneously presenting the opportunity for an investment permanently free of all capital gains tax, provided the 10-year minimum holding period was respected. With over 8,700 opportunity zones as possible targets for investment, and with significant numbers of investors moving capital into QOZs, the objective of job creation within those zones is being realized.Astute investors have sifted through the various QOZ investment offerings that include multifamily apartments, self-storage and other various asset classes in commercial real estate. However, some investors also have learned that energy investments are being made in QOZs.Let’s focus on one of the more appealing and lesser-understood offerings available for QOZ investors: the energy sector.The energy sector is broadly understood to include two classes within the sector that include fossil fuels (oil and petroleum, gasoline, natural gas and diesel) and renewable, which would encompass solar, wind, hydropower and biomass. As we delve into the possibilities within the energy markets, it becomes clear that QOZ investing may be particularly well structured to accommodate energy investments in oil and gas production.Many designated QOZs are located in areas renowned for energy production and are conducive to QOF investment projects, especially within the oil and gas exploration and production sectors. These projects include upstream activities (drilling and exploring for oil and operating wells), midstream activities (storing and transporting crude oil and natural gas) and downstream activities (converting crude oil and raw natural gas into products consumers and businesses need).A few QOFs already exist in well-established energy production areas of the country. These include the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford in Texas, the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and East Texas, and the Marcellus Formation in Pennsylvania.Synergies between oil and gas and QOF structureBeyond the obvious synergies between the oil and gas industry and the QOF structure, the most compelling reason to contemplate an oil and gas QOF investment right now is the state of the industry itself, which is facing any number of headwinds in the eye of the public and therefore may be ripe for new investments at a reasonable price.COVID-19 depressed valuations of virtually every oil-and-gas-related asset, including mineral and royalty interests, and while those prices are off their bottoms, they remain far off their peak valuations.The oil and gas industry remains the preferred villain of certain quarters of the investment world, whose infatuation with ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) and concern with the effects of climate change have tempered any enthusiasm for energy investment.Large swaths of the automotive industry have proclaimed their intention to exclusively produce electric vehicles within the next several decades, proclaiming for all intents and purposes the death of the internal combustion engine. New York state even banned the use of gas stoves in newly constructed buildings!Some investors feel that it may be time to summon up one of Warren Buffett’s best-known investment credos, which is to ""be greedy when all those around us are fearful.""Electric vehicles are increasing in popularity, but we are learning more and more about the rare metals required to build EVs and the surge in mining activity that will be required to convert the world, or even the country, into an all-EV nirvana. We’re already aware of how the electricity required to power these EVs is produced around most of the world: in coal-fired power plants and with oil and gas. In short, EVs may well be the wave of the future, but they may not be as ""green"" as many consider them to be. As of 2021, just 3% of U.S. automobile sales were EVs, with only a 5% increase in 2022, according to J.D. Power.Similarly, while climate change is a legitimate concern, the notion that we can respond as a society by immediately weaning ourselves off petroleum products and embracing an all-green power grid seems fanciful. Such a transition will take generations, if it happens at all.It's also important to note that we may well indeed be in a ""golden age"" of technology within the oil and gas industry that has given the United States the ability to transform from a net importer to a net exporter of energy, and of course that will depend largely on who's in the White House at any given time. Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is the tip of the iceberg of these technological revolutions, which have also included horizontal drilling and increased use of automation and digital technology in oilfield production.Dependency on oil and gas for the time beingThe fact remains that the world remains dependent on oil and gas for the standard of living to which we’ve all become accustomed, and ""green energy"" initiatives are still in their infancy, despite all of our concentrated efforts to shift toward renewable energy. Fossil fuels, including oil and gas, are unlikely to go the way of the dinosaur any time soon, and certainly not in the next 10 to 20 years.The smart money may be on their continued presence in the American and global marketplace. The even smarter money may find investment dollars flowing into oil and gas QOFs, where the tax advantages are considered a generational opportunity, and where the 10-year prognosis for the investment and energy sector itself looks promising.Requirements for qualified opportunity fundsConsider the requirements for all QOFs, regardless of the trade or business in question: Any investment funds received by a QOF must be put to use within six months of receipt.The QOF must hold at least 90% of its assets in the form of a QOZ property, whether that be in the form of business property, corporate stock, or partnership interests.For business property in a QOZ, the property must meet three important requirements: 1) it must be tangible property used in a trade or business; 2) it must be purchased from an unrelated party; and 3) it must either be an “original use” property, beginning with the QOF, or an existing property that is “substantially improved” within 30 months of acquisition.QOZs dovetail nicely with the kinds of investments that help an investor further diversify their portfolio, but that also come with a unique and strategic set of tax and wealth creation benefits for everyday investors seeking shelter from capital gains taxes.Understanding the big picture is important, but choosing the right investment is even more critical. Not all QOZ funds are created equal, and it’s essential to do your homework before committing your investment dollars into any QOZ investment.

So far, oil loadings from Russia's Black Sea ports have not been affected by the attacks, but risks are mounting, traders said.The war risk premium was increased from around 1% of the cargo's cost to some 1.20-1.25%, the traders said.The increase means every voyage will cost $200,000 per one Suezmax tanker (can carry 120,000-200,000 tonnes) more if Russian oil is delivered to India. The rise in the premium means the overall cost of the premium will be almost $1 million.Although the sum is not huge it adds to Russia's overall oil export costs, which have soared since February 2022 due to sanctions.At the peak of Russian supply and sanctions crisis Russian companies were paying as much as $20 million per tanker towards insurance shipping and freight costs representing more than a third of each cargo's value.Traders added the increase was mostly applied to cargoes carrying Russian oil and products, while the premium of cargoes carrying Kazakh origin volumes was generally stable around 1%.""Volumes originated from Russia are associated with higher risks than others, though current situation gives insurers lots of reason to raise prices for anyone operating in Russian Black Sea ports,"" one of the traders said.Grain traders have expressed concerns about the security of grains shipments and the rise in war risk premium for oil tankers shows the worries have spread to wider markets.Overall crude oil loadings from Black Sea Novorossiisk and CPC terminal account for some 2% of global supply. Oil product exports from Russia's Black Sea ports is about 4 million tonnes per year.(Reporting by Reuters; editing by David Evans)]"

WTI hit a one-month low at $77.62 earlier. The U.S. crude benchmark is down some 2.3% week-to-date, after shedding an identical percentage last week following a seven-week rally that left WTI up nearly 20%.Brent settled down 82 cents, or almost 1%, at $83.21 per barrel. The global crude benchmark was down nearly 2% on the week, extending last week’s 3% drop after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.Oil prices dipped for a third day in a row despite the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, saying in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that crude stockpiles fell by 6.135M barrels during the week ended Aug. 18.The crude stockpile drop came on top of the 5.960M-barrel decline reported by the EIA for inventories in the prior week to Aug. 11. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a decline of just 2.850M barrels for the just-ended week.Upstaging the crude inventory decline were U.S. gasoline inventories, which registered a surprise build last week against expectations for a drop. Stockpiles of distillates, meanwhile, jumped four times more than forecast, the EIA said.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA reported a build of 1.467M barrels, after a slide of 0.261M barrels last week. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.888M for last week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a climb of 0.945M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.296M. Analysts had predicted a build of just 0.218M for last week. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.The EIA’s reports on oil and fuel inventories have turned volatile lately as global stockpiles see shifts from Saudi and Russian maneuvers to slash exports amid slower buying from China.Story continuesU.S. crude output at 3-year highAlso, quite unexpected was the EIA’s higher estimate for U.S. crude output for a third week running.Crude output was projected at 12.8M barrels per day during the week to Aug. 18, making it the agency’s highest such estimate since the record 13.1M barrels produced daily before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.Over the past three weeks, the EIA has constantly raised production estimates for oil by 100,000 barrels each week under a new reporting methodology that accounts for oil potentially flowing from active oil wells compared with those that are drilled but uncompleted — the latter referred to as DUCs.“Earlier this year the EIA revised the number of drilled but uncompleted wells in the top U.S. shale basin, adding several years’ worth of unreported DUCs,” said Phil Flynn, an energy analyst at Chicago broker Price Futures Group.Flynn said the revisions imply that drilling-rig productivity has been higher than past estimates despite the U.S. oil rig count having fallen by more than 15% this year.The EIA “believes active drilling rigs were about 10% more productive in 2021–2022 than previously estimated”, Flynn added.The revisions to the EIA’s reports also come as global oil supply sees shifts from Saudi and Russian efforts to slash production and exports amid slower buying by top oil importer China which is facing an economic crunch.U.S. export escalationHigher drilling efficiency aside, U.S. oil producers also seem to be pushing for volume now. There has been a sheer escalation in exports from the world’s largest producer of the commodity, ostensibly to feed demand coming from markets that could be underserved by the Saudi-Russian cuts.The EIA report for the week ended August 18 also showed a staggering 10.544M barrels per day of exports of both crude and fuel oils from a total crude production of 12.8M. That means just 2.256M barrels of crude per day were for domestic consumption, with the balance 82% going towards exports.“It looks like U.S. energy companies are really stepping up to the plate to ostensibly make up for some of the vacuum in oil supplies resulting from the Saudi-Russian cuts,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Saudi Arabia, which has been producing oil at well below its capacity for more than a year now, announced an additional million barrels per day reduction in July that it said will carry through to September at least. Cargo tracking data by Kpler also suggests that Russian exports may fall by as much as one million barrels per day this month as the Kremlin seeks to tighten production.(Additional reporting by Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick)Related ArticlesOil prices dip as U.S. fuel demand disappoints; Crude output at 3-year highGold settles above $1,900 first time in 2 weeks as dollar, yields coolOil edges down as demand woes outweighs big draw in crude stocks]"

China's economic woes means the country could consume less oil, which could result in lower prices. If oil prices come down, so could gasoline prices. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman explains a new Eurasia Group report and what's driving oil prices right now.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: China's economy is in trouble, and that could have broader implications for the oil market. Crude prices hovering just around 80 bucks a barrel, as worry over the country struggling recovery dims outlook for demand. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman. So Rick, what does this mean for oil prices? Are they headed lower?RICK NEWMAN: Hey, guys. I hope so. That could be the case. What's going on in China with the softening economy, the collapse of the real estate market there. They've got all sorts of problems.China does not at all look like the economic superpower in the making that a lot of people have thought it was during the last 20 years. And every time I see that there are problems in the Chinese economy, what that means is China is such a big purchaser of oil that when the Chinese economy softens, that means China's oil purchases generally flatten out, or even decline. That is actually happening now. And China is such a big player in the market that when their demand goes down, it's relief for everybody else who purchases oil.That is a pretty important story right now because we've seen oil prices, and also gasoline prices here, rising. We've got oil in the United States at around 80 bucks a barrel. Gasoline prices are around $3.85 a gallon. I think when gasoline prices cross into $4, and there's a four at the beginning of that price, I think that freaks out drivers.That's a big problem for President Biden, if that were to happen. Of course, the timing for him would be bad, if we got $4 gas just as he's mounting his reelection campaign. So global oil markets are complex. There are a lot of factors. But when China stumbles, and its economy slows down, that usually means we're going to get a brake on oil and gasoline prices.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Rick, how long could that break potentially last here? We're talking about the [? pack. ?] And you mentioned, obviously, it could be a huge break for President Biden if we do see gas prices lower. We know that's such an important issue here for voters. But when we talk about maybe the longer term effects of that, any idea of what that would look like?RICK NEWMAN: I mean, there's a lot going on in global energy markets, with-- part of it is the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has basically reshaped global energy flows. We, of course, have the move to green energy here in the United States and elsewhere. I guess I'd break it down into three things, if you're looking at, let's say, a 12-month outlook.First, China's economy is not likely to recover any time soon. They have been through many slowdowns, and they've been able to stimulate their way out of almost all of them for the last 25 years. This one seems different.There really are underlying problems. Way too much debt in the Chinese economy. And that seems like it's likely to weigh down the Chinese economy for some time, think years rather than months. So that's good for falling oil prices.You've also got OPEC and OPEC+ including Russia. It's part of that broader OPEC+. They're trying to cut back on their supplies, because they want to keep prices up. We've talked a lot before about Saudi Arabia drilling a little bit less. Russia's probably removing some oil from the market.And then, the third big factor, US production. I mean, people think we don't drill that much oil in the United States anymore. We actually drill a ton of oil, and the United States is now the world's biggest oil producer. And it looks as if we are going to hit new record highs for oil production here in the United States.It's not shooting up. It's inching up. But what's happened here is as oil prices stay elevated, drillers look at the market. And they say, OK, we can make good profits at these prices. $60, $70, $80, or even higher.So we're seeing an increase in US production. So all of those things combined are hopefully favorable for fairly ample supply. We've seen tight energy supplies the last couple of years. But that could ease for all those reasons.SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, we will see. Oil closing today, just above 80 bucks a barrel. Rick, thanks.]"

We have also covered key trends and companies related to data. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Data Scientists.How Important is Data?They say data is the new oil and rightly so because data has permeated and tweaked every corner of our lives, much like a secret ingredient in a recipe that works wonders. It's the powerhouse behind industries today, enabling tasks after tasks to facilitate and empower humans. Just as oil fueled the past industrial revolutions, data drives today's digital age by bringing innovation, strategic decisions, and operational efficiency.Similar to oil refining, data undergoes extraction, processing, and application phases. Unlike oil, however, data's potential is boundless, that inspires breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT) and deep learning. To read more about deep learning, do check out our article on deep learning courses for high salary jobs. Are Data Jobs Still in Demand in 2023?While data scientist was the sexiest job of 2021, the job of a data scientist is not only one of the most needed jobs in America in 2023, but also one of the most in-demand jobs for the future with a growth rate of 36% between 2021 and 2031. It is also worth noting that technology, finance, and healthcare are the highest paying industries for data scientists. However, utilization of data is not restricted to data scientists' jobs alone. In the dynamic media landscape today, the importance and subsequent rise of data in journalism has undergone an equally profound transformation, which has shaped the way news is produced and consumed. Just as the Guardian's Datablog heralded a new era of data-driven journalism, we witness today an incredible shift towards data's pivotal role in reinforcing trust and combating misinformation.Story continuesData journalism has evolved into a formidable weapon against misinformation, rooted in the ethos of credible sources and transparent reporting. This pronounced transformation can be attributed to the pandemic when governments started banning fake news through the proliferation of laws against disinformation and only statistically rooted, direct information was prioritized. The accurate data-driven reporting not only informs the public during crises but also safeguards journalism's integrity in a cacophony of online voices. The metamorphosis of journalism into the 2020s underscores the symbiotic relationship between data and news that enables nuanced insights, fact-checking, and credible reporting that resonate with audiences.Key Trends and Companies in Data in 2023Data democratization is a key trend in 2023, which empowers entire workforces to utilize analytics, not just data experts.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Align Technology sees a huge untapped potential for Invisalign Clear Aligner in the global malocclusion treatment space. Per a Grand View Research report, the global clear aligners market was valued at $4.1 billion in 2022 and is projected to witness a CAGR of 30.1% by 2030. Till the end of 2022, over 14 million people worldwide were treated with the Invisalign System. During the second quarter, in the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners.Further, Align Technology is expanding its sales and marketing by reaching new countries and regions, including new areas within Africa and Latin America. Till the end of 2022, the company sold directly or through authorized distributors in more than 100 countries. With the opening of its third clear aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, the company now has a manufacturing facility in each of its operating territories — Americas (Mexico), APAC (China) and EMEA (Poland).Align Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. price | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteAdded to this, Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. In the Americas, Align Technology is focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through influencer and creator-centric campaigns, partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw and Jeremy Lin in 2023. Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners.On the flip side, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor costs, freight charges, and rising interest rate have put the dental treatment space (which is highly-elective) in a tight spot. Added to this, Align Technology is also concerned about the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that is likely to continue in 2023.Story continuesAll these are creating significant pressure on the company’s operating profit. During the last-reported second quarter of 2023, Align Technology witnessed a 6.3% increase in SG&amp;A expenses and a 21.3% rise in R&amp;D expenses.

Nvidia’s processors are the picks and shovels in the AI gold-rush that has fueled markets this year, making its report much more significant than a typical earnings release.“What Nvidia says about guidance for the remainder of FY24 drives the sentiment around the entire AI thesis that has driven the market,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Melius Research.The chipmaker’s Wall Street cheerleaders are expecting more good news.Analysts have been raising price targets ahead of the second-quarter report, which is expected to show revenue up 65% from the same period a year ago to about $11 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. According to Citigroup, expectations from institutional investors are even higher, at around $12 billion.And many analysts, like HSBC’s Frank Lee, say the stock has further to run — despite more than tripling this year to trade at a whopping 44 times projected profits.“Although market expectations have clearly risen for Nvidia and the overall AI supply chain, we expect bullish AI server momentum continued to surpass market expectations,” Lee wrote in a research note on Monday, arguing that the long-term earnings potential still isn’t reflected by Nvidia’s stock price.Story continuesAs one of just a handful of companies worth more than $1 trillion, Nvidia’s share-price move after earnings has the potential to take the entire S&amp;P 500 with it. Options market activity is implying a 10% swing in the stock price on the day after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On Wednesday, the stock gained as much as 2.8%.Inevitably, other stocks exposed to AI — heavyweights like Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. and smaller companies like Palantir Technologies Inc. — will see the biggest impact. But the report is important for markets outside the US — for stocks like Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and chip equipment giant ASML Holding NV.With expectations so high, a disappointment would hit hard.“If they miss, the entire stock market’s gonna go down,” Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, said in an interview. “There’s no question about that.”One wildcard is supply. Some on Wall Street are warning that sales might be limited by Nvidia’s ability to secure enough chips from TSMC. Still, most don’t see it being a problem for the stock if forecasts are good, because those sales would be pushed into subsequent quarters.For the broader market, facing headwinds including higher interest rates and an economic slowdown, a positive report may help to reassure that AI has game-changing potential to boost productivity and profits in many industries. Strategists at Goldman Sachs this week introduced an “AI trade after the trade” basket — stocks with the largest potential long-term earnings boost from the impact of AI on labor productivity.Earnings for the median stock in that basket could be 72% higher than the current baseline following widespread AI adoption, strategists led by Ryan Hammond wrote in a note.But Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson — a stalwart equity bear — cautioned that souring sentiment about the macroeconomic backdrop means that even blowout results may not be enough to propel markets higher this time.“We don’t think outstanding results from Nvidia will change the complexion of the more recent price action for the other derivative plays or for the broader market in the way it did in May,” he wrote.Tech Chart of the DaySaudi Aramco is narrowing the gap with Microsoft Corp. for the title of the world’s second-most valuable company. Aramco shares have risen 6% this month as crude prices surged from June lows, propelling the oil giant’s market capitalization to $2.2 trillion. Meanwhile, the Windows software maker is on track for a second month of declines after reporting tepid quarterly sales growth. Microsoft’s market value was $2.4 trillion as of Tuesday’s close.Top Tech StoriesThe leading association of global chip companies is warning that Huawei Technologies Co. is building a collection of secret semiconductor-fabrication facilities across China, a shadow manufacturing network that would let the blacklisted company skirt US sanctions and further the nation’s technology ambitions.Cathie Wood bought more of Zoom Video Communications Inc. as the stock fell Tuesday in the wake of the video-conferencing company’s results.Snap Inc. is appointing a former Google executive to lead its India operations as it strives to become a major social media force in a key growth market.Veteran trial lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, had 10 days to save Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., the biggest gaming deal ever.Earnings Due WednesdayPremarketAnalog DevicesPelotonPostmarketNvidiaSnowflakeAutodeskSplunkNetApp--With assistance from Ian King, Alexandra Semenova, Subrat Patnaik and Jan-Patrick Barnert.(Updates stock move in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNigeria’s Train to Nowhere Shows How Not to Build Public TransitThe Next Wave of Scams Will Be Deepfake Video Calls From Your BossA Fragile Real Estate Boom Emerges Under Israeli OccupationStock Pickers Never Had a Chance Against Hard Math of the MarketLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) Here©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Nvidia’s powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are well-suited for AI tasks like deep learning, data analysis, and complex computations. Because Nvidia’s AI offerings have positioned the company as a critical player in the AI ecosystem, the stock has ripped due to the ongoing “AI Revolution”. Below are 5 reasons the stock can continue higher into year-end:Robust Earnings HistoryOver the past 16 quarters, Nvidia delivered surprises in every quarter, except for two quarters in the middle of the 2022 bear market.In the past five quarters, Nvidia shares have moved by an average of +5.95% the day after NVDA earnings were reported. The options market implies a move of about 10% this quarter following the earnings release.Lofty but Attainable ExpectationsFrom a data perspective, NVDA enjoys a positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction Score). A positive ESP score means that NVDA has recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that the more recent the information is, the better the predictor of the future. The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. When you combine a Zacks Rank of #3 or better (NVDA is the best possible #1) with a positive earnings ESO, stocks produce a positive surprise 70% of the time.If Nvidia can meet or exceed expectations as I expect it will, the company is about to enter an exponential “hockey stick growth” phase.Story continuesScorching Growth Makes Up for Sky-high ValuationA bear argument against owning Nvidia is its forward p/e ratio of 59.94. However, amateur investors must understand that institutions pay a premium for growth. Last quarter, Nvidia raised its earnings expectations for this quarter to a mind-boggling $11 billion ($4 billion more than consensus estimates). Nvidia also has the rare combination or what I call “The Magic Elixir” that institutions look for which includes·      Liquidity (50 million shares traded a day)·      Innovation (the leader in chips used for AI)·      High-growth (this quarter, earnings are expected to grow 300% year-over-year)The AI Arms RaceMicrosoft and Alphabet are the early leaders in the AI “Chatbot” realm. However, the race to AI supremacy is in its infancy. In the past few weeks, rich countries like China and Saudi Arabia ordered millions worth of Nvidia chips. Though only a handful of companies will ultimately be the Chatbot leaders, many companies will try, which in itself is a positive for Nvidia. In other words, the “pot of gold” is so large that Nvidia will make a fortune selling the “picks” needed for AI. One company to watch is Chinese internet giant Baidu, who is looking to unveil a more powerful Chatbot than the popular ChatGPT.Relative StrengthObserving the price action of a stock relative to the market is one of the most powerful indicators of strength. From a relative strength perspective, NVDA sticks out like a sore thumb versus the market and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. NVDA shares are up 213% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF is only up 15%.Furthermore, NVDA notched all-time highs Tuesday (before fading), while the Nasdaq 100 ETFis off its 52-week high by 6%.Smart Money (Bonus)Because of their deep pockets, institutional investors are the “whales” that drive stocks higher. Stanley Druckenmiller and David Tepper are both billionaires who are considered some of the smartest money on Wall Street. In the latest 13F filing, Druckenmiller added 20% to his NVDA position, while Tepper increased his by 580%! NVDA is the top holding in both portfolios.ConclusionNvidia has everything an institutional investor looks for in a stock including, liquidity, growth, and groundbreaking innovation. While expectations are lofty for the stock, several data points suggest they are attainable. Look for NVDA shares to be higher 6-12 months from now.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

65,97b1e9e1-6988-3b7d-b8da-3f8d0dcbcea5,WBA,2023-08-23,A Disability Not Everyone Can See,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disability-not-everyone-see-133000089.html,1692711000.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Originally published by Walgreens Boots AllianceNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 22, 2023 / Some days, she can hold her baby and dance with him to music. On other days, she can barely lift her infant son.Sometimes she can handle simple tasks like grocery shopping and cooking, while other times she can't get out of bed and needs days of rest.This is how Alana Schreiber, 27, describes having a dynamic disability in a recent social media post. She explains that a dynamic disability means her symptoms are unpredictable, and the severity of those symptoms can change from day to day or even hour by hour.""Just because you see someone do something one day, doesn't mean they don't struggle with it at other times,"" she says.Schreiber's post specifically mentions Disability Pride Month, but she shares updates from her health journey year-round with more than 100,000 combined followers on Instagram and TikTok. Schreiber also shares tips and tricks she's learned along the way, including how Walgreens helps her stay on track.Discovering a diagnosisEven though she's dealt with health issues for most of her life, Schreiber didn't get any concrete diagnoses until a few years ago. She had frequent constipation and unexplained allergic reactions as a child. Then, chronic back and neck pain became an issue following a car accident when she was 12.""I spent my childhood and adolescence feeling othered and different,"" she says. Her inability to participate in sports or even a sleepover because of her chronic pain made her feel left out and alone.Schreiber continued to deal with erratic pain, nausea and headaches when she hit a breaking point in 2019. She had just started a new job when she ""lost the ability to eat.""Doctors couldn't figure out the problem and put her on anti-anxiety medications, which didn't help.""It was like I had a flu that just never went away,"" she says.Story continuesShe was in and out of the hospital for months until a tenacious gastroenterologist determined Schreiber had gastroparesis, a partial paralysis of the stomach. A few months after this diagnosis, she had her first feeding tube placed due to malnourishment.While trying to navigate living with gastroparesis, Schreiber eventually received two more diagnoses: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) as well as mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). POTS is a condition where a person gets headaches, fatigue and dizziness, among other things, when transitioning from lying down to standing up. MCAS is still a relatively unknown condition but occurs when a person experiences repeated episodes of anaphylaxis, or extreme allergy symptoms, without a clear cause.While her medication regimen keeps most of her symptoms in check, hormonal changes, stress and environmental factors-like something as small as exposure to a scented candle-can cause Schreiber's symptoms to bubble up.But she says there's a lot to be grateful for: being tube-free for a year and a half, getting pregnant and breastfeeding her baby, and sharing her journey with an online community that keeps her going.Online community sharing and supportSchreiber's friends initially encouraged her to share her health journey on social media, so when she did, she was surprised to learn that not many people knew about her conditions.""I realized how many people didn't know that you can look ‘normal' but still have a lot going on. I'm redefining how people think about chronic illness, disability and medical devices,"" she says. ""Then, I realized there's a community of people online who understand what I'm going through, too.""So it's a two-way street: Schreiber shares her health journey online and the community offers her support and education.""I've learned just so much about the disabled community and my illness community, and I feel like I'm learning to be a better person, too,"" she says.One thing she's recently shared with her followers is how the Walgreens app has helped her manage her conditions. From scheduling same-day delivery of her prescriptions to the medication reminder tool, she takes advantage of all the app's services.The app's Pharmacy Chat even helped Schreiber discover that an over-the-counter medication was causing a reaction with one of her daily prescriptions.""I was feeling nauseous and vomiting, and could not figure out what was going on,"" she says, and then decided on a whim to try Pharmacy Chat, a 24/7 online feature that allows patients to chat with a Walgreens pharmacy team member. After typing in the medications she was taking, the expert said one of her medications, when mixed with ibuprofen, could cause vomiting.""It saved me a call and a trip to my GI doctor,"" she says.So what's next for Schreiber? She's moving from Seattle back to California, her home state-something she's sure to update her followers on soon. To those who are struggling, Schreiber says to keep going and find joy where you can.""Living with a dynamic disability is a roller coaster. It's up and down, and can be really confusing,"" she says. ""Just try riding the ride.""Looking to get prescription medications delivered your door like Schreiber? Walgreens is offering free Same Day Prescription Delivery through September 25 at stores nationwide.Alana Schreiber pictured with her partner Dominic, who is holding their son Sawyer.

66,7b68b348-6842-3b7a-af76-efea931db479,WBA,2023-08-23,3 Beaten-Down Value Stocks You’ll Regret Not Buying During This Nasdaq Correction,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-beaten-down-value-stocks-221341910.html,1692224021.0,STORY,"['WBA', 'PYPL', 'QCOM', 'COMP', 'AAPL']","[After the stock market’s dismal performance in 2022, investors are savoring this year’s rally. The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 33% higher in the first half of the year, though the growth-oriented index seems to have stalled out since.While both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain in positive territory for July and August, the Nasdaq Composite is down over 1%.While that still places it well above the performance of its brethren for the year, the index remains almost 15% below the record high hit in November 2021. Sitting that far down means it is in a correction. It also means there are value stocks to buy on the dip.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe following three stocks are an unmatched opportunity to pick up good companies at an attractive price.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comStruggling pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is targeting $4.1 billion in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024, or double its 2022 effort. Even so, it remains very profitable on an adjusted basis. It also pays a dividend yielding 6.6% annually.Walgreens paid its first dividend back in the ’70s and started raising the payout three years later. It hasn’t stopped. That puts it on track to become a Dividend King — a stock that increases its dividend for 50 years or more.Walgreens is also expanding its focus beyond its pharmacies. In 2021, Walgreens invested $5.2 billion into VillageMD to become the majority owner of the primary care practice. The investment took Walgreens’ stake from 30% to 63%. It intends to have 1,000 locations open by 2027.VillageMD acquired Summit Health-CityMD last year, further expanding Walgreen’s reach into primary, specialty and urgent care. The move is a bid to gain a greater healthcare services market share.Walgreens Boots Alliance stock is down 23% this year but trades at a fraction of sales and just eight times earnings. There’s rarely ever been a time when Walgreens was such a cheap value stock.Story continuesPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comFintech giant PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is another beaten-down stock in the midst of a turnaround. Its shares are off 20% this year but 40% over the last 12 months. The decline means it’s trading at just 11 times next year’s earnings estimates.Part of PayPal’s problems is the increased competition in payments. The fintech is no longer the only alternative at checkout. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and others are now giving consumers options.Despite beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom line in the second quarter, PayPal reported its number of active accounts fell slightly from the previous quarter.PayPal, though, still looks poised to regain its momentum. It might not be immediate but within the next quarter or two.First, it just got a new chief executive officer (CEO). Alex Chriss came to the payments company from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). A fresh set of eyes could help rejuvenate the business and thwart Apple’s encroachment. Also, the better-than-forecast results show consumer spending is rising. Total payment volume jumped 10% last quarter. PayPal is often seen as a barometer of the direction the economy is heading. Confident consumers benefit from PayPal’s transaction-driven bottom line.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comSmartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is suffering from a crisis of confidence. The market is worried the smartphone market is saturated, and it will take some time to work off the overhang.The market analysts at Omdia said global smartphone shipments fell 10% in the second quarter. All major manufacturers dropped compared to a year ago and the previous quarter. That marks the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines.That’s a problem for Qualcomm. Apple and Samsung each account for more than 10% of Qualcomm’s revenue.The industry concentration didn’t help its performance. The chipmaker’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report showed the effects. Revenue was down 23% for the period while profits were cut in half. So, what makes it a buy now?The smartphone industry, while not exactly cyclical, goes through booms and busts. That said, the market isn’t collapsing. People will still want to upgrade their smartphones. Investors will just need a bit of patience.Qualcomm is also branching out into the automotive sector and artificial intelligence. They’re still small businesses right now but are growing fast for Qualcomm.President and CEO Cristiano Amon told investors, “on-device AI has the potential to drive an inflection point across all our products.” The automotive unit is also enjoying 11 straight quarters of year-over-year double-digit growth.Qualcomm stock is down 25% over the last 12 months and should be seen as a value stock you will regret not buying on the dip.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in WBA stock.

67,2a9e45f8-989b-3a42-b885-6a6d7edb7c62,PAYX,2023-08-23,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) sheds 3.5% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-nasdaq-payx-sheds-3-153616687.html,1692718576,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Paychex share price has climbed 66% in five years, easily topping the market return of 43% (ignoring dividends).Although Paychex has shed US$1.6b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Paychex achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.3% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Paychex's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Paychex, it has a TSR of 92% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.0% in the last year, Paychex shareholders lost 8.7% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 14% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Paychex is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

68,56ecddef-128b-3218-bd81-0a13f9c6885f,SBUX,2023-08-23,15 Countries That Tip the Most in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-tip-most-2023-213725138.html,1692740245,STORY,['SBUX'],"[In this article, we’ll discuss the 15 countries that tip the most in 2023. If you want to skip the details about recent tipping behavior and the rise of tipping culture, then head straight to the 5 Countries That Tip the Most in 2023. Tipping, involving giving extra money to workers, has seen an increasing integration with technology, a combination growing excessively due to economic factors. In fact, inflation is seen as a major challenge by 90% of restaurant operators. This trend has become particularly evident in 2023, where the choice of tipping or not has become a near-universal practice in the food service industry. Even at simple takeout places, customers may find themselves faced with a touch screen offering three distinct gratuity options, all while being observed by the cashier.Why do Americans tip so much?Despite common complaints, Americans are actually tipping more now. Square, which provides many of the iPads used for payments, reported a 16.5% rise in total tips at full-service restaurants in the last quarter of the previous year compared to the year before. At quick-service restaurants, the increase was 15.9%. Data from Toast, a restaurant software company, showed that diners were still tipping around 15% to 20%. For full-service eateries, average tips remained constant at 19.6% in the second and third quarters. However, quick-service restaurants experienced a slight drop in the average tip percentage, going from 16.9% to 16.8%, according to Toast. Requesting tips at self-checkoutsAlmost 20% of Americans now give tips for a wider range of services. About half of them admit to tipping when they wouldn't have before, all because an iPad suggested it, according to a PlayUSA survey of over 1,000 people in September. For example, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) introduced a new tipping approach recently, which got a big reaction from users. This Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) system requires customers to pick from set options for adding extra money, like $1 to $5. Many argue that Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) should focus on increasing employee wages instead of relying on customers for tips.Story continuesMeanwhile, in Chicago, larger restaurants currently compensate their staff with a minimum hourly rate of $9.48. This is in anticipation that tips will bridge the gap between this rate and the non-tipped business minimum wage of $15.80 per hour. In July, the City Council introduced a proposal mandating that all tipped workers receive the $15.80 wage. However, businesses are now grappling with the challenge of balancing higher wages for new hires while avoiding price increases. This dual pressure has prompted them to explore additional revenue sources to sustain their operations.Is the rising tipping culture hurting sales?Despite the potential benefit of added charges for employees and employers, there's a risk of straining the relationship between restaurants and customers. Ironically, this tipping dilemma emerges at a time when Americans are more generous than ever in their tipping practices. According to data from tech provider Toast, average tip sizes exceeded 20% during the initial pandemic months, driven by a desire to support essential workers. While the pandemic's impact has eased, the inclination to tip generously persists.Amidst all this, many Americans are grappling with the overwhelming costs of daily life. Rising prices for essentials like food, rent, and gas due to inflation are taking their toll. With about 58% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, the practice of tipping can further strain their finances. In a time where financial caution is the norm due to limited resources, the pressure of tipping is adding to their financial burdens. Tipping should be left to those who are financially secure. Now read on to explore questions like what countries tip the most and what percent should you tip in 2023.15 Countries That Tip the Most in 2023Our Methodology To create the list of countries that tip the most in 2023, we conducted a comprehensive search for tipping practices of restaurant staff, hotel staff, and taxi drivers across 30 different countries. We consulted the TripAdvisor tipping guides specific to each country to collect data. Subsequently, we calculated the average percentage of tipping rates for each country based on the gathered data. We then compiled a selection of the top 15 countries that exhibit the most generous tipping behaviors in 2023. These countries have been arranged in ascending order according to their tipping percentages. If you want to explore the most visited countries then check out World Tourism Rankings by Country: Top 20 Countries. 15 Countries That Tip the Most Here is the list of countries that tip the most in 2023. 15. United KingdomRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $2-$5Driver tip: No tipAverage tip rate: 4.17%In the United Kingdom, for exceptional service, a tip of approximately 10% added to the bill is suitable. In UK hotels, tipping isn't usually expected. Yet, in more upscale venues with porters or maids, a modest $2-5 tip is adequate. Tipping norms in the UK align more with other European countries, where it's less common.14. VietnamRestaurant tip: 5-10%Hotel tip: $1-$2Driver tip: Round upAverage tip rate: 4.50%Tipping was traditionally absent from Southeast Asian culture, but in Vietnam, it's gained traction due to Western tourists. Vietnamese tourists generally don't tip, as they consider it unnecessary. With a significant part of Vietnam's service sector comprising street food stalls and family-owned ventures, tipping practices aren't firmly established. If tipping at Vietnamese restaurants, around 5-10% is recommended. However, the precise amount varies based on location, occasion, and order size.13. GreeceRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $1Driver tip: No TipAverage tip rate: 5.50%Tipping is prevalent in Greece, particularly within the hospitality sector. A 10% tip added to the bill is seen as fitting in local restaurants. Though customary, tipping isn't obligatory, and not tipping won't be deemed rude or met with negative reactions.12. CroatiaRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $2-$2.5Driver tip: No tipAverage tip rate: 5.75%While not obligatory, tipping is ingrained in Croatian culture without being anticipated. Adding around 10% to the bill is suitable for local restaurants. In cafes and bars, rounding up the bill or around 3-5% is customary. Tipping in Croatian hotels isn't necessary. Yet, for porters or maids in upscale establishments, a modest 20 Kuna tip (about £2 or $3) is appropriate.11. TurkeyRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $1-$2Driver tip: Round upAverage tip rate: 5.75%Tipping in Turkey is customary and valued across sectors like restaurants, hotels, and taxis. In high-end restaurants, where a service charge might be included, an extra 10% tip for servers is greatly welcomed. While not obligatory, rounding up taxi fares is prevalent. In the hotel context, while not anticipated, tipping hotel staff, especially porters and concierges, for excellent service is a common practice.10. ItalyRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $1-$5Driver tip: No tipAverage tip rate: 6.50%Tipping in Italy isn't obligatory, and not every service requires it. Basic instances like coffee, taxis, or pizzeria dinners usually don't warrant tipping. While not expected, most workers won't decline tips. Italian restaurants may include a ""coperto,"" a cover charge for items like bread and oil, separate from tips. For great service or gratitude, a small tip is fitting, often rounding up the bill or leaving a few euros. A ballpark guideline for a standard restaurant is around 10% of the bill. Unlike countries where tips significantly supplement incomes, Italian waiters receive monthly salaries, reducing the reliance on tipping.9. QatarRestaurant tip: 10-15%Hotel tip: $2-$3Driver tip: No tipAverage tip rate: 7.00%In Qatar, tipping garners importance across service industries encompassing restaurants, hotels, and taxis. Tipping norms suggest 10-15% of the bill, serving as an appreciative gesture for commendable service. Tipping is customary for tourists in Qatar at eateries, lodgings, and for drivers. The exact amount hinges on service quality, often settling around 10-15% of the bill. Tipping taxi drivers isn't obligatory but rounding up fares to the nearest whole number is customary.8. United Arab EmiratesRestaurant tip: 10-15%Hotel tip: $1-$2Driver tip: Round upAverage tip rate: 7.00%Tipping practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) follow distinct norms across service sectors like restaurants, hotels, and taxis. While hotel restaurants might include a 10-15% service charge, tipping other hotel staff is less common. In restaurants, around 10-15% of the bill is customary. UAE's federal law automatically adds a 10% tip to service bills. For taxis, rounding up the fare is the norm. This consistent tipping culture has endured in the UAE over the years.7. FranceRestaurant tip: 10%Hotel tip: $1-$2Driver tip: 10%Average tip rate: 7.17%Tipping customs in France reflect discretion and appreciation. Though not obligatory, hotel staff like porters and concierges are often tipped for exceptional service, with the amount being discretionary. Similarly, while not compulsory, rounding up the fare is common when tipping taxi drivers. French tipping culture centers on showing gratitude for excellent service through discretionary tips.6. PolandRestaurant tip: 10%-15%Hotel tip: $2Driver tip: No tipAverage tip rate: 7.25%Tipping practices in Poland differentiate it from other countries like Germany. Porters and bellboys are not as common in Polish hotels. When present, a tip of 5-10 PLN is deemed appropriate.

69,b83c11a3-a0db-3f12-8329-13b3f01eded6,SBUX,2023-08-23,Why China's economy may not overtake the U.S.' just yet,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-chinas-economy-may-not-152433529.html,1692717873,VIDEO,"['SBUX', 'AAPL']","[For years, there has been talk about China's economy eventually becoming larger than the United States'. Council on Foreign Relations Fellow Zongyuan Zoe Liu is ""increasingly suspicious"" of that happening any time soon. ""I still see China's growth potential in the long run, but what really is constraining the Chinese growth potential comes from both economic fundamentals that is related to the financial repression growth model and the other aspects is geopolitics,"" Liu says.When it comes to international companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and Apple (AAPL) who invest in China, Liu says that middle-income families ""are not necessarily incentivized to spend"" right now. Liu cites declining income growth and weakening job prospects.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: When we look at what happens next for the Chinese economy, I mean, for years there had been predictions that it would overtake the economy of the US in size. Is that still going to happen?ZONGYUAN ZOE LIU: So that question, I wish I have a crystal ball here. But I would-- I'm increasingly suspicious in terms of to what extent that China can surpass the US economy because if we just look at a per capita number, obviously China has the too many people. Anything divided by 1.4 billion is going to be minimal. But I still see China's growth potential in the long run.But what really is constraining the Chinese growth potential comes from both economic fundamentals that is related to the financial repression growth model. And then the other aspect is geopolitics. And a lot of these really created deflationary pressure, both from domestic and from international. And the deflationary pressure right now, we say, oh, probably there is an argument to be made.The current deflationary pressure could potentially be transitory because in particular for the consumer price, it was because of a significant drop in pork price, therefore price overall at the aggregate level went down.But if you look at-- but if the politics is right, meaning if President Xi Jinping stop major policy swings, if he took the initiative to warm up relationship or ease the relationship with the west, perhaps uncertainties and the risk would be escalate, therefore Chinese household would not be thinking about what if there is a war.Story continuesAnd my individual economic security is going to be subjected to military conflict, whether it is Taiwan or something else. So they might be incentivized to spend or for that matter international companies would continue to invest in China. Other than that, I would still think the cloud over the Chinese economy from geopolitic's side is still going to be deflationary.BRAD SMITH: And so what is that? What is the state of international companies investing in China? Because if you listen to earnings calls from companies like Starbucks or like Apple, they'll continue to talk about how core of a region to their growth ambitions that greater China is. And, of course, that kind of looks across how they break out their regions. But more specifically, they speak about China. And so with that in mind, what is the state of the investment?Because they would say, yeah, this is key to our growth, but at the same time, there's something different at play from what you're spelling out here.ZONGYUAN ZOE LIU: I mean, again, this comes down to the size of the market. For a long period of time, 1.4 billion is a big market for any consumer-based company, whether it is Estée Lauder or Starbucks, it is a big market. And related to that, the taking a long position on China, there is also the aspect of, well, there is rising middle income-- rising middle class, right? And they are increasingly willing to spend.But the problem right now is the middle income families, they are not necessarily incentivized to spend. And part of the reason is because the income growth over the past 10 years have declined and at household level. And then on top of that, job prospect is also decline coming from both state employers, as well as multinationals. Unemployment number latest is about-- is about 21.4%, and now stop updating.If we compare China's youth unemployment number with OECD level, OECD is about 10%. And 21% is only narrowly characterizing urban dwelling youth, ages between 16 and 24. Now, you realize, well, as the aggregate level perhaps, youth unemployment is even higher.So from that perspective, I really think that China, yes, it is a big market. But perhaps in the mid-term, in the short run, at least now as long as President Xi Jinping's policy does not change, probably the market outlook is not necessarily good. But longer term, probably still positive.]"

But perhaps the bigger question for investors is what other companies are already benefiting and monetizing demand for artificial intelligence.The answer right now seems to be none — or at least none near the scale at which Nvidia is already profiting. But there are firms, both chipmakers and those in the larger AI ecosystem, that are starting to see revenue come in related to AI, with the promise (they say) of much more.One of the lesser-known names making an AI pitch is Synopsys (SNPS). Chipmakers use the company’s software to design and verify their products. Synopsys’s incoming CEO Sassine Ghazi told Yahoo Finance Live that AI currently accounts for about 10% of sales, and is only in its early stages.According to Ghazi, there are two factors shaping chip demand: the trend toward ""everything is smart"" (fridge, car, watch), and AI.""With AI, in order to make it happen and a reality, you need more sophisticated chips in the cloud or in the data center as well as more sophisticated chips on the edge. With those two factors, the demand for semiconductors is unprecedented,"" said Ghazi, who is set to succeed founder Aart de Geus as CEO on Jan. 1.Synopsys last week reported third quarter revenue rose by 19% to $1.49 billion, and forecast fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Earlier in the week, it announced a new contract with Intel to develop intellectual property for the company’s new factories, which will increasingly involve AI.“When you look at the engineers available to develop and design these chips, they are at an all-time shortage,” Ghazi said. “This is where Synopsys plays a huge role in the automation and modernization of the chip design. You can implement AI for chip design where you can reduce the tasks from many engineers to fewer engineers in a much shorter time.”Story continuesAll of that said, most of the current demand for chips is still being driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), smartphones, and other processes that don’t involve generative AI.Like Synopsys, Applied Materials (AMAT) sees most of the demand for AI in its future. The largest manufacturer of chipmaking equipment last week reported earnings, saying equipment for AI now accounts for 5% of its total sales, compared with 20% for data center and 10% to 15% for IoT. AMAT chief financial officer Brice Hill said peers have discussed a growth rate of 30% to 50% for AI demand. “So if you view 5% as a relatively small amount, we do think that it's growing rapidly and will be an important workload going forward,” he said on the call.morning brief imageOf course, some investors want AI to be monetized now and aren’t willing to wait. Matthew Bryson, who covers the semiconductor industry as senior vice president of hardware equity research at Wedbush, says Nvidia is the way to go.“I think it’s easiest to buy Nvidia and forget it,” he said. And he said it’s less important what Nvidia reports in terms of exact numbers and more important what it discusses around AI demand.“There is a ton of demand out there right now,” Bryson said. “It’s not being satisfied. It takes 40-plus weeks to get it from Nvidia. There’s just not enough supply.”Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 49% over a half decade. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 15% in a month. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.With the stock having lost 4.9% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Looking back five years, both Southwest Airlines' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 30% per year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 12% compound annual share price fall. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Southwest Airlines' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.0% in the last year, Southwest Airlines shareholders lost 15% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Southwest Airlines has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.Story continuesOf course Southwest Airlines may not be the best stock to buy.

President Joe Biden's nominee to head the agency Phil Washington withdrew in March and the White House has yet to pick a new nominee.Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg since June has been serving as acting FAA administrator in addition to her USDOT duties.The FAA said its preliminary review of the Aug. 11 incident showed an air traffic controller at San Diego International Airport cleared the Cessna to land even though Southwest Airlines Flight 2493 had already been told to taxi onto the same runway and await instructions to depart.A similar near-collision incident occurred in February in Austin, Texas, when a FedEx cargo plane and a Southwest Boeing 737 came within about 115 feet (35 meters) in poor visibility conditions. The controller had cleared the FedEx plane to land and the Southwest plane to depart.The FAA held a safety summit and issued a safety alert in March to airlines, pilots and others citing the ""need for continued vigilance and attention to mitigation of safety risks.""

PM is strategically positioned to benefit from its smoke-free product lineup and strong pricing power. The company's robust performance in the second quarter of 2023 demonstrated its resilience amid cost inflation and soft cigarette volumes.Impressive Q2 &amp; GuidancePhilip Morris posted robust second-quarter 2023 results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.60, which jumped 16.9% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48.Moreover, net revenues of $8,967 million increased by 10.5% on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line was pegged at $8,690 million. The year-over-year upside was backed by a rise in total cigarette and heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes, an improved product mix impact related to the greater proportion of smoke-free products and elevated combustible tobacco pricing.For 2023, Philip Morris expects net revenues to increase by nearly 7.5-8.5% on an organic basis. For the full-year 2023, management expects adjusted EPS in the band of $6.13-$6.22 compared with the $5.98 reported in 2022. Excluding currency movements, the adjusted EPS is envisioned in the band of $6.46-$6.55, suggesting 8-9.5% growth from the year-ago period figure.PM expects robust organic adjusted operating income growth in the second half of 2023, which is likely to fuel adjusted operating margin expansion. For the third quarter of 2023, Philip Morris expects adjusted EPS in the band of $1.60-$1.65. The EPS guidance reflects organic top-line growth in the high single digits, among other factors. Moving on, the company expects a meaningfully solid performance in the fourth quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Shift Toward Smoke-Free ProductsOne of the pivotal strengths of Philip Morris lies in its successful transition toward smoke-free alternatives, which contributed to 35.4% of the company's net revenues in the second quarter. PM is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading reduced-risk products (RRPs) in the industry.Backed by substantial scientific research, these advanced products are designed to facilitate adult smokers in transitioning away from traditional cigarettes. In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically).Further, in the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance, along with pricing power. Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).For 2023, management expects HTU shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. HTU shipment volumes are likely to be about 31-33 billion units in the third quarter.Story continuesCost &amp; Cigarette Volume ConcernsCigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the second quarter of 2023, Philip Morris’ cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.4% to 157 billion units.In 2023, the total international industry volume for cigarettes and HTUs is estimated to decline in the range of 0.5-1.5%, excluding China and the United States. For Philip Morris, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decrease 1.5-2.5% in 2023.The company has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income was somewhat affected by global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages. The adjusted operating margin of 39.4% contracted 1.4 percentage points year over year. PM expects to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA.Steadfast Pricing Offers ShieldPhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income in the face of declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the second quarter of 2023.Philip Morris remains well-positioned, leveraging its pricing strategies and smoke-free product portfolio strength to navigate the headwinds successfully.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230822408615/en/Western Union 2022 ESG Report (Photo: Business Wire)""What drives the most successful businesses is a strong sense of purpose,"" said Devin McGranahan, Chief Executive Officer. ""Western Union’s ESG progress is one important measure of how we are creating positive change in the lives of the people and communities we serve. We are continuing to build a company that lives up to our mission of supporting aspiring people everywhere.""2022 ESG HighlightsWestern Union’s ESG strategy is focused on efforts and areas where we can make meaningful impact, including:Supporting aspiring populations globally: Western Union’s network offers a broad mix of channels. Our retail and digital network reaches more than 200 countries and territories, serving millions of customers across more than 20,000 corridors or country pairings. This approach enables us to serve a broad range of customers, including those in rural and remote locations, people with difficulties using digital services, those who prefer to transact in cash and the estimated 1.4 billion1 adults worldwide who are unbanked by choice or circumstance. We believe offering people simple, trusted solutions via both digital and retail access points creates pathways for long-term economic success.Promoting the integrity of global money movement: Western Union progressed our commitment to helping build a global financial system our customers, partners and communities can trust. While third-party data show the rate of fraudulent activity across the financial industry is increasing, in 2022 our reported consumer fraud globally decreased by 12% and we prevented approximately $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions. These efforts were supported by fraud prevention education. Throughout 2022, we posted educational information and notifications regarding the war in Ukraine and charity-related fraud, as well as additional fraud types such as companionship, elder and World Cup advanced fee or online purchase scams. In fact, in 2022 we exceeded our consumer fraud-education goal of 300 million anti-fraud consumer touches, achieving 336 million touches.Fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture: Another key area of focus for the Company in 2022 was advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), as we aspire to have a workforce that reflects the customers we serve. In 2022, nearly 92 percent of our candidate slates and 84 percent of interview panels globally were diverse. We also continued to market job opportunities through partnerships and campaigns with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the U.S. and online platforms such as DiversityInc and the Minority Corporate Counsel Association. Western Union also piloted a sponsorship program aiming to identify high-performing women and connect them with mentors who can help maximize their potential and growth. Furthermore, we maintained gender pay equity globally and racial/ethnicity pay equity in the U.S. for the third consecutive year.The Western Union Foundation: In 2022, the Western Union Foundation, which creates economic opportunity for youth and people who migrate by empowering them with the education and resources needed to succeed in today’s global economy, concluded its three-year Opportunity Beyond Borders (OBB) commitment. OBB exceeded its goal with $20 Million invested, reaching two million people and connecting 50,000 people with new opportunities. The Foundation will announce details of its latest commitment later this year.Story continuesContinued RecognitionThe Company also continued to receive national and global recognitions for its ESG efforts in 2022, including:One of the World’s Most Ethical Companies® (second consecutive year)Bloomberg’s Gender Equality Index (fourth consecutive year)JUST Capital’s Top 100 Companies Supporting Healthy Families and Communities (second consecutive year)Human Rights Campaign’s Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality (third consecutive year)Bandera Azul Ecologica (recognizing work to protect and conserve Costa Rica’s natural resources)Great Place to Work Certified (Costa Rica, India)For more information and additional details related to our 2022 progress, and to download Western Union’s 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, click here.About Western UnionThe Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) is a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. If you want to see which blue chip stocks haven't done well this year, then you can check out 15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

GS is planning to sell part of its wealth management business. Per a Reuters article, the company is scaling back its ambitions to serve mass consumers and deciding to focus on serving the ultra-rich.GS stated that it was evaluating alternatives for its registered investment adviser (RIA) unit, named Personal Financial Management (PFM).Goldman had acquired the RIA unit which was formerly known as United Capital Financial Partners, Inc. in an all-cash deal valued at $750 million in May, 2019. At the time of acquisition, United Capital had $25 billion of assets under management and over 220 financial advisors. The transaction was aimed at broadening its clientele beyond the ultra-rich and expanding its geographic footprint.PFM is a very small component of the firm’s overall wealth management business. The unit has contributed little to the overall growth of GS’ business.Besides this restructuring move, in June 2023, Goldman sold its consumer lending platform, GreenSky. GS has been refocusing its business on its core strengths of investment banking and trading, while reducing its retail footprint. Thus, these major business restructuring initiatives are an apt fit with the strategic overhaul.Once the proposed plan is fulfilled, Goldman would be focusing on its ultra-high-net-worth clients and growth of its core wealth business. These are more stable sources of revenues compared with income from investment banking and trading.Goldman’s shares have lost 11.4% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research GS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

MAT is benefiting from product portfolio expansion strategies across its key brands, the Optimizing for Growth program and capitalizing on strong demand for Hot Wheels. However, ongoing inflation, increased expenses, high debt and dismal North America sales performance are primary concerns.With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), this company boasts a noteworthy long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5%. To gain a deeper understanding, let's explore the reasons why investors should consider retaining this stock.Growth DriversBenefiting from a robust assortment of products encompassing core brands, licensed brands and profitable product affiliations, Mattel maintains a favorable growth stance. Thanks to its popularity among both young boys and girls, flagship brands like Hot Wheels have consistently held top positions across various product sectors for an extended period. Furthermore, Mattel has expanded its reach into additional consumer product categories like clothing, fashion and accessories as part of its brand-building efforts.The return of Disney Princess and Frozen to Mattel’s portfolio has driven the company’s second-quarter results and is consistently building momentum along with Monster High. Also, the launch of a variety of toys and products related to the Barbie movie has created demand in the market, being sold out across major distribution channels from release to date.MAT continues to expand its franchise brands with inaugurations of creative products like Hot Wheels Racerverse, which is a new character-driven play system. Also, upcoming introduction of digital game Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharge in fall 2023 will further expand Mattel’s  portfolio.Strong performance of Hot Wheels continues to impress investors. In 2022, gross billings at this brand rose 8% (on a reported basis) and 13% (at cc) year over year. During second-quarter 2023, the brand’s gross billings climbed 10% (on a reported basis) and 9% (at cc) to $315.2 million, year over year.Mattel has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects. Moreover, its initiatives of product portfolio expansion along with other digital advancements add to growth trend.Through its current cost-saving program, Mattel remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings, thus, enhancing margins. In 2021, the company initiated a new multi-year program — Optimizing for Growth. The program contributed $106 million of incremental savings in cost of goods in 2022.In the second quarter of 2023, it generated $24 million in savings through the execution of Optimizing for Growth program. Mattel is on track for the program to deliver its savings goal of $300 million by 2023.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConcernsIn the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross margin remained flat year over year at 44.9%. The scenario was primarily driven by cost inflation and an unfavorable fixed expense absorption. Inventory management expenditures, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expenses, added to the woes. The challenging environment is likely to persist for some time.In the second quarter, North America’s gross billings declined 18% (as reported and at cc) year over year. The downside was primarily due to dismal performance of Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other (including Action Figures), Infant, Toddler and Preschool (including Fisher-Price), and Vehicles (including Hot Wheels). Net sales in the North America segment plunged 18% year-over-year on a reported basis and at cc.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

96,252a8d2e-d1cf-39b2-8836-2ca9b928da1b,SLB,2023-08-23,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-trending-stock-215533485.html,1692741333,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has gained 2.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 points to a change of +37.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +24.9% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $32.92 billion and $36.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.2% and +11.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PLTR). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Aptiv PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Palantir Technologies Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that APTV's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.APTV currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.36, while PLTR has a forward P/E of 64.80. We also note that APTV has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PLTR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.14.Another notable valuation metric for APTV is its P/B ratio of 2.90. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PLTR has a P/B of 10.27.These metrics, and several others, help APTV earn a Value grade of B, while PLTR has been given a Value grade of F.Story continuesAPTV is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

In addition to this, the region will reap the benefits of accelerated marketplace refunds, seamless disbursements for retail and delivery industries, and enhanced person-to-person and international money transfer experiences, attributable to the roll out of the Mastercard platform across the UAE.Mastercard Send remains the preferred choice for merchants and consumers owing to its numerous tailwinds. With an expansive reach of 108 countries, Mastercard Send stands out over time-consuming conventional bank transfers and therefore infuses a sigh of relief across those regions where it is being rolled out.Such platforms are built leveraging the multi-rail payment capabilities of Mastercard and aim to offer increased speed, choice and convenience in money transfers across the farthest corners of the world while simultaneously assuring the safety and control of transactions as well.Partnerships similar to the latest one bear testament to Mastercard’s digital transformation efforts across the UAE, which result in the launch of innovative payment solutions in the region. A booming digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and the higher usage of smartphones, might have prompted MA to extend its platform across the UAE.And Checkout.com and Careem seems to be the apt partners for strengthening the footprint of Mastercard in the UAE. Checkout.com is the first PSP that has bagged an acquiring license from the UAE Central Bank and remains committed to providing improved payment flows. Meanwhile, Careem boasts more than 50 million registered customers and imparts them the facility to engage in a variety of daily services and subsequently, make secure payments through one unified smartphone app.Story continuesIn fact, Mastercard’s longstanding ties with Checkout.com has enabled the benefits of the Mastercard Send platform to be reaped by different regions of the world time and again. In 2022, the partners collaborated to launch the platform across Italy. After extending the multiple benefits of the platform in Europe, MA took the help of the PSP to make the platform available across the Asia Pacific region this year.Shares of Mastercard have gained 15.3% in a year compared with the industry’s 5.6% growth.

101,a7f90019-eef2-3443-aa4b-c3049b53f4f2,AIG,2023-08-23,American International Group (NYSE:AIG) shareholders have earned a 28% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-nyse-aig-120034856.html,1692792034,STORY,['AIG'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) share price is up 94% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 8.2% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for American International Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, American International Group moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American International Group has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at American International Group's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of American International Group, it has a TSR of 110% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that American International Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 8.2% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American International Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for American International Group   you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -7.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 10.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of +3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 points to a change of -34.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $941.83 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. The $4.03 billion and $4.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.2% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $957.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,3b48415a-62e6-3eaf-952f-a208502d5161,NFLX,2023-08-23,UPDATE 1-Hollywood writers union says new proposal from studios not enough,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-hollywood-writers-union-says-084752868.html,1692780472,STORY,['NFLX'],"[(Adds WGA statement from paragraphs 7 onwards)Aug 23 (Reuters) - Hollywood studios and streaming services on Tuesday released the terms of a revised proposal to striking writers, but the union urged members to continue picketing as the new offer failed to address all their concerns.The Writers' Guild of America (WGA) had walked off the job on May 2 after negotiations reached an impasse, and were later joined by members of the Screen Actors Guild, halting productions across Hollywood and costing the California economy billions of dollars.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of companies including Walt Disney and Netflix, changed its offer to include new details about critical issues like compensation, minimum staffing, residual payments and curbs on artificial intelligence.According to the latest proposal, the WGA will get a compounded 13% pay increase over the three-year contract, and AI-generated written content will not be considered ""literary material"".The streaming platforms also offered to provide the WGA, which represents around 11,500 film and television writers, with the total number of hours viewed for each made-for-streaming show in confidential quarterly reports.""We have come to the table with an offer that meets the priority concerns the writers have expressed. We are deeply committed to ending the strike and are hopeful that the WGA will work toward the same resolution,"" AMPTP President Carol Lombardini said in a statement.WGA received the counterproposal from AMPTP on Aug. 11 and on Tuesday met with Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros CEO David Zaslav, NBCUniversal Studio Group Chair Donna Langley and Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, to discuss the new offer.""But this was not a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave,"" WGA said in a message to its members.The union said it explained in the meeting why the offer fell short and ""failed to sufficiently protect writers from the existential threats that caused us to strike in the first place"", but AMPTP released details of the proposal anyway.Story continuesWGA plans to continue picketing and said it would share with members more details on the state of the negotiations.""And we will see you all out on the picket lines and let the companies continue to see what labor power looks like,"" it said.(Reporting by Nilutpal Timsina in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates and Devika Syamnath)]"

Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal compares the year-over-year churn rates for streamers such as Apple TV (AAPL), Disney+ (DIS), Max, (WBD), Netflix, (NFLX), and Paramount (PARA), while commenting on the content crunch weighing on subscriber retention.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: There is a big issue facing the streaming giants as they compete for customers-- subscriber churn rates. We have some new data out today from Antenna. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the breakdown. So Allie, where are we at with this churn rate?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So churn is basically the rates of which subscribers are abandoning their streaming plans. And we're seeing that come as prices have ballooned across the board. We were just talking about last week how the golden age of streaming. It's no longer there anymore.But looking at this churn data, all the major subscriber platforms, also their churn levels increase. Now Antenna does define the monthly churn rate as cancels in a given month divided by subscribers at the end of the previous month. They also those rates increase except for one company. Who do you think it was?SEANA SMITH: Netflix.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Netflix. Now, the churn rate in the year-ago period for Netflix was 3.1%. This was 3%. So a slight deceleration there. And you could think that's probably due to the fact that we saw the password sharing crackdown. Netflix also is just very broad in their content, which I think is critical. But a lot of analysts that I've spoken with said that churn, subscriber churn in particular, is one of the biggest issues facing these media giants, especially as profitability continues to be a struggle here with losses mounting as well.SEANA SMITH: So Allie, how do you think that then shapes their strategy, right? Because they need to raise prices because they need to focus on profitability. But also they want to keep those churn rates low. They want to keep as many subscribers as possible.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: So there's a few things these platforms should be focusing on. One is original content and perhaps movies. So think libraries of content. That was one of the reasons why analysts were so bullish on Disney, because they have all that IP. They have all of those movies that kind of attract people to the platform. So if you focus on original content, that hopefully leads to engagement.Engagement is another thing that's important. You want people to be on your platform as long as they possibly can. How do you do that? By having a wide range of content, content that appeals to all different types of people, everyone in the family. That's something that Max is really trying to lean in on. It's something that Netflix has already been able to accomplish. And now they're adding more international content, which is increasing their exposure overseas, which is a great thing when you think about the writers strike, the SAG-AFTRA strike, everything going on in Hollywood right now.So those are the things that I think will influence strategy moving forward. And with that, I think is going to come some M&amp;A and some more media consolidation. So that you can kind of cut your losses and bolster where you can. So TBD.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It would be interesting to see who exactly partners with who--ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's going to happen. It's just a question of when. And you're right.DIANE KING HALL: We talked about this. Exactly. But no surprise about Netflix, though.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.DIANE KING HALL: You know. I mean, habits--ALEXANDRA CANAL: They're number one, man. It's crazy.DIANE KING HALL: All right. Alexandra Canal, thank you.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank you.]"

But the economic impact of the ""double whammy"" work stoppage, experts said, is only just beginning.""We met this week and continued to exchange proposals,"" the Writers Guild of America (WGA) wrote to members on Friday, adding, ""The Guild will communicate when we think there is something of significance to report.""SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — also remains firmly on the picket lines after joining striking writers in mid-July.The bottom line: ""We're inching towards compromise,"" Scott Purdy, KPMG’s US national media leader, told Yahoo Finance.The WGA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment, in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming. These demands are similar to those made by the actors' guild.Purdy predicted the strikes could likely last ""two to three times"" the prior 2007-2008 strike, which lasted for 100 days. That means a work stoppage that can run well into 2024.""The negotiating will happen when the pain on both sides gets to be too much,"" Purdy said. How so? When writers and other content producers can't hold out any longer without a source of income — and the studios run out of new content.He added: ""I really think there's too much pain to miss an entire other season. Right now it's a lose-lose situation.""Hollywood actors Susan Sarandon, Rosie Perez, Ezra Knight, and Julianna Margulies chant slogans as they participate in a picket line outside Warner Bros., Discovery, and Netflix offices in Manhattan, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Profitability, of course, remains top of mind for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Warner Bros., Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA) — hence the standstill in negotiations.Story continuesThe double strikes, meanwhile, will likely have serious economic implications, as the last writers' strike demonstrated.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., that work stoppage cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes could cost the national economy $4 billion-plus. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides just production — restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""A strike like this, especially as it's expanded to not just the writers but this time with the actors, is a total stoppage to almost everything that's scripted,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""And it's not just impacting these industries in California, but also [New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh] and all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.""Klowden shared Purdy's view that both sides will eventually have to cave, ""but it doesn't seem like either side is ready to"" right now.The strategist noted churn, or consumers cancelling their streaming plans due to a lack of content, will likely be a critical factor in determining a possible end date. Higher streaming prices have also caused further concerns.Still, Klowden warned nobody is safe, especially coming out of the pandemic.""Everybody's in a precarious position,"" he said. ""Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

That’s not too surprising, given the vigorous gains that the market enjoyed in the first half of 2023. That said, for investors in momentum stocks, there are still some appealing picks for August 2023.These three undervalued momentum stocks are still on the upswing. In fact, all of these picks made fresh 52-week highs last week. While the broader indexes may be starting to sag, these three momentum stocks to buy are well-positioned to keep rising in the current economic environment.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPhillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is a leading refining and midstream energy company. The company came into its current form in 2012 as a spinoff from oil major ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPhillips 66 operates in four businesses: midstream, chemicals, refining and marketing. That internal diversification helps make Phillips resilient to weakness in any one particular line of business.The firm has become much more profitable in recent years thanks to higher profit margins on refining operations. Given the unique dynamics in the international crude oil market, U.S. refiners are enjoying advantageous market conditions and are generating massive earnings.Traders are waking up to PSX stock; shares are up 27% over the past year. But even after the move, the stock trades for less than eight times forward earnings and offers a healthy 3.6% dividend yield. Famed billionaire Paul Tudor Jones also likes the value proposition of PSX stock, as it is one of his larger positions.Cboe Global Markets (CBOE)A 3D image of a hand touching an illustration of the earth.Cboe Global Markets (BATS:CBOE) is a stock exchange operator and financial products company. The firm is most known for offering its CBOE options exchange. In addition to broad market options, it has specific products, such as its volatility index (VIX).Cboe is an interesting business due to its counter-cyclicality. That is to say that CBOE stock can benefit when markets hit turbulence. That’s because traders often buy more put options and VIX products when the market is sliding. CBOE is a vendor of market insurance, in one sense, and can profit when markets hit trouble.Story continuesAs such, it probably shouldn’t be surprising that CBOE stock is rising to new highs now as the stock market entered a bit of a summer slump. Cboe is designed to thrive in nearly all sorts of macroeconomic climates. And, even after its share price increase, CBOE stock goes for just 21 times forward earnings. That’s a good price for a capital-light high profit-margin business such as this.UBS Group (UBS)UBS (UBS) bank sign on gray stone wall with red and gray logoSource: shutterstock.com/Judith LinineUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) is Switzerland’s leading bank. In addition to its core banking services in that market, it is also a leading wealth management firm that operates globally.UBS has a tremendous opportunity in 2023. That’s because the firm recently merged with Credit Suisse, greatly expanding UBS’ reach and giving it considerable economies of scale. Assuming merger synergies are achieved as anticipated, UBS will become far more profitable going forward.Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz sees excellent upside for UBS with a fair value target of $31.50 per share. That’d make for a solid gain from today’s $23.41 share price. UBS stock recently broke out to new highs, but given the size of the Credit Suisse deal, there is plenty more upside momentum ahead.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CBOE stock.

With the highly anticipated economic recession that never materialized, retail stocks have experienced some considerable revisions higher to their earnings estimates, boosting the near-term expectations of their stock prices.That isn’t to say the economic picture is perfect though. One interesting trend to emerge this year is the strength of discount retailers. With inflation continuing to put pressure on consumers’ budgets, many are preferring to shop where the prices are lower.Stocks like Ross Stores ROST and The TJX Companies TJX, who represent some of the top discount retailers, have seen strong upward trending earnings revisions, bullish prices action, and strong Q2 earnings that are beating analyst estimates.Sprouts Farmers Market SFM is another retailer that is building a powerful business, although it isn’t in the discount segment. All three of these stocks have top Zacks Ranks and are sitting at or near the all-time highs in their stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss StoresRoss Stores is a well-known off-price retail chain that operates under the brand names ""Ross Dress for Less"" and ""dd's DISCOUNTS."" ROST offers a wide range of discounted apparel, footwear, home goods, and accessories from various brands.With a focus on providing value-conscious consumers with quality products at affordable prices, Ross Stores has built a strong customer base. The company's unique business model of purchasing excess merchandise from manufacturers and department stores enables it to offer customers significant discounts. Ross Stores has a strong presence in the retail sector and continues to expand its footprint, making it a prominent player in the off-price retail industry.During its most recent quarterly earnings report Ross Stores beat earnings estimates by 13.5% and sales estimates by 4% confirming the flight to discount thesis. Following the trend, ROST has experienced some significant earnings estimate upgrades giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Top of FormStory continuesCurrent quarter earnings have been revised higher by 5.3% and are projected to grow 20% YoY to $1.20 per share. FY24 earnings have been increased by 5.7% and are expected to climb 18.5% YoY to $5.19 er share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss Stores stock has an extremely impressive long-term performance, nearly 4x that of the broad market over the last 20 years. During that period ROST has compounded at an annual rate of 16.7%. Interestingly, the stock has been trading sideways for almost five years now, however it looks like a big breakout could be just around the corner.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll that sideways trading has allowed ROST to bring down its earnings multiple and has become even more appealing in valuation terms over that time. Ross stores is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.8x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and below its five-year median of 23.6x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is another leading off-price retailer that operates popular brands such as T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and Sierra. With a vast network of stores, TJX offers a diverse selection of discounted apparel, home goods, and accessories from various brands.The company's unique business model involves sourcing merchandise from a wide range of suppliers, including manufacturers and department stores, allowing it to offer customers quality products at reduced prices. This approach has helped TJX build a loyal customer base that seeks value and treasure-hunt shopping experiences. As a result, TJX has established itself as a major player in the off-price retail segment and continues to expand its presence both domestically and internationally.Just last week The TJX Companies reported stellar Q2 earnings, beating analysts estimates on both the top and bottom line. In Q2 TJX witnessed a 6% increase in overall comp store sales, driven solely by customer traffic. Marmaxx's comp store sales surged by 8% in the same period, with strong performance in both its apparel and home segments. The pretax profit margin for Q2 improved by 1.2 percentage points compared to the previous year, reaching 10.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter reached $0.85, marking a 23% increase from the previous year.These results sent TJX stock to new all-time highs, where it currently sits. Additionally, the company returned $932 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As a result, the company has raised its outlook for FY24 in terms of overall comp store sales, pretax profit margin, and earnings per share.This exceptionally strong quarter has prompted analysts to increase their estimates nearly unanimously as well, giving TJX a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been boosted by 1% and are expected to climb 11.6% YoY, while FY24 estimates have been raised by 3.7% and are expected to grow 18.7% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.1x, which is below the industry average of 26.5x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSprouts Farmers MarketSprouts Farmers Market is a grocery store chain specializing in natural and organic products. With a focus on healthy and sustainable offerings, SFM provides fresh produce, natural meats, bulk foods, vitamins, and more. The company emphasizes a farm-to-table approach and aims to provide customers with affordable, high-quality options for healthier living.Sprouts Farmers Market sits at an interesting intersection of trends that should play in its favor for years to come. With a focus on healthy and sustainable offerings it plays off the broader trend towards mindfulness around healthy consumption. But it also makes sure to concentrate on value and inexpensive options, which can be hard to do when providing high quality products.Sprouts Framers Market’s expansion hasn’t gone unnoticed, and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Over the next 3-5 years earnings are expected to grow 9.3% annually, while sales are projected to grow 6% YoY during the next two years.SFM stock has been making very steady gains since putting in a low during the Covid-19 pandemic. And although the stock is up 60% over that time, outperforming the broad market, it still offers an extremely compelling valuation today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSprouts Farmers Market is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.3x, which is below the industry average of 16x, and below its 10-year median of 18.8x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionWhile retail has gone through some tremendous changes over the last decade thanks to the explosion in e-commerce, the industry has stabilized as more people realize there will always be a place for brick-and-mortar consumption. Additionally, with the incredible and persistent strength the US economy has demonstrated, it looks like there may be an extended period of retail success over the next few years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

111,c80cb91e-7c6d-3afa-af13-4f4474abc5e9,AMGN,2023-08-23,Health care stocks: What the market technicals show,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/health-care-stocks-market-technicals-172458395.html,1692725098,VIDEO,"['XLV', 'MRK', 'UNH', 'AMGN', 'JNJ']","[Why are UnitedHealth (UNH), Merck &amp; Company (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Amgen (AMGN), this strategist's top health care stock picks? Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss and break down the market technicals of health care stocks.Woods says he focuses on those four health care stocks, ""because they're in Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I give you health care.""The Health Care Select Sector (XLV) ""continues to make higher lows, as it goes along,"" Woods notes. ""If you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety sector,"" Woods says.Video Transcript- I know you have some picks in health care. Surprisingly, Pfizer not making your cut, though, Jay. So walk us through your base case. You've got UnitedHealth, Merck, J&amp;J, and Amgen, but not Pfizer.JAY WOODS: Well, I definitely don't have Pfizer. Pfizer has been a dog in the sector. And I focused on those four stocks. Why? Because they're in a Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I'll give you health care. The health care sector continues to make high or lows as it goes along.- There's health care.JAY WOODS: All right, so what do we see here? We see nice continued high or lows. Every time it sells off, it continues to get a little higher and it's consolidating in here.- Jay, I want to stop you for a second. Here's a 10-year chart, and I'm going to put some candlesticks back on. This is like-- I would call this a rare diamond formation. This is just consolidation in terms of a long-term secular trend, it looks like.JAY WOODS: Well, the diamond formation could be a negative. This is a debate in the technical analysis community, because sometimes this is a key reversal where you see come down. I, however, yes, I do see the diamond, but the way the underlying stocks, the stocks within the index, the UNHs of the world, which is the biggest component of the Dow because the Dow--Story continues- Look at UnitedHealth, very similar chart to XLV. This is 10 years, but I'm going to dial this down to a year to date and we can switch that as well.JAY WOODS: Yeah, UnitedHealthcare has been consolidating. It tested the 450 area here twice. And if you go back further in time, it's tested it several times. So we have a nice double bottom. It rallied above it. It's now above its 200 day moving average, and it can still run another 50 points and still be in this consolidation zone that we've seen. 50 points in UNH is another 300 Dow points. I think that's what we're going to see from it over the near term. And if you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety-- safety sector. So I think it's going to see some action.- Two more. We got Merck and Amgen. I don't know if we have time for both, but start with Merck.JAY WOODS: Let's focus on Merck because Merck is playing out seasonally just like it had last year. We had some consolidating periods where we've seen drop offs. And what has it done? It's rallied year in. The stock is flat year to date. Over the last 12 months, it's up about 25%. But year to date, it's flat.If people are looking for performance, if they're looking for something strong within the sector, it's not only in the Dow. It's a major impact on the XLV and the stock should rally into year end based on what we've seen before. And the fact that it's still making higher lows, I'm not very good at drawing with my finger, obviously, but it looks like in this consolidation period above 105, I still like Merck, and I think it's still bullish.- All right, Rochelle, any more?- Well, I was going to say, for people who are perhaps not familiar with some of the terms like diamond formation, what is the best way for them to sort of view some of the changes that they're seeing here?- Love it. Trader education.JAY WOODS: Trader education, risk management obviously number one-- rule number one, number two, number three when trading. When you get into the trade, you want to have levels. If this doesn't work out, like I just said in Merck, 105 something has changed to me. And I will take that loss, I will limit that loss.The formations are fun to follow, but I look for continuation patterns, and I'm seeing setups that can show continuation to the upside. So the risk reward set up to me in these stocks and in the sector is definitely bullish.- Jay, we got to go. Really appreciate you. Anybody who wants to learn about trading, also follow Jay Woods on Twitter, your handle.JAY WOODS: @ JayWoods3.- There you go. Rochelle.]"

Recent approvals include those from Korea's Fair Trade Commission, Papua New Guinea's Independent Consumer &amp; Competition Commission and Canada's Competition Bureau, all of which have given their clearance to the proposed acquisition.Additional regulatory clearances essential for Newmont's acquisition of Newcrest include those from the Australia Foreign Investment Review Board, the Japan Fair Trade Commission and the Philippine Competition Commission.

The culprit: Bloated balances on Macy's Citibank-powered credit card have been met with a rising interest rate environment.In turn, cash-strapped consumers — enduring an almost 32% annual percentage interest rate on the Macy's card — haven't been able to pay off their bills. Macy's has opted to write off those balances.""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with Wall Street. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Execs added that it's seeing the most acute pressure among households earning $75,000 and under.Year to date, Macy's credit card sales are down about 24% from a year ago.Macy's stock was slammed 14% on the warning, justifiably so.The credit card business has long been a pure profit center for a retailer like Macy's.Per data from Citi analyst Paul Lejuez, Macy's credit card business hauled in $863 million in sales last year — up about 12% from 2019. While that made up 3.5% of Macy's sales in 2022, it comprised an even larger percentage of operating profits.A significant percentage, to be precise.Lejuez's math pegs Macy's credit card business representing 49% of its operating profits in 2022, up from 35% in 2021. Pre-pandemic in 2019, the business made up 58% of Macy's operating profits.""2Q results highlight the challenges to Macy's traffic/sales, but inventory is in better shape and expenses have been well managed,"" Lejuez wrote. ""The more concerning issue this quarter is the more rapid-than-expected decline in credit income, which comprised ~50% of Macy's operating profits last year, and historically has been a cushion to EBIT as the retail business weakened.""Story continuesA woman holds a Macy's card in New Orleans. (Jenny Kane/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)With this profit center now under severe pressure due to consumers running out of money at month's end, it's no surprise investors have moved to rerate Macy's stock.And they have begun to do the same at Macy's rivals.Credit card sales made up 87% of operating profits at high-end department store Nordstrom (JWN) in 2022, according to Lejuez's data. In 2021, that number was 79%. Nordstrom's stock plunged 10% on Tuesday in sympathy to Macy's dreary commentary.Credit card sales generated the majority of operating profits at Kohl's (KSS) in 2022. Shares of Kohl's cratered 10.3% during the session.""Credit is also a significant contributor to EBIT at peers JWN/KSS,"" Lejuez added. ""We believe challenges in credit (higher delinquencies/bad debt) could lead retailers to pull back on who they extend credit to. Those that do could see a sales hit, and this may drive more consumers to trade down to off-pricers. Faster-than-expected deterioration in credit highlights the challenges facing the consumer (which we view as bad news for sales/margins across retail).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

With that, I'm going to hand it over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey GennetteGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to begin today's call with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion on the macro environment and how that is informing our approach to the remainder of the year. Tony will then give an update on our 5 growth vectors and the merchandising strategy. From there, Adrian will provide additional detail on the second quarter and our third quarter and full year outlooks. He will also discuss opportunities under his expanded role as COO.Before we dig into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastating wildfires on Maui. We have accounted for all our colleagues on the island, but a few have been directly impacted by the destruction and loss caused by the wildfires. We're supporting those colleagues via our North Star Relief Fund, and are engaged with the American Red Cross through our annual financial commitments and customer roundup campaigns across our Hawaii and Guam stores to support Maui residents. Turning to second quarter results. We achieved net sales of $5.13 billion, a gross margin rate of 38.1% and an SG&amp;A rate of 37.5%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.26 primarily benefited from better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&amp;A. These factors more than offset lower-than-anticipated credit card revenues and a timing shift in the recognition of shortage. Taking a step back, we exited the first quarter with excess spring seasonal receipts at Macy's due to lower-than-anticipated demand trends in the back half of the quarter. On our earnings call, we committed to entering fall in a clean inventory position. Ultimately, we ended the second quarter with inventories down 10% to last year and down 18% to 2019. We were disciplined with our approach to inventory commitments and flex the cadence and depth of promotions and markdowns, utilizing our data-driven tools to reduce the length of seasonal clearance activity by several weeks. Promotional sell-throughs were better than expected and clearance markdowns were not as deep. Thanks to our cross-functional teams for being nimble, flexible and embracing new ways of working. Entering the third quarter, store floors and online are less cluttered and easier to navigate. Content is fresh and seasonally appropriate with open-to-buy and the ability-to-chase into areas of strength, all of which improves the omnichannel shopping experience. At Macy's, net sales declined 9.3% and comparable sales declined 8.2% on an owned plus licensed basis. Aged inventories were roughly 20% below last year's levels and warm weather inventories were about 40% lower. Top-performing categories include beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, women's career sportswear and men's tailored clothing. We also continue to realize improvements in the soft home categories, including textiles and housewares. Active, casual and sleepwear remain challenged. We are working on solutions to improve trends in these categories. In the near term, Active should benefit from the reintroduction of Nike Men's, Women's and Kids online and in 75 doors in October, and the rollout to more than 200 doors this spring. This morning, we are also pleased to announce that Select Under Armour men's product will be available in 150 stores and online beginning in February. The return of Nike and Under Armour speaks to the strength and reach of Macy's and our ability to attract sought after wholesale partners. Looking ahead, we're working with both brands as well as potential new partners on how to expand further. Comparable owned sales for store within stores in our Macy's off-price concept, Backstage, outperformed Macy's full-line stores in which they operate by roughly 260 basis points. At Bloomingdale's, net sales declined 3.6% and comparable sales were down 2.6% on an owned plus license basis. Beauty, women's contemporary and designer apparel and shoes were our best-performing categories, while handbags, men's and dresses were challenged. Bloomingdale's focus remains on being the winning option for multi-branded upscale retail. During the quarter, we introduced HOKA, a leading active shoe brand that is highly relevant to our consumer, and it has been selling out. Bloomingdale's outlet outperformed full line Bloomingdale's locations by about 800 basis points. Later this month, we will be opening our 21st outlet, which will be located in Christiana, Delaware. At Bluemercury, net sales rose 5.6% and comparable sales increased 5.8%. Customers continue to respond well to our skin care and color cosmetic brands. While second quarter results largely exceeded our expectations, they were promotional and markdown driven, which makes it difficult to decipher any potential shifts in consumer health. As we plan the remainder of the year, and we think about 2024, we remain cautious on the pressures impacting our customer, especially at Macy's, where roughly 50% of the identified customers have an average household income of $75,000 or under. Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pulled back on spend in our discretionary categories. They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income, with an ongoing shift to services and experiences. We cannot predict when macro pressures will ease and are focused on controlling what we can control. However, we believe our strong balance sheet, continued disciplined approach to inventories and fortification of fundamentals position us well. Today, we are reading and reacting to shifting consumer preferences in real time. We have remixed category and brand level receipts, pulled back on what's not working and chased into areas of strength. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident in the thoughtful and strategic promotional calendar and offerings we have planned, and our ability to pivot to the right inventory at the right time and right value. We will continue to leverage our data science tools to refine inventory composition, breadth and depth on a weekly basis and a further streamlined decision-making to efficiently find and execute compelling opportunities that had a positive impact, both near and longer term. At Macy's, for back-to-school, we have a compelling mix of relevant national brands, including Jordan Kids, Levi's and Ralph Lauren, and are also offering a better selection of everyday basics, including uniforms. For holiday, we are further amplifying our strength as a gift-giving destination. We have elevated the quality of our products. We have built strong value across our categories from top market to private brands. And beauty and gifting are a more significant piece of our fourth quarter strategy, accounting for over 40% of Macy's brand sales versus mid-30s during the rest of the year. We anticipate a strong holiday for toys, and we will be offering a Disney 100th anniversary collaboration in store and online. This is the start of a longer-term strategic partnership with Disney and Toys ""R"" Us that will have elevated differentiated products across categories brought to life through engaging retail experiences. At Bloomingdale's, this holiday season, we are partnering with many of our luxury brands to introduce high-touch, unique experiences, events and pop-ups curated around the interests and shopping patterns of our best customers. These activations have been designed to create animation and inspiration in our stores and strengthen our client relationships. And at Bluemercury, we have an expanded fragrance offering for holiday, and we will launch our newest proprietary brand, which is focused on body and bath products. We are excited for the back half in all the ways we will serve our customer.Adrian will discuss our full year guidance in detail shortly, but it is important to note that despite elevated headwinds for credit card revenue and asset sales relative to prior outlook, we are reiterating our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Before turning it over to Tony, I want to congratulate our teams on several milestones. At Macy's, we recently introduced our newest private brand, On 34th. Its target demographic is the 30- to 50-year-old woman on the go. Commentary has been very positive, with approximately 80% of product reviews receiving 4 stars or above. At Bloomingdale's, we soft launched Marketplace in July. Customers have been discovering and responding well to the new categories and brands offer. And at Bluemercury, we moved our headquarters from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The team is energized by this important step in its growth trajectory, which places them in one of the major beauty centers of the world, brings cost efficiencies and allows them to further benefit from the existing infrastructure of Macy's, Inc. Looking ahead, we believe that our improving underlying fundamentals, 5 growth vectors and elevated customer experience are key components to relevancy and success as a modern department store. With that, Tony is going to discuss our 5 growth vectors and his approach to merchandising.Antony SpringThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing our teams for their dedication and the innovative work they are leading. I've always believed that valance of tenured and newer colleagues working together brings the most thoughtful and fresh perspectives, and I see that coming to life across the Macy's Inc. organization. Last week, we announced the arrival of Max Magni, our Chief Customer and Digital Officer. Max has over 20 years of experience at McKinsey, most recently as a senior partner, co-leading their next-gen commerce and consumer growth practices. We're excited to have Max join us and look forward to his contributions. Over the last several years, Jeff and Adrian have improved the operational efficiencies and financial health of the company. This has been a key enabler of our transformation and the advancement of our 5 growth vectors. These vectors are intertwined with the overarching strategy of keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our first growth vector is Macy's private brand reimagination. As Jeff mentioned, we recently launched On 34th, which has been informed by direct consumer research. Results are encouraging, with sales exceeding expectations, and we believe On 34th has the potential to become one of our biggest private brands. Our team has been thoughtful in both the development and planned rollout of our updated private brand strategy. Their imagination work has been built on 3 key pillars: first, branch stewardship; second, design with intention and execute with attention; and third, provide a meaningful value equation. From sourcing to marketing to merchandising, the teams have worked together to reflect our customers' wants and needs. They have considered life stages to create product and brands that authentically resonate with and capture the hearts of current and prospective customers. With the reinvigoration of our proprietary portfolio, we expect to further drive customer loyalty by complementing our national brand matrix with differentiated product, which should ultimately benefit sales and gross margin. Through 2025, we would be refreshing or replacing all existing brands in our portfolio and plan to introduce 4 new ones, including On 34th.As part of our updated private brand strategy, last year, we successfully refreshed Women's I.N.C. In the second quarter, momentum for this popular brand continued as sales once again outperformed its broader apparel segment. In September, we'll be introducing the next phase of I.N.C.'s Refresh. Our second growth vector is small store format. We are pleased with the performance of our 10 small-format locations, which include 8 Macy's and 2 Bloomie's. Macy's and Bloomie's stores that have been opened over a year had a positive comparable owned plus licensed sales growth. Last weekend, we opened our 9th small format Macy's just outside Chicagoland area and Indiana. And in September, we'll open 2 more; one will be in Las Vegas and the other will be in Boston, which is our first smaller format in the Northeast. In November, we will open a location in San Diego. Bloomingdale's is also adding to its small format portfolio, with plans to open a third location in November. The store will be located in Seattle, which is a new brick-and-mortar market for the brand. Our third growth vector is digital marketplace, which offers curated categories and brands that seamlessly integrate with the customer experience and have no inventory risk. At Macy's, we're approaching the 1-year anniversary of our marketplace launch. We now offer approximately 1,350 brands on the platform, up from 500 last fiscal year-end, and we grew gross merchandise value by over 116% from the first quarter. At Macy's marketplace, we continue to see significant cross-shopping, higher average order value and higher units per order. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we recently introduced Bloomingdale's marketplace and are pleased with the early results. Our fourth growth vector is luxury, which spans Bloomingdale's, Bluemercury and Macy's Beauty. At Bloomingdale's, we continue to optimize our relationship with our customers and elevate our luxury shopping experience. On a trailing 12-month basis, our top of the list loyalty customer base grew in both count and spend. We know this customer loves the Bloomingdale's shopping experience, and we have remodeled the Bloomingdale's doors with larger concentration of luxury brands and products. Improvements have focused on areas with higher luxury goods penetration, including beauty, fragrances, shoes, handbags and fine jewelry. Thus far, we have remodeled 5 locations and believe there is opportunity for more.At our smallest nameplate, Bluemercury, we realized the tenth consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Active customer count on a trailing 12-month basis rose 20%, driven primarily by new customers. Bluemercury's consistently strong performance is a testament to the work the team is doing to evolve the brand and product mix to stay ahead of trends and offer a more exclusive experience to the luxury skin care and beauty customer. At Macy's Beauty, we're expanding our luxury offering with a net business on newness, freshness in our core market brands and in-store service. As we prepare for the holiday, we will lean into our leading fragrance positioning across our omnichannel shopping experiences, and will introduce 6 additional beauty remodels, bringing the total to 39 locations. Our fifth growth vector is personalized offers and communications. It amplifies strategies across our business to increase customer lifetime value and loyalty by improving relevance of every interaction. Our digital and technology teams are in the early stages of implementing multistep and multichannel tests. We recently launched several new tools that will allow us to speak even more consistently to our customers across touch points, personalized conversations and increase the amount of behaviorally-driven marketing.I am confident that our 5 growth vectors should drive incremental sales growth beginning next year, and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Before turning the call over to Adrian, I want to provide a few thoughts on our overarching merchandise strategy. Over the last several months, I've been spending time with the Macy's team, discussing the right balance of private and market brands and the importance of duration. We're working together to combine their ideas and my experiences at Bloomingdale's. Currently, we are targeting 2 major opportunities. First, going after the right categories, brands and products that excite our customers. And second, maximizing sales and market share opportunity in underpenetrated categories where customers have signaled demand. In addition, we're exploring how we can further establish ourselves as a compelling wholesale partner for current and potential top market brands.The upcoming additions of Nike and Under Armour are 2 great examples. We are a business committed to transforming even in an environment that's unpredictable. Despite the macro conditions and challenges, we remain focused on satisfying our customers' desire to shop off-price to luxury digitally, on-mall or off-mall, and from private brands to up and coming and established national brands. Within that framework, our multichannel, multigenerational and multicategory platform is an advantage to address changing demand. I have confidence in our strategy and the team's ability to execute, which sets us up for success even in this uncertain environment. With that, let me turn it over to Adrian.Adrian V. MitchellThanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I want to start this morning by thanking my finance and real estate teams for their ongoing dedication and hard work, and to my colleagues in stores, technology and supply chain, I am grateful to partner with you more closely. In our last call, I shared the 3 fundamental areas of opportunity that we identified to build a faster, more flexible and more efficient operating model. First, improving the end-to-end omnichannel shopping experience; second, optimizing our physical store footprint while enhancing inventory flow, merchandise planning and localized assortment capabilities; and third, further modernizing our supply chain and technology infrastructure.Over the last few months, I have continued to align with our teams on how to simplify our processes, while providing more consistent shopping experiences that engage and inspire our customers. I look forward to sharing more on this effort in the future.Now let's talk through the second quarter performance for our 5 value creation levers. First, omnichannel sales. Net sales of $5.13 billion declined 8.4% versus the prior year, slightly above the high end of our outlook. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 7.3%. Owned AUR rose 4.7%, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued AUR improvement on ticket increases, lower markdowns and category mix. Other revenue of $150 million were 2.9% of net sales. Macy's Media Network revenue was flat to last year at $30 million. Our long-term confidence in Macy's Media Network is tempered by near-term caution in light of broader industry trends. During the quarter, credit card revenues declined 130 basis points or $84 million year-over-year to $120 million, and represented 2.3% of net sales. We experienced an increased rate of delinquencies within the credit card portfolio across all stages of aged balances. While we had expected delinquencies to rise as part of our normalizing credit environment, the speed at which the increase occurred for us and the broader credit card industry since our first quarter earnings call was faster than planned. This negatively impacted second quarter results and led to an increase in the portfolio's bad debt outlook.As a reminder, credit card revenues for the quarter include the pro rata recognition of the updated annual bad debt assumption. We will discuss our annual outlook inclusive of the updated bad debt assumptions within the credit card portfolio in just a few moments.The second value creation lever is gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 38.1%, 80 basis points below prior year, but above our outlook. Merchandise margin was 130 basis points lower than last year. During the quarter, we leveraged our data-driven processes and tools to maximize margins and sell-throughs of excess spring seasonal receipts. We surgically implemented clearance markdowns and promotions, which, while above last year's levels, were lower than forecasted in our prior outlook.Merchandise margin also impacted by unfavorable category mix shifts and a shift in the timing of shortage recognition, partially offset by better inbound freight charges from our cost savings efforts. In relation to shortage, we added a June physical inventory count in certain categories with low RFID penetration. This helped us better understand shortage trends and informed our outlook and approach to receipt planning for the remainder of the year. The count did not materially change our annual assumption, but it did provide actuals for the categories counted in the second quarter. As a result, we adjusted our shortage accrual shifting a portion of the recognition out of the fourth quarter and into the second and third quarters. Lastly, delivery expense decreased 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to improved carrier rates from contract renegotiations as well as lower fuel costs and lower vendor direct volume. Now let's turn to our third value creation lever, inventory productivity. End of quarter inventory was down 10% year-over-year and down 18% to 2019, which should represent a low point for the fiscal year. Trailing 12-month inventory turnover was roughly flat to last year. Inventory management is a key tenet to further improve the omnichannel customer experience. We're committed to having current and compelling product at the appropriate receipt levels based on expected sales demand.Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A expenses of $1.98 billion were better than our expectations, declining $31 million or 1.5% from prior year. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue was 37.5%, 300 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the decline in year-over-year sales. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.26 versus $1 in 2022. Better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&amp;A were offset by credit card revenues and shortage, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.11 and $0.04, respectively, relative to the midpoint of our prior outlook. Combined, this was roughly a $0.15 impact to EPS. Lastly, the fifth value creation lever, capital allocation. During the first half, we generated $271 million of operating cash flow versus $303 million last year. The change was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by lower merchandise inventories and merchandise accounts payable. We had $564 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow, inclusive of proceeds from real estate was an outflow of $261 million. And year-to-date, we paid $90 million in dividends. Regarding capital deployment in times of uncertainty, liquidity and a healthy balance sheet remain top priorities. They provide us the flexibility to respond to changing consumer and competitive trends, while continuing to invest in our core business and growth vectors. Now let's discuss the full year and third quarter outlook. To level set, we continue to have a cautious view on the consumer. In addition to the headwinds discussed on prior earnings calls, the expiration of student loan forgiveness beginning in October, higher interest rate levels and lower new job creation are all new pressures on the consumer. While we had contemplated these factors when providing an annual outlook on our last earnings call, it is still unknown how consumers will respond to them, especially after so many months of increased pressures. As such, we believe it is prudent to maintain our cautious view on the consumer and their capacity to spend on the discretionary categories we sell. Even with this backdrop, there is much that remains in our control. Entering the third quarter, inventories are clean, current and fresh, with an improved fashion and seasonless composition at compelling values that we believe appropriately reflects demand. Quarter-to-date sales results are in line with our expectations on reduced year-over-year promotions and clearance activity.Now that I've provided the framework on how we are thinking about the back half, let's walk through our updated full year expectations. Our full year outlook now contemplates reduced credit card revenues and asset sale gains, both of which are fully offset by better-than-expected second quarter results and favorable changes in interest expense and share count. Our outlook continues to include approximately $200 million of cost savings discussed on our last earnings call. For fiscal 2023, we now assume net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned plus licensed basis to be down about 7.5% to down 6% to last year. As a reminder, compares ease in the third and fourth quarters. Other revenue to be about 3.2% of net sales, with credit card revenues accounting for roughly 80% to 81% of that. The increased bad debt expectation for the credit card portfolio has resulted in a reduction in our annual forecast of roughly $80 million relative to our prior expectations. Given the magnitude of the credit card revenue impact, I want to take a moment to provide additional color. Credit card revenues are predominantly driven by the level and health of sales and receivables generated from our proprietary and co-brand credit cards. While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs. These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio. We are working closely with our bank partner, Citibank, to mitigate the rising bad debt by adjusting underwriting strategies. We also remain focused on acquiring new customers and retaining our active customer base as we communicate future personalized value to our customers. But we are not assuming any benefit in the near term.Additionally, potential regulatory changes regarding late fees are still pending. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. Returning to the remaining line items. We are anticipating a gross margin rate of 38.3% to 38.6%, which is slightly better than our prior expectations of 38% to 38.5%. Our assumption for shortage, which impacts gross margin, remains materially unchanged. Shortage continues to be a headwind, and we are focused on a variety of mitigation strategies, including testing the use of advanced technology, reporting and tools, moving high-step product away from entrances in our stores, optimizing asset protection staffing to target high-risk areas and collaborating with external parties to advocate for legislative change. Now let's turn to SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be 35.6% to 35.2%, or 36.7% to 36.4% as a percent of net sales, reflecting ongoing expense discipline efforts with additional risk on the low end given the importance of protecting the customer experience. Asset sale gains are now expected to be approximately $50 million, with nearly all the remaining gains anticipated in the fourth quarter. While the real estate market has become more challenging in light of higher interest rates, there is no change to our asset monetization strategies.We are confident in the value of our assets, have seen these cycles before, and we'll be patient to ensure we receive the appropriate valuations for our properties. Fortunately, we have the balance sheet to do so. We expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.7% to 9.4%, or 9% to 9.7% as a percent of net sales. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $160 million. After interest and taxes, we are maintaining our annual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 to $3.20, which reflects an updated annual diluted shares expectation of roughly 279 million shares.There are lots of moving parts to our annual EPS outlook. To summarize, relative to our prior expectation, gross margin, SG&amp;A and shares are the primary benefits. When looking at the low and high end of our current outlook compared to what we discussed on our first quarter call, gross margin, inclusive of volume and mix, is positively contributing an incremental $0.14 to the low end and $0.06 to the high end of our prior outlook. SG&amp;A is contributing an incremental $0.06 to $0.19. And together, lower share count and interest expense are contributing an incremental $0.04 These factors reflect solid execution in our core business and represents a $0.24 to $0.29 benefit relative to our prior outlook. On the flip side, reduced credit card revenues are a $0.21 to $0.22 drag on the low end and high end of our prior outlook, while lower asset sale gains are a $0.03 to $0.07 negative impact. Combined, this also represents $0.24 to $0.29, essentially canceling each other out. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance does not assume potential share repurchases. For the third quarter, we expect net sales of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion, gross margin rate to be at least 140 basis points better than the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder, last year, Macy's had elevated promotions and markdowns to clear excess receipts in warm weather seasonal goods and slower moving pandemic-related categories, including casual apparel and soft home. Adjusted diluted EPS down $0.03 to up $0.02, inclusive of our updated credit card revenues outlook and the timing shift in the recognition of shortage. End of quarter inventories to be down low to mid-single digits to last year on a percentage basis as we begin to introduce Nike and further support On 34th and I.N.C. private brands. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving low single-digit sales growth beginning next year and believe that improved underlying fundamentals and the early contributions of our 5 growth vectors will provide an offset to ongoing macro pressures impacting our consumer. However, we do have additional external factors that are more difficult to combat. If recent trends in credit card revenues, shortage and asset sale gains continue, and late fee regulatory changes are passed, the ability to achieve low double-digit EBITDA margin in '24 becomes more challenging. Now to be clear, there have been no changes to the underlying assumptions and opportunities regarding the rest of our business. We're actively working to offset headwinds, prioritize growth, and we'll share more as the year progresses. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.Jeffrey GennetteThank you, Adrian and Tony. It has been exciting to watch you two collaborate to find innovative ways of opportunity that reflects your unique lenses and backgrounds. And I am confident that you will lead Macy's, Inc. to sustainable long-term profitable growth. Now operator, we will now open it up for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver Chen2Q revenue and margins were encouragingly better. What was the driver behind that? And as we look at 3Q guidance being below Street, I assume it's primarily the credit card delinquency bad debt expense. AURs were also encouragingly up. What was the offset to that? We assume it could have been traffic. And a follow-up, as you think about longer term, the small format opportunity, how are you dimensionalizing the addressable market there?Adrian V. MitchellAll right. So, Oliver, good morning. It's great to be with you. So look, despite the timing shift that we recognized with shortage, we achieved the gross margin rate in the second quarter ahead of our expectation. So we were actually quite pleased with that. Now while the second quarter was more promotional than last year, as we worked to clear a lot of the seasonal product that we talked about, it was less promotional than we had anticipated. We leaned into a lot of our strategic and personalized promotions, leaned into our pricing science as we've talked about prior. But look, leveraging the data-driven processes that we've had in place and been using for the last couple of years, allowed us to really maximize our margins in sell-throughs as we actually exited the spring season. Now as we did in previous seasons, we're actually able to clear through a lot of the seasonal product that we've spoken about several weeks ahead of schedule. So we're continuing to take these behaviors into the back half of the year.Jeffrey GennetteThe other thing I'd add on that, Oliver, would be just our inventory is in a great position. So exiting the third quarter, down 10%, we have been able to retain a lot of liquidity that will respond to customer interest. But our stock-to-sales ratios are good by category. The third quarter has started at expectation. We're looking at the back-to-school read as well as really all new fall fashion and how that's performing. And we have confidence as we go into the fourth quarter on our strategies.Adrian V. MitchellIf I could just answer your last question, Oliver, with regards to small format stores, we're very excited about the growing impact of our small format stores. As you know, we remain in the early stages of continuing to scale this opportunity, but we did announce that we're opening up a number of stores this fall. Chicagoland, Boston, Las Vegas, San Diego are several locations where we'll be opening up our small format Macy's stores. And in the Seattle market, we'll be opening up a small format Bloomingdale's. Last week, we did open up a store in Chicagoland. But as we think about the quality of experience for our customers, we continue to see positive signals in terms of the financial performance and the customer experience within these stores. So we're actively evaluating potential locations across the country that will enable us to accelerate growth at the appropriate time. So more to come on this topic.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Tony, could you just elaborate on the key strategic initiatives that you believe best positions Macy's for a return to revenue growth next year? And then Adrian, any notable differences in top line by income cohort that you're seeing today, maybe relative to 3 months ago? Any change in macro that you're embedding for the back half of the year? And then just given the potential external changes that you mentioned, how best to think about a range of EBITDA margin outcomes for next year relative to the low double-digit target that you've laid out?Antony SpringThanks for the question, Matt. Let me begin with the opportunities for growth. Just as a reminder, I've been part of the Macy's executive leadership team for the last few years and working closely with Adrian and Jeff and other senior leaders the last few months. And I remain bullish on the opportunities for the entire portfolio. And remember, Macy's, Inc. is a portfolio company with obviously power in the Macy's brand, Bloomingdale's brand and Bluemercury brands. I believe that our opportunity remains in going off-price to luxury, multi-brand, multi-category. And these 5 growth vectors are designed to help us to amplify our business. They are designed around merchandise, which includes private brand and making sure that we are bringing the most important market brands to all of our portfolio. The reintroduction of Nike and the announcement of Under Armour is a good example of that. It's strengthening our marketing, but on a more personalized basis with specific offers that are right for that customer, at the level of modernization in our marketing. It's also making sure that our portfolio has the right number of stores in the right locations that include the quality malls that we're in today as well as, as Adrian described, the right small-format locations that densify, replace existing stores that may not be as productive, or allow us to enter new markets. The luxury business is a piece of the puzzle that we feel very strongly about. It underscores the importance of Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, but also gives us the opportunity to expand the Macy's Beauty business. And as we mentioned, beauty is a category that's grown across every single nameplate. So we feel strongly about all of our growth vectors. But in answering fully your question, I think the growth opportunity for the Macy's brand requires us to dig deeper into the assortments and making sure that we eliminate redundancy and we improve variety, making sure that people find the brands they're looking for as well as the level of exclusivity that comes from our private brand assortment. And the final piece I would say is the team is highly focused on improving the customer experience, physically and digitally, doing those things that are necessary to create a more seamless and easier omnichannel experience.Adrian V. MitchellMatt, just going through a few points that you raised. The first is we have a discerning customer across all income tiers. They're being quite choiceful about how they think about experiences versus discretionary goods. And so we continue to be thoughtful about focusing on the things that we can control to deliver a positive experience for our customers. The reality is, in the macro environment, we continue to remain cautious as we spoke about earlier in our opening remarks. We do believe that there continues to be pressure within the macro environment, so we will continue to remain cautious. To your third dimension around EBITDA margins, as we think about next year, the first thing that we would emphasize is what Tony spoke to, which is our top priority, is profitable growth. And that profitable growth is about low single-digit growth beginning next year, and we remain confident in that. The kinds of things that we're controlling is our balance sheet. The operating disciplines that you've seen from us around inventory management and expense management, the quality of execution on our fundamentals within our core business, and we continue to see that our 5 growth vectors remain on track. Now as it relates to low double-digit EBITDA, it remains our aspiration longer term. Now as we look on the horizon in the near term, we see several factors worsening and difficult to offset, again in the near term. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, credit card revenues, shortage and asset gains are all the type of things that are at the top of our list. So look, as we think about credit card revenues, we've experienced higher aged balances across all delinquency levels, which has lead to increased bad debt impact in our credit card. And as you know, there's still an open question about the legislative ruling on limiting late fees, which is something that we'll have to quantify the potential impacts of if that ruling comes to fruition. Shortage, as you know, has been an industry-wide opportunity. It has been at elevated levels for multiple years. Shortage for us for the second year in a row will be at record levels. Now, we continue to put mitigation strategies in place to address that, but these mitigation strategies will likely take time to effectuate. And then obviously, with regards to real estate, the industry is really challenged right now with higher interest rates, higher cap rates and higher hurdle rates. We do have confidence in our real estate, but we will be patient on our ability to monetize those assets. So when you look at the confluence of all these different factors, our ability to achieve low double-digit EBITDA in the near term may be more challenging. But as we progress through the year and we focus on our expense management initiatives and the growth initiatives that Tony referenced, we'll share more in the near future.OperatorThe next question is coming from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachAdrian, I was hoping you could help us understand the potential levers that you have for additional improvement in margin rate should the consumer dynamic backdrop worsen into the back half of the year? How are you thinking about merchandise margins and promotional backdrops? And what are the incremental opportunities in SG&amp;A expense beyond what you've already identified?Adrian V. MitchellAbsolutely. Thanks very much for raising the question, Brooke. As we think about gross margin, the disciplines that you've seen from us are pretty key. And that's really around strong execution on the customer experience and healthy inventory management. Now we've talked a lot about inventory management from the perspective of the volume of inventory which allows us to limit our markdowns, the composition of inventory that allows us to support full price sell-through as well as the freshness of inventory to have the relevant content for our customers to shop from us versus the competition. We'll continue to be very thoughtful about executing on those, but you've seen us pretty consistently execute on the gross margin side over time. The one thing I would call out as we think about gross margin for the balance of the year is we've done something a little bit different this year with shortage. So this year, we actually had a midyear shortage -- midyear inventory count, which gave us greater confidence and visibility into shortage trends for the year. So we did recognize some shortage in Q2. We will recognize some shortage in Q3 and Q4, which is different from what we've done in prior years, which is to recognize it all in the fourth quarter. So we are very thoughtful about how we're thinking about the margin rate going through the balance of the year. We're excited about the composition of inventory. We're excited about all the initiatives that Jeff and Tony spoke to, but we also are cautious in terms of making sure that we have the capacity to respond to growth opportunities and to absorb any potential promotions that we may need to do to move through the business in the fall season.As it relates to SG&amp;A, we continue to feel good about the $200 million that we spoke about in cost savings earlier in the year. We spoke about it in our June 1 call. We've been working on it for a number of months. We're seeing those come through, and a larger portion of those benefits, both on the SG&amp;A expense and the gross margin expense, is expected to materialize in the back course of the year, with the biggest being in the fourth quarter. But we continue to be very focused on expense discipline, and that's something that you'll continue to see us focus on for quite some time.OperatorThe next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck.Greg SommerI just wanted to dig into the health of the consumer a little more, looking at the outperformance of Bloomie's outlet and then also Backstage and then also higher credit card delinquencies, it would suggest that the health of the consumer has deteriorated and even at the high end. I was just curious, is this accurate? I just wanted to get more color on the health of the consumer by what you're seeing in terms of performance by store vendor or what you're seeing when you dig into the credit card data?Adrian V. MitchellSo why don't I start with the credit card data, and then we'll talk a little bit about the consumer a bit more broadly. So with regards to the credit card data, the one thing I would say is that we're managing our credit card revenues to the best extent we can. And I think the credit card revenue is an indication of some of the pressures that we're actually seeing on the consumer. So as you know, we have actually planned out higher delinquencies based on the expectation of a normalizing credit environment. But what we did see is that the speed of those delinquencies across all age balances or age balances actually accelerated after Q1, and that occurred primarily in June and July. So we've made a number of adjustments there. Now what's interesting about this is that there are things that we can control and things that we cannot control. The things that we're controlling is that we're working actively to mitigate a lot of the headwinds that we see. So for example, we're working with our credit card partner, Citibank, to target higher risk segments to surgically reduce exposure. We're also maintaining spend in places where we can for customers that have the capacity. We're acquiring new customers. We're retaining active customers, and we're focusing on the spend on their At Macy's on their prop card. But there are things that we cannot control, which I think gets very much into what you're describing around the health of the consumer, and that's the macro environment. So the macro environment really is having the lion's share of the impact on credit and is a real indicator of where we think the health of the consumer is and supporting our cautious approach. The one metric we find quite interesting is the debt service ratio, which we leverage as a proxy for the consumer's ability to pay debt using their disposable income -- personal income. So this is about credit card balances, this is about student loans which we know is going to come into focus in the next month or two, auto loans, mortgage. So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.Jeffrey GennetteChuck, what I'd add is your question about off-price. So just know that when we've always been quoting what's going on with our off-price business between Bloomingdale's and Macy's, you heard that off-price at Macy's outperformed the balance by almost 300 basis points at outlet Bloomingdale's versus the Bloomingdale's brand was about an 800-point difference. That really is just our -- when you think about being, in most cases, mall base to have an off-price option has been a potent part of our discovery with price. And so what we have seen over time is that there is no cannibalization that's going on between the full price and the off-price side. It's just building stickier relationships with customers. They're building up their spend with us. They're shopping more frequently. We certainly saw that in the second quarter. And then to your question about kind of how different income levels has been affected, we'll talk about the Macy's brand. Certainly, the Macy's brand is more under pressure, and it really is the stat of that 50% of the Macy's customers are making $75,000 or less. So they've been under pressure. I think there are some headwinds coming, particularly with student loan, that expiration of the loan forgiveness. And what we're really looking to do is controlling what we can control and ensuring that we've got the right stock to sales ratio in all of our categories, and that we've got receipt reserve to chase into demand. So we feel good about our fourth quarter strategy, and we feel good about where our inventories are right now with this consumer.OperatorThe next question is coming from Blake Anderson of Jefferies.Blake AndersonI was wondering if you could talk a little -- or give a little bit more color on the monthly trends you're seeing and maybe back-to-school and then just higher level. Talk about your confidence in the comp guide and kind of reiterating the comp guide for the rest of the year? I know you've talked about some pressures on the consumer, but you're being conservative. Just give a little bit more commentary on your decision to reiterate the previous comp guide for the year? And then second question was, on the promotional environment, wondering if you can talk about your expectations for the holiday in terms of promotions? And then how you're planning inventory for the holiday?Jeffrey GennetteOkay. Blake, so first off, let's just talk about the second quarter. So we're not disclosing our monthly performance. But as we talked about on the first quarter call, we did expect the second quarter to be promotional based on the spring seasonal inventory overhang. And we successfully liquidated any sort of liability that we had coming into the third quarter. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in looking at that trend since that is more clearance driven than what we are planning and experiencing right now in the third quarter. Third quarter started at our expectation, really a mix between our back-to-school performance as well as new fall fashion. And just to kind of reiterate, having those fundamentals in place of the stock-to-sales ratio, being in stock on all the most important items, having discipline with our pricing science and getting great traction on that, having inventory be as healthy as it is with a strong balance sheet and then really green shoots in our 4 growth factors is really kind of the stake that we're walking into the fall season with. So as we talk about the fourth quarter, we have confidence in our strategies. So the trending businesses like beauty and some of the gifting businesses, are a higher penetration of the fourth quarter business than it is the other 3 quarters. We should draft off of that. When you look at the amount of newness that we have in gifting, so high quality, great value, and that great value is built into our gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter. So we're going to be sharpen on our values. We're going to be competitive. As we've seen over the past couple of years, the customer is shopping earlier and they're shopping all the way through Black Friday, Cyber Monday, taking the lull last 10 days, we're ready for all that. We've built the promotional calendar so that we thought through all of where the customer where we expect them to shop in each of our brands. I think specifically, when you look at the fourth quarter, in addition to the gifting strategies and the penetration of trending businesses, it's also the add of Nike, it's the Toys ""R"" Us and the Disney collaboration. Very importantly, just the liquidity to be able to respond to inventory that's always in the system and this agile team that is responding in real time faster than ever. So that's what -- is what is built into our guide when we think about the back half of the year and the status of what we are -- where we're at going into it.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about the bad debt expense and credit cards, have you looked at it versus 2008, what could be similar and what's different in the trajectory? And then as you think about this current second quarter, how did -- what was the cadence of the quarter? How did you exit? I know, Jeff, you mentioned just about third quarter and back-to-school. Anything on tourism that we should note? And then Tony, just on other brands. It's nice to see Nike and Under Armour. Are there other categories that you want to enhance the brand assortments that we should be looking to?Adrian V. MitchellI'll start with regards to your question around credit card, and then I'll have Jeff and Tony speak to the quarter cadence. So look, we've looked at our credit card revenues and bad debt levels as far back is 2005 in our recent conversations. So we have a good understanding of the puts and takes. We recognize that there have been evolutions in terms of our agreement with Citibank. But from our perspective, it's continuing to control the controllables and continuing to navigate beyond controllables, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. Again, as I shared, so much of this is really around the health of the consumer, and so much is also around what we consider to be the debt service ratio. As you think about the average household income in the U.S., if you think about the average household income of our customers, particularly in the Macy's brand, that consumer is experiencing a number of headwinds as they think about servicing their responsibilities and their liabilities. I referenced it a little bit earlier credit cards. I referenced student loans, auto loans, mortgage, all those in a higher interest rate environment creates real challenges. Now coming into the year, we did project bad debt levels to normalize, but they just normalized a little bit faster than expected. But as we continue to look at ways to mitigate by giving more personalized offers to customers, as well as increased usage on our proprietary credit card, acquiring new customers and really leaning into the loyalty aspects, we're working very diligently to find the best offsets we can.Jeffrey GennetteDana, I'm going to -- I'll take on the cadence by month and the tourism, and I'll hand it over to Tony on new brands and new categories. On the -- as I mentioned in my conversation earlier, to the question from Blake, we're not disclosing our monthly performance and that it was heavily marked down and promotional driven. So that is on the second quarter. As it relates to tourism, this is one that we still have not seen the return of the depth of the international tourists that we typically have at Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So just to remind our international tourism is generally 3% to 4%. That's what it was in prepandemic sales. It's now south of 2% of our overall business. So that tailwind is coming in the future. We're not predicting yet when that's going to be, but know that when you look at the second quarter tourism business versus the first quarter, it was pretty similar. It was pretty comparable from where we are versus the 2019 level. I'll turn it over to Tony.Antony SpringThanks, Dana. I think the introduction of Nike is just a good example of what's possible as we go forward. It's an important brand, the #1 brand in the active category. And I think we obviously have built into our expectations the opportunity in Nike. The other benefit you have is people who come to Macy's for Nike don't just buy Nike, they're going to buy other things. So I'll tell you what I shared with the team last week as they took me through the spring merchandise assortments. First, I was excited to hear the level of newness and discovery and the interest in variety and the desire to bring more interest to our assortments. And I think that, that level of curiosity, that level of newness is an important ingredient in our success going forward. I think the other thing that's important is looking at these categories that are adjacent. So we have marketplace, which allows us to test quickly, introduce brands and ideas that we haven't had at Macy's or Bloomingdale's before. And then we can move quickly, whether we add those things to our stores or whether we keep them just as a part of the marketplace. But I think the team is very focused on bringing more newness and more interest and more excitement to our assortments.OperatorThe next question is coming from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulAnd Tony, great to talk with you. Best of luck with this undertaking. 2 questions for you. I guess the first one is, when you think about sort of the trend of digital versus the in-store, how are you thinking about that for the back half of the year? And then on the digital marketplace, is the sort of the ramp on the brands on the platform, especially at Macy's, is that where you want it to be? Or will you be adding more brands sort of into holiday and into next year?Antony SpringThanks, Bob. I think we are excited about the growth of the brand assortment on Macy's marketplace, and as we mentioned, the early read on Bloomingdale's marketplace. We have Max Magni who we mentioned, who joins us after a distinguished the 20-plus year career at McKinsey, focused on the digital business, and he will be very helpful, I think, to accelerating our performance in the digital space as well as in our overall marketplace business. I also want to just remind everyone that Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury are omnichannel businesses. And while we will always have these accelerations and movements based on cycles between the channels, our focus is making sure that we satisfy the customer no matter where they choose to shop. So that's a part of our small format expansion because customers are going off mall. It's a part of renovating in beauty at Macy's and on main floor Bloomingdale's, our most important mall doors because that's where people go to shop. It's a part of our investment into new experiences online because we want to make sure that we are both a place of transaction as well as a place of experience on Macy's bloomingdales.com and bluemercury.com. So we really do manage between the channels, but we ultimately are focused on satisfying the customer.Robert Scott DrbulGot it. And the other question I have is just on delivery expense, I think it was down this quarter. But I guess, how are you planning that for the remainder of the year?Adrian V. MitchellWell, delivery expense has been a part of some of the cost savings initiatives that we've thought about, which impacts the combination of the placement of our goods within our system, and also how we think about the processing of our delivery. So look, it continues to be an opportunity for us. We continue to benefit from some of the renegotiated terms with regards to our carrier expenses. We're continuing to look at opportunities to truly optimize how we think about owned versus media versus marketplace, which not only improves our expense profile, but also improves our margin profile. And so there's just a number of ongoing efforts that we have as it relates to inventory and as it relates to delivery expense.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCan you remind us what percent of your sales are done on credit? How that looks versus last year? And you also mentioned mitigating exposure to higher-risk customers. What percent of your credit card portfolio is made up of those customers? And do those mitigation efforts not have an immediate effect? You didn't reduce any second half sales guidance, I don't think at all. And I'm curious how long it might take those efforts to have an impact potentially on the top line that you would incorporate into your guidance?Adrian V. MitchellAbsolutely, Paul. Great to be with you. So on your first question, in recent history, we've typically been at around 2.9% to 3% of net sales. But if you look further back in history, it's actually been lower than that. So the question that was raised earlier about looking at our credit card revenues as a percent of net sales, we've looked at it as far back as 2005, and understanding the puts and takes that actually impact that performance. As it relates to the health of our credit card portfolio, we have a healthy portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we look at a number of factors beyond FICO scores to understand the health of the consumer, their capacity to spend, make thoughtful decisions about their line of credit, who we approve on the card versus not. So we do have a healthy portfolio. We look at our return on assets, and we'll continue to do that. I think the reality of what we've seen in the credit card shift is really around the pressure on the consumer. And again, that's the lion's share of the impact that does impact our credit card revenues. But look, we've seen these cycles before. We've been through these cycles before, and we will continue to work to find mitigation strategies within the context that we're given to increase credit card revenues to the appropriate levels, leveraging our personalized capabilities, continuing to expand our customer base across all nameplates. So it's just another dimension of our business that we have to manage actively as we go forward.Paul Lawrence LejuezAdrian, what percent of your sales are done on credit, the proprietary credit card?Adrian V. MitchellSo within our loyalty program, they're about 70%. I think about 72% of sales are done across our loyalty program, but our bronze tier is a nontender tier. So when you look at our gold, silver and platinum, our penetration rate today is about [43%].Paul Lawrence LejuezGot it. And what percent of the higher risk customers that you mentioned?Adrian V. MitchellLook, Paul, we have a healthy portfolio. We're not deep into subprime, if that's the nature of your question. We are not approving high-risk customers. We want to have healthy customers using our card for a longer period of time. And so we do not lean aggressively into subprime.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonJust 2 for me. The first is just on SG&amp;A. I wanted to dig in there a little bit more. It seems like the guidance contemplates higher SG&amp;A than prior, but I know you reiterated the $200 million in savings that you've identified. So can you just hash out further what's changed there, seemingly worsened versus 3 months ago? And then secondly, strength in select categories like beauty, are you all mixing further into those categories as a result? Or how nimble can you be as you see strength or weakness in certain categories?Adrian V. MitchellAll right. So thanks so much for the question, Alexandra. Let me start with SG&amp;A, and then I'll hand it over to Tony and Jeff. So look, our outlook includes a portion of the $200 million in annual cost savings that we identified and spoke to on the June 1 call. We spoke to the fact that 70% of that is SG&amp;A related to simplifying a lot of our processes and driving efficiencies across the business. The remaining 30% is really around things like delivery expense and inbound freight that was raised earlier in the conversation. Now as we demonstrated in the second quarter, SG&amp;A was better than our expectations due to these disciplines and these initiatives that I've referenced. And we continue to be very focused on expense management. We think there's lots of opportunities. And especially in this environment with so much volatility that we're responding to, we're very focused on expense management and discipline as best as we can. As we think about the back half of the year, we'll continue to be focused on expense management. But what's really important as well is making sure we have the appropriate level of investment in the customer experience. Our biggest quarter is ahead of us, which is the fourth quarter. That's where we tend to win as a gifting destination. And so we want to make sure that the customer has options, that we don't compromise the shopping experience and we take advantage of the biggest opportunity we can to have a solid year.Jeffrey GennetteAnd then, Alex, let me talk about the second part of your question. We -- based on the liquidity that we have always built in, and that's a new discipline that we've had over the past 1.5 years, we always have receipts that can chase into signals that are positive. And just as rigorous as what we do on a weekly basis is cutting back on signals that we expected that didn't materialize. So the opportunity to always be going where the customer is, this has not been an issue of not having brands or inventory available in the system to react to. So this is -- we've obviously, as we've discussed in the past, have changed our relationship with our key vendors, really buying more to net cost, not buying into markdown allowances, giving us full flexibility to respond to the customer in the moment. So we have confidence that to your question about beauty, we can chase into beauty. We have obviously built very aggressive strategies for the fall season based on our trends and our merchandising teams and the strength of those brands and where our customer expects us to be. So some we plan and some are going to react to and chase into.Antony SpringAnd Alex, let me add that we have strength and beauty across Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So that's digitally and physically on-mall and off-mall. And fragrance is an important category for us and trending well in all 3 nameplates. So we're bullish in the business for the fall.OperatorThe next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI wanted to focus for a minute on your cost savings program. You have spoken about a $300 million to $350 million run rate of savings in fiscal '24, but it seems that you're outperforming that early. How much of these things are included in the 2023 guidance versus how much will be incremental in 2024?Adrian V. MitchellThank you for your question. It's a good question, Lorraine. So as we referenced, the $200 million this year is a combination of both gross margin and SG&amp;A expense. What we spoke to on the last call was that there is an annualized benefit of about $300 million to $350 million. Now the reality is that we're continuing to benefit from those opportunities and those initiatives this year. So we're pretty excited about what we're seeing here. The key thing I would say is that the initiatives are real. And as an organization, we're continuing to lead into these expense opportunities. We have not given specifics on how this will materialize as we get into next year. We're still working through kind of how we think about our growth profile and margin profile for next year. But we'll definitely keep you posted and give you much greater clarity on those puts and takes as we get into 2024.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAnd then I just wanted to follow up on credit. It sounds like the second quarter numbers included pro rata recognition for the updated annual debt outlook. But it looks like you're guiding second half down to a similar decline. Can you talk about the dynamics of this revenue stream going forward?Adrian V. MitchellYes, absolutely. So the leading indicator on bad bet write-offs are the delinquency rates. So we look at it at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 30-day increments all the way up to 180 days, which is when the write-off actually happens. So from our perspective, as we think about past purchases, and we see the level of delinquencies that has been increasing across all age band balances, we're actually projecting what we believe to be the bad debt levels given the trends that we see. So given those leading indicators and what we see with other factors in and around the consumer that gives us a perspective and a greater level of confidence around what we believe our credit card revenues will be based on our bad debt levels.OperatorOur last question for today will be coming from Jay Sole of UBS.Jay Daniel SoleJust 2 questions for me. One, on the delinquency rate that you cited for June, July. Was the delinquency rate higher in July than what you saw in June? Was June the peak and then it slowed in July? And then secondly, just on the small stores, can you just elaborate a little bit on the proof points that you're seeing that give you confidence to open up more small stores? And how many small stores you see the company opening up over the next, say, 6 to 12 to 18 months?Adrian V. MitchellThanks so much for your question. So on delinquencies, the thing to keep in mind is that we did plan for higher delinquencies this year. We have spoken a number of times over the last 18 months about the credit environment really normalizing. But this was the first time in the second quarter where we actually saw that our projections were more conservative than the actuals. So what we've done with the acceleration, particularly that we saw in June and July that we've adjusted our trajectory per Lorraine's question that I spoke to a few moments ago. But effectively, what we've been doing is looking at that on a regular basis and making the appropriate adjustments for the trajectory of the return to a more normalized environment. As we think about small format stores, there are kind of 3 key things that we think about. The first is the quality of the customer experience. And as we look at a number of factors, including the availability of product, the quality of the experience, the quality of service, all these different factors what we're seeing are very healthy numbers as we think about the performance of these stores and the quality of the experience for the customer. The second thing that we look at is the financial trends of the business. And so for stores that are comped, we're seeing healthy year-over-year growth in this portfolio, and we're getting better. We see lots of opportunity around product, around how we engage customers in the local market. But even in spite of our learning experience, we continue to see growth in stores that are actually comping. The third thing that we're excited about is the potential that's ahead. And so when we think about where customers are, where we can invest, we see a portfolio of healthy big box stores where we will continue to invest, complemented by a large number of small format stores. We do believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate over the next several months in the timeframe that you described, but we'll be able to share more specifics on that, hopefully in the coming months and quarters.Antony SpringYes. And, Jay, I would add that we're excited in the Macy's small format that we now have Polo and Levi's and Finish Line in Sunglass Hut and now Nike added to those stores. And as Adrian mentioned, looking very carefully at the traffic, conversion and a whole host of other metrics to make sure that we are seeing the proof points necessary to expand the portfolio of small doors.OperatorAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gennette for closing comments.Jeffrey GennetteSo thanks, operator, and for all of you who's still on the call, I hope that you enjoy the last days of summer, and we look forward to updating you on our results on the third quarter on our November call. Thanks, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in Macy's. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

Brick-and-mortar sales fell 8% and digital sales decreased 10%, compared to a year ago.Credit card delinquencies roseMacy’s posted other revenue of $150 million, an $84 million decrease from a year ago. The decline was driven by credit card revenues that were negatively impacted by an increased rate of delinquencies, the company said.While delinquencies were expected to rise as part of a normalizing of the credit environment, the speed at which this occurred for the company and the broader credit card industry since the company’s first-quarter earnings call was faster than expected, Macy’s said. This negatively impacted results and led to an increase in the portfolio’s bad debt outlook, it added.“In the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results,” said chair and CEO Jeff Gennette. “Our teams surgically implemented clearance markdowns and promotions to effectively clear spring seasonal receipts and ensure fresh assortments for the fall and holiday seasons.”The company said that sales in beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, were strong as were women’s career sportswear, men’s tailored and off-price with Backstage, the company said. Active casual and sleepwear remained unchanged, it added.Gennette said the company continues “to see uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.”Because of that and the results year-to-date, Macy’s reaffirmed its “cautious” full-year outlook of adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 to $3.20 on net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion.Dick’s Sporting Goods Cuts Profit Outlook As Inventory Theft WorsensLowe’s Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates As Sales Decline SlightlyWalmart Shoppers Turn Out To Drive Up Quarterly Results]"

After all, it’s easy to understand why these transactions receive so much attention, as it’s a confidence booster for investors when an insider swoops in for a buy.But who is considered an insider?An insider is defined by Section 16 of the Security Exchange Act as an officer, director, 10% stockholder, or anyone who possesses information because of their relationship with the company. Of course, many strict rules apply.As of late, three stocks – Lennar LEN, Super Micro Computer SMCI, and NextEra Energy NEE – have all seen insider activity.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

To skip our detailed analysis of changing stock market dynamics today, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 5 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.""Routine August Pullback Or The Start Of A Meaningful Move Lower?""In the months leading up to August 2023, the stock market was seeing a prolonged rally. The valuations of many stocks got stretched during the first half of the year and were brought down as soon as August hit. According to a CNBC report from August 18, Cameron Dawson, the Chief Investment Officer at NewEdge Wealth, had the following to say on this matter:""I do think that corrections are very normal in even the best of bear markets, and we usually see them in the high single digits to low teens, that's all run of the mill, and what we were seeing into July is that you had a lot of position chasing, you had the dynamic of it all being valuation-driven, there was really no change in the earnings outlook, even after a great earnings season. And so it did appear that there was this 'feeding on itself' mentality that was leading to the upside, so no wonder you're seeing the air come out of stocks that went up the most.""Based on how market trends have been developing since the start of August, Adam Parker from Trivariate Research chimed in with the following take on the market:""I'm probably more bullish now than I was a month ago. I mean the market's down five and the earnings are higher - 2024 and 2023 earnings are up a little bit. So if I'm trying to be, you know, intellectually honest, I guess I should like it a little bit more than I did a month ago. I mean, earnings season I thought was pretty good, the big-cap tech stocks generally delivered.""Despite Parker's generally bullish outlook on the market, it was noted that the markets are seeing some pullback in several areas. One reason put forward for this development in August was seasonality. CNBC showed a seasonal history chart of the S&amp;P 500's performance dating from 1983 to 2023 to drive home the point that the benchmark index generally tends to experience a pullback around August. According to Dawson, though, seasonality is just one of several factors investment professionals need to take into account when mapping out the progress of the market to try and figure out why a pullback happens.Story continues""People Are Just Putting Money Elsewhere""Another August 18 CNBC report showed how the August pullback was not just restricted to stocks, with bonds and crypto also becoming part of the larger downhill trend witnessed in the markets. Here's what Victoria Fernandez, the Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, had to say about this:""I think you have to look at people's cash positions right now and look at their short term treasury allocations. I think that's where we're seeing a lot of this cash go. They're getting good yields by just keeping their money in cash, so why take the risk of having it in some tech names that are down 10-11% a month, having it in bonds where 10-year yields have gone up about 50 basis points over the last couple of weeks? So short term elements right now I think is where most people are hiding their money, waiting for an opportunity to get back in this market.""Sarah Kunst, the Managing Director at Cleo Capital, agreed with Fernandez's take on investment moves people are taking at this point, considering the way sectors like technology are currently performing in the market. Despite the August stock selloff, though, many sectors are continuing to hold on. A Reuters article from August 19 mentioned that defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities are continuing to rise even in August. The S&amp;P 500 energy index has also posted small gains, and the tech sector is brushing off the fall because of some rallying stocks.In each sector, the market-leading demeanor of companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) may help many sectors retain a significant portion of their gains even after the August selloff. In light of these developments, we have compiled a list of some of the top stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next three months.

The company's organic revenue results reflect broad strength across businesses and geographies, driven by execution, innovation, and improved underlying fundamentals. During the quarter, the company received CE Mark approval for the company's next-generation Inceptiv spinal cord stimulator with closed-loop sensing. Within Neiuroscience, Specialty Therapies results were driven by high-teens growth in ENT aided by supply improvement, low-single digit growth in Neurovascular, and low-single digit declines in Pelvic Health. Raised fiscal 2024 guidance looks encouraging.

128,acb6bc9a-3cf9-3166-89ef-f0b937d59a48,PDCO,2023-08-23,Masimo's (MASI) PVi Favored by Study for GDFT in Elderly Patients,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimos-masi-pvi-favored-study-170500160.html,1692723900,STORY,"['MASI', 'MCK', 'PDCO', 'HQY']","[Masimo Corporation MASI recently announced the findings of a prospective, randomized study in which researchers assessed the use of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index (PVi), as part of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), to guide intraoperative fluid administration during gastrointestinal (GI) surgery on elderly patients by comparing it to conventional fluid therapy. The findings were published in Perioperative Medicine.The latest positive study outcome is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s real-time patient monitoring business and is likely to solidify its position in the niche space on a global scale.Significance of the StudyThe researchers noted the value of optimizing fluid management during GI procedures, especially in elderly patients, because of the high rate of postoperative complications and frequent fluid deficits. Hence, they sought to determine whether GDFT using Masimo PVi might improve outcomes in this scenario.Currently, PVi is indicated as a non-invasive, dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness in select populations of mechanically-ventilated adult patients. Per the researchers, PVi has been shown to perform similarly to invasive methods of fluid assessment, such as pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation, in various surgeries.The researchers concluded that intraoperative GDFT based on simple and non-invasive PVi did not reduce the occurrence of composite postoperative complications among elderly patients undergoing GI surgery. However, it was associated with a lower cardiopulmonary complication rate, unlike usual fluid management.Per management, PVi’s utility as a fluid responsiveness indicator has been demonstrated in more than 100 independent, published studies. Management believes that the latest study will likely add to the outcomes evidence that PVi can be used to aid clinicians in managing the fluid levels of their patients without invasive catheters.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global fluid management devices market was valued at $4,563.0 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $13,292.76 million by 2031 at a CAGR of 11.3%. Factors like the rise in the number of minimally invasive surgeries, an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases and technological advancements are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the positive study outcome is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Masimo reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an expansion of its installed base. Management confirmed that the company gained new hospital customers during the quarter at a record level. The expansion of both margins in the quarter was also recorded.The same month, Masimo announced the findings of a study in which researchers evaluated the ability of Masimo SedLine brain function monitoring to assess the sedation levels of patients undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine (a sedative with numerous advantages). The findings were published in Frontiers in Neuroscience.In June, Masimo announced that Valencia, Spain-based Hospital La Fe will be expanding its telehealth and telemonitoring program with the Masimo W1 advanced health-tracking watch.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 26.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s 2.3% decline.

The successful integration of the recently-acquired business will strengthen, complement and expand STERIS’s product offerings within the Healthcare segment. However, a challenging macroeconomic environment and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 9.5% compared with the industry’s 2.3% plunge and the S&amp;P 500’s 7% rise.The renowned provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services has a market capitalization of $22.01 billion. The company’s projected earnings growth rate of 11% for the next year compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.8%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ1 Upsides: STERIS exited first-quarter fiscal 2024 with earnings and revenue beat. Barring Life Sciences and Dental, each of STERIS’s operating segments reported organic revenue growth, which is encouraging. Yet, escalating costs are exerting pressure on gross profit.In fiscal 2024, the company is optimistic about many of the challenges of fiscal 2023 abating, including procedure volumes and supply chain constraints. The company is also optimistic about the recently completed acquisition of BD’s surgical instrumentation, laparoscopic instrumentation and sterilization container assets. According to STE, the successful integration of the acquired business will strengthen, complement and expand STERIS’s product offerings within the Healthcare segment.Acquisition to Drive Growth: STERIS acquired surgical instrumentation assets from Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX). The transaction includes V. Mueller, Snowden-Pencer and Genesis branded products, which are the well-known providers of surgical instruments and sterilization containers to healthcare customers.The acquisition is a natural extension for STERIS in the operating room and sterile processing department. The addition of the brands is expected to strengthen, complement and expand STERIS’ product offerings within the Healthcare segment. Story continuesRaised Guidance: Considering the just-completed acquisition of the surgical instrumentation, laparoscopic instrumentation and sterilization container assets from Becton, Dickinson and Company or BD (BDX), STERIS updated its fiscal 2024 guidance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTERIS now expects fiscal 2024 revenues to increase 9-10% from fiscal 2023 (earlier expectation was in the range of 7-8% growth). Organic revenue expectation at CER remains unchanged at 6-7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.33 billion, implying 7.5% growth from fiscal 2023.Adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 are now expected to be in the range of $8.60 to $8.80 (the earlier range was $8.55 to $8.75). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $8.79.DownsidesTough Competition: STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large and small companies. The company expects to face continued competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control and gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market.Pricing Pressure: STERIS purchases raw materials and energy supplies from various suppliers, the availability and price of which are subject to volatility. Changes in regulatory requirements, unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt STERIS’ AST operations, in addition to other consequences.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for STERIS’ fiscal 2024 earnings has moved 3.4% north to $8.72The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.43 billion, suggesting a 9.6% growth from the fiscal 2023 reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Elevance Health, Inc.

Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 1.8% to $2.61 billion.Adjusted operating margin expanded 163 bps year over year to 23.3%.GuidanceMedtronic raised fiscal 2024 guidance.Fiscal 2024 organic revenue growth is expected to be 4.5% (up from the earlier guided range of 4-4.5%). The organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue related to certain businesses reported as Other. If foreign currency exchange rates as of the beginning of August hold, fiscal 2024 revenue growth on a reported basis would be approximately 2.75%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 worldwide revenues is pegged at $32.16 billion.The full-year adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.08 and $5.16 (the previous guidance was $5.00- $5.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.05.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal first quarter. The company's organic revenue results reflect broad strength across businesses and geographies, driven by execution, innovation, and improved underlying fundamentals. During the quarter, the company received CE Mark approval for its next-generation Inceptiv spinal cord stimulator with closed-loop sensing. Within Neiuroscience, Specialty Therapies, results are driven by high-teens growth in ENT aided by supply improvement, low-single digit growth in Neurovascular, and low-single digit declines in Pelvic Health. Raised fiscal 2024 guidance looks encouraging. However, macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc.

In addition to this, the region will reap the benefits of accelerated marketplace refunds, seamless disbursements for retail and delivery industries, and enhanced person-to-person and international money transfer experiences, attributable to the roll out of the Mastercard platform across the UAE.Mastercard Send remains the preferred choice for merchants and consumers owing to its numerous tailwinds. With an expansive reach of 108 countries, Mastercard Send stands out over time-consuming conventional bank transfers and therefore infuses a sigh of relief across those regions where it is being rolled out.Such platforms are built leveraging the multi-rail payment capabilities of Mastercard and aim to offer increased speed, choice and convenience in money transfers across the farthest corners of the world while simultaneously assuring the safety and control of transactions as well.Partnerships similar to the latest one bear testament to Mastercard’s digital transformation efforts across the UAE, which result in the launch of innovative payment solutions in the region. A booming digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and the higher usage of smartphones, might have prompted MA to extend its platform across the UAE.And Checkout.com and Careem seems to be the apt partners for strengthening the footprint of Mastercard in the UAE. Checkout.com is the first PSP that has bagged an acquiring license from the UAE Central Bank and remains committed to providing improved payment flows. Meanwhile, Careem boasts more than 50 million registered customers and imparts them the facility to engage in a variety of daily services and subsequently, make secure payments through one unified smartphone app.Story continuesIn fact, Mastercard’s longstanding ties with Checkout.com has enabled the benefits of the Mastercard Send platform to be reaped by different regions of the world time and again. In 2022, the partners collaborated to launch the platform across Italy. After extending the multiple benefits of the platform in Europe, MA took the help of the PSP to make the platform available across the Asia Pacific region this year.Shares of Mastercard have gained 15.3% in a year compared with the industry’s 5.6% growth.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Dan Howley explains how the company is going public after Nvidia (NVDA) unsuccessfully tried to take over the company in a move that was blocked by global regulators. Arm is a chip designer, who profits from licensing chips to other companies such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung (SMSN.IL), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Howley notes how the timing is unusual, given the state of the smartphone market, saying ""this IPO is coming at almost a strange time as we're seeing a slowdown in smartphone sales across the world.""For more Yahoo Finance coverage on this topic:Arm expected to unveil new data on IPO filingVideo TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, big news, SoftBank's Arm has filed for an IPO that happened late yesterday, snubbing the London Stock Exchange for the NASDAQ. Information does continue to trickle in about the chip designing company and its upcoming listing. It will be the biggest IPO in the US since Rivian in November 2021.DAN HOWLEY: Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley to discuss more. And this is a really interesting company, Dan, that has been around for a long time, has switched hands. Nvidia didn't succeed in buying it a couple of years ago. So now it is going to be making its public market debut.DAN HOWLEY: That's right. Yeah, Nvidia tried that $40 billion takeover, got shut down by global regulators. And so yeah, this is where we are. We're seeing Arm file for the IPO on the NASDAQ. The revenue for the last year was about 2.68 billion for the company.And just as you said, it's an interesting company. This isn't like TSMC or Intel. They don't build chips themselves. What they do is they design chips and then license those to other companies. We're talking about Apple Samsung Qualcomm, any kind of company that offers a mobile phone or tablet probably is using a Arm chip or an Arm-designed chip.They're increasingly trying to move into other areas. Those include things like laptops, as well as servers, though that's pretty limited as far as their overall share goes. They're more focused on the mobile side of things. So as much as we'll see them talk about low power compute, that's something they talk about when it comes to the laptops and desktop kind of thing. It really is still all about mobile phones for them.And so, you know, this IPO is coming at almost a strange time as we're seeing the slowdown in smartphone sales across the globe. Apple warning about a slowdown. And so, you know, and that's even going into a quarter or two where we'll start to see the impact of the newest iPhone.So we'll have to wait to see what that looks like in the coming months, just as we potentially see people start to pick back up in purchasing those devices. But for Arm, it does come at an off time for the market.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

(PHM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-attracting-investor-215318177.html,1692741198,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this homebuilder have returned -0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has lost 6.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +32.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.62 points to a change of +7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +24.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +0.8% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +26.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.3 billion and $17.36 billion estimates indicate +0.4% and +6.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

151,e0beb1d5-ad05-3f59-88ab-817a74b54189,PHM,2023-08-23,5 Lucrative PEG-Based GARP Stocks for Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-lucrative-peg-based-garp-120200817.html,1692705720,STORY,"['HSBA.L', 'HSBC', 'PHM', 'OSK', 'EHC']","[A pure-play value investor often misses the chance to bet on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. In the same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. Going by Warren Buffett, these two approaches are joined at the hip.Accordingly, some investors sought to join the bridge between value and growth with a hybrid strategy of investment. Their theory suggests that to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investment, often known as a special case of value investment, is gaining popularity. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here, we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Perdoceo Education Corporation PRDO, Encompass Health EHC, Oshkosh Corporation OSK, HSBC HSBC and PulteGroup PHM.A Few More Words on GARPOne of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Story continuesHowever, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are witnessing a rise in earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, “on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.”Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $800 Million (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Perdoceo: This company’s accredited academic institutions offer quality postsecondary education, primarily online, to a diverse student population, along with campus-based and blended learning programs. Perdoceo’s academic institutions offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today’s busy adults.Perdoceo is an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Perdoceo also has an impressive long-term historical growth rate of 24.3%.Encompass Health: As a provider of integrated healthcare services, Encompass Health offers facility-based patient care through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. With a national footprint that includes 158 hospitals across 36 states and Puerto Rico, the company delivers high-quality, cost-effective and integrated care in the healthcare space.Encompass Health can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 11.8%.

We all have a desire to buy or build our own home at some point in our life to live with our family. It is something that will always be a goal for each of us, and therefore is a stock option that will always have some bounce back to it. Let’s take a look at these three homebuilder stocks present incredible opportunities for this month of August.PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comImagine walking into a home that has never been lived in, where every corner holds the promise of new beginnings. PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), one of America’s leading homebuilders, specializes in bringing these brand new homes to life. If you’re looking for a newly built home, this company may be the answer.Investors take note, PulteGroup shines for several reasons. Its financial results alone boast an impressive 8% increase in home sales revenue to a staggering $4.1 billion. In addition, more homes have found new owners, with a 5% increase in closed sales. Even better, the median sales price increased 3%, indicating steady demand and an ability to sell at favorable prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut numbers are not the only thing that defines PulteGroup. They wear their heart on their sleeve through their Built to Honor program, which gives away mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans. This demonstrates not only their good business sense, but also their strong ethical and social values.Expanding their horizons, they have recently set foot in South Carolina, establishing vibrant communities in Greenville and Columbia under the Pulte Homes banner. Take Indigo Park in Easley, for example, where a variety of home designs, starting at $334,990, are attracting new residents. Indeed, I think PulteGroup is a top option in homebuilder stocks. While it has a low valuation now, its long-term projection seems highly promising.Story continuesKB Homes (KBH)KB Home logo at headquarters building. KBH stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockVisualize KB Homes (NYSE:KBH) as a master craftsman, skillfully painting the landscapes of communities across the country. Their expertise lies in transforming plots of land into thriving neighborhoods, a testament to their building prowess.Their latest venture has brought them together with the National Forest Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to safeguarding national forests. Together they promote sustainability by replanting forests and ensuring the longevity of these ecosystems for generations.They are more than builders, they are stewards of the environment. Their commitment to eco-efficient homes has earned them recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The awards celebrate their leadership in creating ENERGY STAR certified homes in several markets.But let’s get to the numbers, reported revenues of $1.77 billion, accompanied by earnings per share of $1.94. The sale of 3,936 homes during the period under review further illustrates its success. Beyond that, KB Home flexes its financial muscle by repurchasing 2.2 million shares worth $92 million, while raising its book value per share to $46.72. While the company still has some growing to do, it’s clearly one of the best undervalued homebuilder stocks to buy right now.LGI Homes (LGIH)Located in the Mojave Desert City of Victorville, California, a feather flag sign for LGI Homes with text of New Homes - 0% Down. (LGIH)Source: Felipe Sanchez / Shutterstock.comAt the heart of the homebuilding world is LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), dedicated to the art of creating new residences. They are the visionaries behind the scenes, designing and building homes where families create memories.Investors with an eye on the real estate market will find promise in them. In the second quarter of 2023 they earned net income of $53.1 million, which translates to $2.26 per share for holders of basic shares and $2.25 per share for holders of diluted shares. Notably, they also earned pre-tax income of $71.4 million.In terms of operations, income from home sales amounted to$645.3 million, resulting in the sale of 1,854 homes during the period. With an average sales price per home of $348,042, the market values its supply.And let’s talk about profitability, a solid 22% gross margin relative to home sales revenue. When adjustments are taken into account, the adjusted gross margin rises to 23.8%, demonstrating its skillful cost management and efficient profitability.As of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:BAX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.29 per share on the 2nd of October. This makes the dividend yield 2.8%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Baxter International Baxter International's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. While Baxter International is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 7.5%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.80 total annually to $1.16. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 4.3% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Baxter International's earnings per share has shrunk at 48% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Baxter International's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

155,5a09a251-883c-37e9-8eab-2704bdf9ccf7,BAX,2023-08-23,Long-Term Returns of Dan Loeb’s Activist Targets,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-term-returns-dan-loeb-140254775.html,1692712974,STORY,"['TPNTF', 'NSRGF', 'BAX', 'EMMS', 'CPB', 'ENPH', 'SHEL']","[In this article, we discuss long-term returns of Dan Loeb's activist targets. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long-Term Returns of Dan Loeb's 5 Activist Targets.Dan Loeb is one of the most successful hedge fund managers. The Founder of New York-based Third Point LLC, which manages nearly $14 billion in assets, has made a name for himself as an activist investor. Some of his big wins on Wall Street have come from launching activist campaigns against corporate boards and shaking up companies in various industries and countries.Over the years, the hedge fund manager has relied on grassroots campaigning techniques in the race to unlock full value in some plays on Wall Street. The technique entails letter writing that goes a long way in influencing company management and triggering investors’ reactions. With a net worth of about $3.5 billion, there was a time Loeb was best known for lambasting CEOs and directors with public letters and anonymously on websites.While his battles with corporate boards often turned nasty, they often bore fruit in unlocking unseen value. Loeb and his fund have been advocates of the technique, which helps high-quality firms unlock their true growth potential by pursuing new opportunities and markets. Loeb has enjoyed tremendous success by pushing management teams to look deeper at their businesses and implement changes that lead to greater long-term value. Such activist campaigns have often resulted in mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and management changes.In 2015, he was forced to defend his activist investment strategy after facing criticism from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In his letter to investors, he insisted the criticism was outdated as his stratify was far better than the corporate raider of the 1980s.Likewise, Loeb has kept up with the stock market's rise with his activism in various companies, depicted by Third Point's annualized return of just under 16% since its inception. Investment in medical supplies company Baxter International bore fruits with returns of over 45% in 2017.Story continuesThe activist investor also made waves by taking a position on DowDuPont and started pushing to have the company split into Dow and DuPont. Eventually, the company did spin off its materials science Division into Dow Company after Loeb had said it had the potential to unlock up to $20 billion value.In 2020 Third Point took out a position in chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and pushed the company to attract fresh talent to reinvigorate its growth prospects. With the company struggling to create technological advantages and playing catch-up with rivals, the CEO had to go and was replaced in 2021 by Pat Gelsinger. These changes didn't help Intel much as the stock lost a third of its value since Loeb's involvement.In the recent past, Loeb has reiterated that he sees nearly $1 trillion of untapped value in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) through its e-commerce and Amazon Web Services cloud unit. While it is still unclear whether Loeb will be pursuing an activist campaign against Amazon, things could change as the stock is one of Third Point's most significant holdings, valued at over $784 million.In addition, to activist campaigns, the hedge fund manager has recently lamented how meme stock traders have made short selling a problematic job. The meme crowd often drives stocks up, all to squeeze short sellers, of which Third Point is also a player.“Fundamental analysis is increasingly taking a back seat to monitoring daily option expiries and RedDirt message boards, as evidenced by the numerous short squeezes and manipulations of heavily shorted stocks such as AMC and GameStop in 2021 and others this year,” Third Point LLC’s chief executive wrote.For instance, Tupperware Brands Corporation (NYSE:TUP), Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA), and Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL) prices have been pumped up, sticking short sellers with losses of over $400 million over the past two months. Concerned by the meme crowd and tactics, Loeb has reiterated that his days as a big gambler against individual stocks are over. Long-Term Returns of Dan Loeb's Activist TargetsDan Loeb of Third PointCompared to previous years, Loeb is having a challenging 2023, with his fund lagging the broad market by about 20%. Third Point was only up by 1.1% in the second quarter bringing its 2023 losses to 3%. The underperformance stems from underinvestment in the magnificent 7 stocks of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NYSE:TSLA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) that have been in fine form year round.“Managers who have had less than 25% of their funds in these stocks have found it challenging to keep up with ‘the market,” Loeb told his investors.Nevertheless, the hedge fund manager has ramped up his position on Amazon, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the recent past after lamenting on missing out big on the tech rally boom.Our MethodologyThere is no doubt that Loeb is one of the most successful hedge fund managers. He has always deployed capital in world-class companies trading at bargain basement prices. However, his returns have always varied depending on the company, the industry, and prevailing market conditions. While some picks have performed beyond expectations, others have proved to be big disappointments.We have compiled a list of some of Loeb’s biggest activist plays and their returns over the years. The stocks have been compiled from the SEC filings. The stocks are ranked chronologically from when the activist investor Loeb bought stakes in the company and embarked on a proxy fight.Long-Term Returns of Dan Loeb's Activist Targets15.

Loeb's Third Point hedge fund developed a 7.9% stake in the company in 2005 and embarked on a proxy battle to unlock value.Activist investor Dan Loeb saw Emmis Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:EMMS) as undervalued, given its strong market position and opportunities to improve its profitability. He demanded seats on the board and the appointment of new CEO Jeffrey Smulyan, who had announced plans to take the company private.

Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation was created in 1998 by merging two industry leaders: Stone Container Corporation and Jefferson Smurfit Corporation. In 2011, Third Point LLC was part of a consortium of activist investors that came together to block the company's proposed takeover for $3.5 billion by Rock Ten Co.The hedge funds argued that the deal substantially undervalued the company and would not generate optimum shareholder value. The deal valued the company at $35 a share. The deal closed in May of 2011, and Loeb generated a return of 54.1%.13. Yahoo Inc.Stock Return: 114% Activist Investment: 2011Yahoo is a web portal and online media company that offers various services such as emails, news, search, and social networking.

He criticized the board for its lack of digital strategy, focus on high-value lots, and failure to compete against Google on advertising.He demanded the resignation of Scott Thompson, who was replaced by Marissa Mayer in 2012. Loeb's activist campaign paid off as a year later; the company announced plans to buy nearly two-thirds of his shares at a market price of $29.11, translating to a 114% gain on the investment.12. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Stock Return: 1800% Activist Investment: 2012Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells home energy solutions for the solar photovoltaic industry.

Through Third Point, the hedge fund manager increased stakes in the company and became the largest shareholder with a 14.35% stake.The acquisition came as Loeb saw Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) undervalued, given its solid global franchise and opportunities to boost profit margins. He consequently pushed for two board seats and pushed for a new CEO. His activism helped improve the company's operation efficiency, capital allocation and corporate governance. He also pushed for acquisitions, including SunPower's microinverter business, in 2018.Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has turned out to be one of Loeb’s greatest investments, with gains of over 1800% over the past ten years.11.

As part of his activism, Loeb called for the resignation of CEO William Ruprecht, who he believed was being overpaid.Loeb lodged a proxy fight and won three board seats in Sotheby’s (NYSE:BID). He remained one of the largest shareholders until 2019, when the company agreed to be acquired.In 2019, Patrick Drahi acquired the company for $3.7 billion, going private and ceasing to trade in the New York Stock Exchange. The sale created a windfall for the activist investor, seeing his investment appreciate by about 40%.10. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Stock Return: 106% Activist Investment: 2015Through its subsidiaries, Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) designs, develops and markets a portfolio of healthcare products.

The hedge fund also pushed for a spinoff of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)’s biopharmaceutical division to unlock maximum shareholder value.In 2018 Third Point sold a 22.1% stake in Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) at $68.62 a share for a gain of 106%.9.

(NYSE:NSRGY) must do more to reshape its product portfolio and adapt to changing consumer tastes and competition. Barely a year later, had Loeb penned a 34-page presentation urging the board to sell more of the business that does not fit and untangle its corporate structure?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss and break down the market technicals of health care stocks.Woods says he focuses on those four health care stocks, ""because they're in Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I give you health care.""The Health Care Select Sector (XLV) ""continues to make higher lows, as it goes along,"" Woods notes. ""If you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety sector,"" Woods says.Video Transcript- I know you have some picks in health care. Surprisingly, Pfizer not making your cut, though, Jay. So walk us through your base case. You've got UnitedHealth, Merck, J&amp;J, and Amgen, but not Pfizer.JAY WOODS: Well, I definitely don't have Pfizer. Pfizer has been a dog in the sector. And I focused on those four stocks. Why? Because they're in a Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I'll give you health care. The health care sector continues to make high or lows as it goes along.- There's health care.JAY WOODS: All right, so what do we see here? We see nice continued high or lows. Every time it sells off, it continues to get a little higher and it's consolidating in here.- Jay, I want to stop you for a second. Here's a 10-year chart, and I'm going to put some candlesticks back on. This is like-- I would call this a rare diamond formation. This is just consolidation in terms of a long-term secular trend, it looks like.JAY WOODS: Well, the diamond formation could be a negative. This is a debate in the technical analysis community, because sometimes this is a key reversal where you see come down. I, however, yes, I do see the diamond, but the way the underlying stocks, the stocks within the index, the UNHs of the world, which is the biggest component of the Dow because the Dow--Story continues- Look at UnitedHealth, very similar chart to XLV. This is 10 years, but I'm going to dial this down to a year to date and we can switch that as well.JAY WOODS: Yeah, UnitedHealthcare has been consolidating. It tested the 450 area here twice. And if you go back further in time, it's tested it several times. So we have a nice double bottom. It rallied above it. It's now above its 200 day moving average, and it can still run another 50 points and still be in this consolidation zone that we've seen. 50 points in UNH is another 300 Dow points. I think that's what we're going to see from it over the near term. And if you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety-- safety sector. So I think it's going to see some action.- Two more. We got Merck and Amgen. I don't know if we have time for both, but start with Merck.JAY WOODS: Let's focus on Merck because Merck is playing out seasonally just like it had last year. We had some consolidating periods where we've seen drop offs. And what has it done? It's rallied year in. The stock is flat year to date. Over the last 12 months, it's up about 25%. But year to date, it's flat.If people are looking for performance, if they're looking for something strong within the sector, it's not only in the Dow. It's a major impact on the XLV and the stock should rally into year end based on what we've seen before. And the fact that it's still making higher lows, I'm not very good at drawing with my finger, obviously, but it looks like in this consolidation period above 105, I still like Merck, and I think it's still bullish.- All right, Rochelle, any more?- Well, I was going to say, for people who are perhaps not familiar with some of the terms like diamond formation, what is the best way for them to sort of view some of the changes that they're seeing here?- Love it. Trader education.JAY WOODS: Trader education, risk management obviously number one-- rule number one, number two, number three when trading. When you get into the trade, you want to have levels. If this doesn't work out, like I just said in Merck, 105 something has changed to me. And I will take that loss, I will limit that loss.The formations are fun to follow, but I look for continuation patterns, and I'm seeing setups that can show continuation to the upside. So the risk reward set up to me in these stocks and in the sector is definitely bullish.- Jay, we got to go. Really appreciate you. Anybody who wants to learn about trading, also follow Jay Woods on Twitter, your handle.JAY WOODS: @ JayWoods3.- There you go. Rochelle.]"

Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 1.8% to $2.61 billion.Adjusted operating margin expanded 163 bps year over year to 23.3%GuidanceMedtronic raised fiscal 2024 guidance.Fiscal 2024 organic revenue growth is expected to be 4.5% (up from the earlier guided range of 4-4.5%). The organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue related to certain businesses reported as Other. If foreign currency exchange rates as of the beginning of August hold, FY24 revenue growth on a reported basis would be approximately 2.75%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 worldwide revenues is pegged at $32.16 billion.The full-year adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $5.08 to $5.16 (previous guided range was $5.00- $5.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.05.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal first quarter. The company's organic revenue results reflect broad strength across businesses and geographies, driven by execution, innovation, and improved underlying fundamentals. During the quarter, the company received CE Mark approval for the company's next-generation Inceptiv spinal cord stimulator with closed-loop sensing. Within Neiuroscience, Specialty Therapies results were driven by high-teens growth in ENT aided by supply improvement, low-single digit growth in Neurovascular, and low-single digit declines in Pelvic Health. Raised fiscal 2024 guidance looks encouraging. However, macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc.

Its product portfolio includes pacemakers, defibrillators, heart valves, stents, insulin pumps, spinal fixation devices, neurovascular products, advanced energy, and surgical tools. The company markets its products to healthcare institutions and physicians in the United States and overseas, with foreign sales accounting for roughly 50% of the company's total sales.With a current stock price of $83.9 per share and a market cap of $111.70 billion, Medtronic PLC's valuation compared to its fair value (GF Value) of $108.76 presents an interesting discussion on the company's intrinsic value.Medtronic PLC: A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.Medtronic PLC's stock shows signs of being modestly undervalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Medtronic PLC: A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it is crucial to evaluate its financial strength.

The company's profitability is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.However, growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Medtronic PLC is 3.1%, which ranks worse than 61.13% of 723 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Medtronic PLC's ROIC was 5.45, while its WACC came in at 6.44.Medtronic PLC: A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsConclusionIn conclusion, Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) stock shows signs of being modestly undervalued.

171,617b1ff8-d83f-3d92-b4a5-1fff7fd97e5e,MRK,2023-08-23,12 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-undervalued-blue-chip-214656405.html,1692740816,STORY,"['^DJI', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'DIS', 'CVX', 'MRK', 'AXP', 'V', 'NKE', 'MSFT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. If you want to see which blue chip stocks haven't done well this year, then you can check out 15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. Some top stock picks in the list of undervalued blue chip stocks favored by hedge funds are Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).12 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we ranked blue chip stocks by their share price upside in percentage based on analyst average share price targets. Then, the number of hedge fund investors in the top 20 companies was determined for the funds' second quarter of 2023 investment portfolio, and the top 12 stocks are listed below.12 Most Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12.

If you want to skip our introduction to insider trading and Mr. Fisher then skip to Ken Fisher's and Insiders' 5 Stock Picks.Insider trading is often thought to be illegal. The most commonly understood definition of insider trading, and one that is also against the law, is trading the shares of a firm based on non publicly available information. As an example, if your uncle worked at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and he told you that during its upcoming earnings call the firm will announce a shut down of U.S. manufacturing, and you used this information to buy Put options before the earnings to profit from a drop in the share price, then this would be insider trading. Depending on the scale of your trade, the SEC might fine you and your uncle or even send you to jail.However, another variety of insider trading is legal. This involves the purchasing or selling of a firm's shares by its management or large investors, and the transactions are reported on a publicly traded firm's SEC page and the purchases are often evaluated by investors to gauge what these people, which generally have a deeper insight into the firm's operations, are thinking about their company. At the same time, management, and particularly top level executives such as chief executive officers also buy shares to project their confidence in their firm's prospects to potentially assuage any large investor concerns that might be present.The lucrative nature of the stock market and the potential it offers to make millions means that even though insider trading is illegal, it will most likely never go away. It continues to generate headlines in the media, and recently, one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading companies in the world is finding itself on its web. This firm is none other than the embattled cryptocurrency trading platform Binance, whose chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has stopped all Binance employees from engaging in any form of futures trading. Additionally, the company has a new policy in place that now require employees from holding their investments for at least 90 days, which is aimed to stop them from profiteering in the short term on the basis of information that might be unavailable to the broader public.Story continuesAt the same time, while Binance might not be facing any legal action against insider trading, one publicly traded firm that is facing an insider trading lawsuit is Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG). The growth in online learning after the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the demand for such platforms, and at the same time, it has also allowed unscrupulous students to cheat on their tests or use other unfair advantages to distort their academic results. This has landed the CEO of San Francisco 49ers Mr. Jed York at the center of a lawsuit against Chegg which claims that not only did the company profit from college students using it to cheat on their exams, but that Mr. York and other directors sold stock while the shares were at their peak without informing investors about the scale of the fraud that was being conducted through Chegg. The company's shares were trading at $113 in February 2021 when online education was at its peak but then lost their luster as in person classes resumed. Mr. York is accused of making a cool $1.4 million from inflated share prices, and for its part, Chegg has denied any wrongdoing as it claims that it is ""vigorously defending itself"" from the allegations.While insider purchases provide one way to determine if a stock might appreciate in the future, another popular method of sifting through the thousands of companies on the stock market is by taking a look at what hedge funds are doing. After all, these are professionals who spend most of their day pouring over anything and everything related to the stock market, so their decision carry a lot of weight as well. One of the most successful hedge fund investors of all time is the billionaire founder of Fisher Investments Mr. Ken Fisher. Having spent decades on the stock market, Mr. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, and he often has remarkable insights into the market that are based purely on the key determinants of market health such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth instead of the chatter that often clouds the truth behind what can take place in the future. He was one of the few investors that was actually bullish last year, and we all know how that played out as markets stunned everyone in 2023 to produce double digit returns. So naturally, his words have a lot of weight to them, and as to what he thinks will happen in the future, here's a glimpse inside his mind about the rest of the year:Let me just say that all these sentiment features lead to pessimism. And as a bull market begins, there's this feature that I've talked about before that I call the Pessimism of Disbelief, which is the tendency of people to get more pessimistic as the market starts to go up. Where maybe we had a bottom in June, the middle of June, on June 14. Maybe we had a bottom, depending on how you measure it, which indexes you look at in July, the stocks are higher either way. And when you think about these things, it is normal. I'm not saying those were the bottom. I don't really know.But it is normal when you have a bear market make a bottom and start to go up for people to keep getting more pessimistic as it goes up. The pessimism leads to future positive surprise which becomes doubly bullish fully buoying the bull market.And you should view today's sentiment as the precursor to higher prices ahead without any precise timing of whether we've had the bottom, the bottom still a little bit ahead. What's going on? That negative sentiment is not consistent with a world that's about to fall apart. It's more consistent with a world that's already seen its stock market bottom and is starting to rise and the Pessimism of Disbelief builds.So, you get yes buts to all positivity, all new things that come along better than people feared as people keep looking for the bad that looking for the bad is a good. And you should view sentiment in that way because negative sentiment is one of the most bullish features you can get.So, we decided to take a look at some stocks that are both the top picks of Ken Fisher and have seen insider activity lately. The top picks are The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).Billionaire Ken Fisher and Corporate Insiders Are Betting On These StocksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset ManagementOur Methodology To compile our list of stocks that both Ken Fisher and insiders love, we use his second quarter of 2023 portfolio and scanned them for insider purchases through Insider Monkey's screener.

Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss and break down the market technicals of health care stocks.Woods says he focuses on those four health care stocks, ""because they're in Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I give you health care.""The Health Care Select Sector (XLV) ""continues to make higher lows, as it goes along,"" Woods notes. ""If you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety sector,"" Woods says.Video Transcript- I know you have some picks in health care. Surprisingly, Pfizer not making your cut, though, Jay. So walk us through your base case. You've got UnitedHealth, Merck, J&amp;J, and Amgen, but not Pfizer.JAY WOODS: Well, I definitely don't have Pfizer. Pfizer has been a dog in the sector. And I focused on those four stocks. Why? Because they're in a Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I'll give you health care. The health care sector continues to make high or lows as it goes along.- There's health care.JAY WOODS: All right, so what do we see here? We see nice continued high or lows. Every time it sells off, it continues to get a little higher and it's consolidating in here.- Jay, I want to stop you for a second. Here's a 10-year chart, and I'm going to put some candlesticks back on. This is like-- I would call this a rare diamond formation. This is just consolidation in terms of a long-term secular trend, it looks like.JAY WOODS: Well, the diamond formation could be a negative. This is a debate in the technical analysis community, because sometimes this is a key reversal where you see come down. I, however, yes, I do see the diamond, but the way the underlying stocks, the stocks within the index, the UNHs of the world, which is the biggest component of the Dow because the Dow--Story continues- Look at UnitedHealth, very similar chart to XLV. This is 10 years, but I'm going to dial this down to a year to date and we can switch that as well.JAY WOODS: Yeah, UnitedHealthcare has been consolidating. It tested the 450 area here twice. And if you go back further in time, it's tested it several times. So we have a nice double bottom. It rallied above it. It's now above its 200 day moving average, and it can still run another 50 points and still be in this consolidation zone that we've seen. 50 points in UNH is another 300 Dow points. I think that's what we're going to see from it over the near term. And if you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety-- safety sector. So I think it's going to see some action.- Two more. We got Merck and Amgen. I don't know if we have time for both, but start with Merck.JAY WOODS: Let's focus on Merck because Merck is playing out seasonally just like it had last year. We had some consolidating periods where we've seen drop offs. And what has it done? It's rallied year in. The stock is flat year to date. Over the last 12 months, it's up about 25%. But year to date, it's flat.If people are looking for performance, if they're looking for something strong within the sector, it's not only in the Dow. It's a major impact on the XLV and the stock should rally into year end based on what we've seen before. And the fact that it's still making higher lows, I'm not very good at drawing with my finger, obviously, but it looks like in this consolidation period above 105, I still like Merck, and I think it's still bullish.- All right, Rochelle, any more?- Well, I was going to say, for people who are perhaps not familiar with some of the terms like diamond formation, what is the best way for them to sort of view some of the changes that they're seeing here?- Love it. Trader education.JAY WOODS: Trader education, risk management obviously number one-- rule number one, number two, number three when trading. When you get into the trade, you want to have levels. If this doesn't work out, like I just said in Merck, 105 something has changed to me. And I will take that loss, I will limit that loss.The formations are fun to follow, but I look for continuation patterns, and I'm seeing setups that can show continuation to the upside. So the risk reward set up to me in these stocks and in the sector is definitely bullish.- Jay, we got to go. Really appreciate you. Anybody who wants to learn about trading, also follow Jay Woods on Twitter, your handle.JAY WOODS: @ JayWoods3.- There you go. Rochelle.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of new developments in the weight loss industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Weight Loss Stocks To Invest In.US Versus Peer Nations In Weight Loss Drug PricesPhysical fitness and weight loss are two things most individuals would have wanted to inculcate in their everyday lives at one point. Working on one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits, making the weight loss and fitness market relatively large across the globe. This includes anything from fitness products and equipment providers to weight loss drug manufacturers and distributors. The providers of these products and services stand to gain quite a bit from the focus on fitness and weight loss that is so publicly widespread today. As such, the weight loss market, and the more specialized weight loss drug market within it, are steadily becoming viable investment options for many investors.According to survey results released by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and the Kaiser Family Foundation on August 17, about 50% of adults in the US ""would be interested in taking prescription weight loss drugs."" This signifies that the market for weight loss drugs in the US is not suffering from demand in the least. However, the analysis presented by Peterson-KFF shows that the list prices for weight loss drugs in the US are significantly higher than those in peer nations such as Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and Germany, among more. For instance, the Mounjaro drug produced by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is priced at a whopping $1,023 in the US, while the same drug is priced at $319 in Japan. This massive price difference makes the situation of the US weight loss market slightly worrying because it is resulting in many insurers dropping weight loss treatments from their list of insurance-covered healthcare treatments. At the same time, these drugs are too expensive for a regular American to pay for out of pocket, making them inaccessible to the general public who needs them.Story continuesThe Weight Loss Industry Gold RushDespite the above, companies that are actively working on providing weight loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), or those that are contributing to this space through introducing weight management interventions, like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), are still managing to profit considerably. For example, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) reported that its second-quarter revenue increased by 28% ""as a result of volume-driven growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz."" The company's Chair and CEO, David A. Ricks, commented that its second-quarter results were led by sales of its obesity drug, Mounjaro, alongside a strong performance from its Growth Products.Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is also trying its best to bank on the weight loss drug demand and is making moves to broaden its own weight loss portfolio. The company's Ozempic and Wegovy drugs are rapidly gaining popularity across the globe and on Wall Street. According to a Wall Street Journal article from this June, these drugs helped adults in a trial lose about 15.1% of their body weight in 68 weeks. Additionally, on August 10, CNBC reported that Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) announced its upcoming acquisition of Inversago Pharma, which is a private obesity drug-making company, for up to $1.08 billion. The acquisition is expected to be closed before the end of the year, and the final price for Inversago Pharma was said to depend on whether it ""reaches certain development and sales goals."" This acquisition is just one more step the company is taking to further capitalize on the ""weight loss industry gold rush,"" considering the fact that it is already benefitting spectacularly from its involvement in this space. This is substantiated by Novo Nordisk A/S' (NYSE:NVO) report of its second-quarter sales this August, where the company stated that sales within its Diabetes and Obesity Care business increased by 36% during the second quarter.These companies are not alone in their weight loss drug operations. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has also been testing two oral drugs and has announced that it will be moving forward with its danuglipron drug, presumably in an effort to not be left behind in the weight loss drug race. All in all, it is evident that despite existing problems within the weight loss market in the US, companies operating in this space are continuing to do well because of higher demand for weight loss products, treatments, and services. In light of the above, we have compiled a list of some of the best weight loss stocks to invest in. This list includes some top weight loss drug stocks alongside some of the other best weight loss companies in the world.11 Best Weight Loss Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe selected the best weight loss stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”8.

Moreover, it's projected that AI could increase US labor productivity by 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points by 2030. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation is swiftly revolutionizing businesses across various sectors. In 2021, the automation market size was valued at $177.75 billion and is expected to reach $441.7 billion by 2023. Unlike manual workers, robots are faster, more robust, and can work tirelessly 24/7. This reflects the time freed up by automation for humans. For example, implementing AI-powered automation can seamlessly handle repetitive tasks like customer service chatbots and data entry. This, in turn, allows employees to focus on more creative and strategic work. AI can also create new opportunities for businesses to improve productivity, efficiency, and customer service. For instance, AI can improve decision-making through machine learning techniques that dissect data and discern patterns. This proves invaluable in aiding businesses to make well-informed pricing, marketing, and product innovation choices. Congress is planning to increase the amount of money spent on AI research and development (R&amp;D). They want to double the funding each year until it reaches $32 billion by 2026. The Biden Administration is also suggesting a bigger budget for R&amp;D in 2023, with a total of more than $204 billion. This is a 28% increase from what was approved in 2021. Some of this money will go towards supporting new and existing research institutes focused on artificial intelligence and automation. These institutes bring together government agencies, private companies, nonprofits, and schools to work on AI projects.Story continuesAutomation is the need of every lucrative industry. Its trans-mutative power is taking industries to unprecedented success and efficiency by saving time and revolutionizing operations.

176,b08123df-5ad0-3fdb-b17e-85ff5bf2548f,BA,2023-08-23,INSIGHT-How Russia keeps its fleet of Western jets in the air,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-russia-keeps-fleet-western-064004121.html,1692772804,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY', 'NOC']","[By David Gauthier-Villars and Gleb StolyarovDUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A Ural Airlines Airbus landed in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg on Nov. 14 last year. Then it remained grounded on the tarmac.Three days later, a spare part crucial for navigation systems with a declared value of over a quarter of a million dollars, made by U.S. company Northrop Grumman, arrived for the jet, Russian customs records show.A week later, on Nov. 24, the A320 took off for Moscow and has been busy ferrying passengers across Russia and Central Asia ever since, according to flight tracking data.Despite Western sanctions designed to stop Russian carriers from procuring parts for their Airbus and Boeing jets, Ural Airlines has imported over 20 of the U.S.-made devices since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the customs data show.All told, at least $1.2 billion worth of aircraft parts flowed to Russian airlines from May last year - when most U.S. and European trade curbs and export bans over Ukraine were in force - to the end of June this year, a Reuters analysis of the customs records shows.The equipment ranged from essential items needed to keep a jet airworthy - such as the Northrop Grumman devices, cabin pressure valves, cockpit displays and landing gear - to more mundane spares, such as coffee makers, flight attendant telephone handsets and toilet seats.The customs records showed the parts made their way to Russia through middlemen in countries including Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkey, China and Kyrgyzstan – none of which has endorsed Western sanctions on Russia.The $1.2 billion tally underestimates the total value of aircraft parts imported during the period reviewed by Reuters as it only includes shipments destined directly for Russian airlines or their maintenance units - and not plane parts shipped to other companies in Russia.Oleg Panteleev, head of the AviaPort aviation think-tank in Moscow, said Russian airlines have ""solved the problem"" of operating under Western sanctions.Story continues""At first there was a shock, no one knew what to do,"" he told Reuters. ""After two to three months, new supply channels were found and, after six or nine months, quite a lot of alternatives appeared, which allowed for a reduction in prices and delivery times.""'UNNECESSARY INFORMATION'Ural Airlines Deputy Chief Executive Kirill Skuratov declined to comment on how the Russian carrier procured its spare parts. ""I definitely will not tell you that,"" he told Reuters. ""It is unnecessary information.""After reviewing the list compiled by Reuters, Northrop Grumman said it did not identify any sales or repair services by the company to Russian entities. Northrop Grumman said it has ""robust processes and procedures to help ensure compliance with all applicable export and sanctions-related laws and regulations.""The U.S. government said its export controls and those of its allies had severely affected the Russian aviation sector.""We will continue to vigorously enforce our controls by rooting out and disrupting illicit networks, pursuing individuals evading restrictions, and directly engaging with industry and foreign governments to ensure compliance,"" a Department of Commerce spokesperson said.A European Union official said the bloc was closely coordinating with countries that had imposed similar trade curbs to ensure they were not circumvented.""Systems are being put in place in some countries for monitoring, controlling and blocking re-exports,"" the official said.To be sure, Western sanctions have made life more difficult for Russia's aviation sector.In mid 2022, aviation industry sources described how some Russian airlines were stripping some planes for parts. And Russian carrier S7 Airlines said in June last year that it had to scrap plans to launch a low-cost operator because it could not take delivery of the Airbus planes it had ordered.Like its U.S. rival Boeing, the European planemaker cut links with its Russian clients when sanctions kicked in.But as of May 1 this year, Russian carriers had 541 Western planes in active service or under maintenance, according to data compiled by Swiss aviation intelligence provider ch-aviation. That's more or less on a par with before the war, taking into account the 75 planes being leased by Russian airlines that were repossessed by their foreign owners, the ch-aviation data show.Russian airlines carried 10.1 million passengers in June, according to Russia's federal statistics agency Rosstat, compared to 8.87 million in June 2022 and 11.1 million in June 2021.Without Western aircraft, Russian airlines would have had to downsize massively because they only have about 150 Russian-made passenger planes in their fleets, according to ch-aviation data.Russia's trade ministry and civil aviation authority did not respond to messages seeking comment.CIRCUITOUS ROUTEBefore the trade restrictions, Ural Airlines, Aeroflot , S7 and other Russian carriers relied on maintenance support from global firms such as Lufthansa Technik of Germany.When those firms stopped providing services – Lufthansa Technik said it suspended sales to Russia from Feb. 28, 2022 – Russian airlines turned to a pool of far smaller suppliers.In April 2022, for example, S7's maintenance unit, S7 Engineering, began importing parts from a company in Moldova called Air Rock Solutions, according to the customs records.The first shipment was for water filters for Airbus galleys with a declared value of $1,700. Over the next 14 months, S7 received at least $1.23 million of parts from Air Rock, the records show.Ivan Melnicov, chief executive of Air Rock and another aircraft parts distributor in Moldova called Aerostage Services, denied selling products to Russia. He said most of his clients were in the UAE and Kyrgyzstan, among others.""Business with Russian companies is impossible to be done from Moldova, simply considering that their banks are banned in Moldova and payments are not processed,"" Melnicov told Reuters. ""We are not interested in losing our local and international partners for short-term income.""Most of the shipments listed in Russian customs records as having been made by Air Rock and Aerostage took circuitous routes, transiting through the UAE or Kyrgyzstan. Asked if that could indicate his clients in those countries had re-routed deliveries to Russian airlines, the Moldovan businessman did not respond.S7 and Aeroflot did not respond to messages seeking comment.NOSE TO TAIL SERVICESThe serial number listed in Russian customs records for the Northrop Grumman device sent to Yekaterinburg last year shows the part was manufactured in October 2008, and used on different aircraft, including one in Saudi Arabia six year ago, according to an industry source with access to maintenance databases.While the customs records don't name the company that shipped the device in November, they do show how more of the same crucial U.S. parts fitted with high-tech laser gyroscopes reached Urals Airlines during the 14-month period reviewed by Reuters.In July 2022, for example, one was shipped to Ural Airlines via the UAE by Istikloliyat 20, a civil engineering company based in Tajikistan. In September 2022, another Tajik civil engineering firm, Kafolati Komil, also sent one of the parts to Russia via the UAE, the data show.Mahmadbashir Yakubov, chief executive of Istikloliyat 20, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. Reuters was unable to reach Komilchon Yakubov, the chief executive of Kafolati Komil.Some of the shipments of Northrop Grumman parts to Ural Airlines that went through the UAE were handled by a company named Skyparts FZCO, the customs records show.Created in June 2022 and registered in a single-room office in one of Dubai's free economic zones, Skyparts says on its website it was founded by aviation professionals and offers customers ""nose to tail"" support for their aircraft.Asked about the shipments of the Northrop Grumman device, Skyparts manager Saeed Abdulloev told Reuters he was familiar with the part and confirmed that the Dubai firm was doing business with Tajik companies, including Istikloliyat 20.He said Skyparts had procured one of the Northrop Grumman parts from a U.S. supplier but denied ever sending it to Russia. He declined to identify the U.S. firm.HUSBAND AND WIFEOne Russian carrier, Nordwind Airlines, appears to have harnessed family ties to procure parts for the 12 Airbus and 15 Boeing aircraft in its fleet, the customs data show.Owned by Russian entrepreneur Karine Bukrey, according to corporate records, the airline imported hundreds of parts from Ramses Turizm. Based in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, Ramses Turizm is owned by Bukrey's husband, Ramazan Akpinar.Nordwind and Bukrey did not respond to messages seeking comment.Contacted by Reuters on April 4 this year, Akpinar confirmed owning Ramses Turizm and being married to Bukrey. He did not answer questions about aircraft part exports to Nordwind.The Russian records show Nordwind stopped receiving parts from Ramses Turizm three days after Reuters asked about them. However, the airline carried on importing parts from another Turkish company, Na Havacilik ve Teknik, also based in Antalya.Reuters was unable to reach Nusret Alper, who founded Na Havacilik in August 2022, for comment.Nordwind also imported parts via its maintenance unit, NW Technic, according to the customs records. Chief Executive Valery Pashaev told Reuters his unit was solely focused on maintaining aircraft and was not involved in parts procurement.""People bring me parts and tell me where to install them,"" Pashaev said. ""I take the parts and install them.""(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Dubai and Maurice Tamman in New York; Editing by David Clarke and Daniel Flynn)]"

179,0fc21f14-112f-38a2-8c39-606ec7cd0981,CI,2023-08-23,The Cigna Group's (NYSE:CI) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-groups-nyse-ci-stocks-110031861.html,1692788431,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 12% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cigna Group's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Cigna Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna Group is:15% = US$6.8b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Cigna Group's Earnings Growth And 15% ROEAt first glance, Cigna Group seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. This probably laid the ground for Cigna Group's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Cigna Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Cigna Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Cigna Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?In Cigna Group's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (or a retention ratio of 79%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Besides, Cigna Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 17%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 17%.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna Group's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Icahn's activist targets and their historical performance and go directly to read Long-Term Returns of Carl Icahn's 10 Activist Targets. He is one of Wall Street's biggest stars and most successful investors. Carl Icahn is a force to reckon with as an American billionaire, financier, corporate raider, and private equity investor. He rose to prominence in the 1980s on investing in various public companies and demanding extreme corporate leadership and management changes to unlock shareholder value.He has grown to become one of the biggest and most revered activist investors. His moves and calls in the market are often followed by investors who always rely on his activism to unlock significant value in undervalued or sleeping giants. ""Icahn Lift"" is the acronym that often refers to the shareholder value that comes about from Billionaire investor activism.With a network of about $8.4 billion, Icahn dropped out of the New York University School of Medicine and started his long and fruitful career on Wall Street in 1961. He would go on to form Icahn &amp; Co, a securities firm that would engage in various strategies to squeeze in value through risk arbitrage options trading or through other strategies.It was in 1978 that the lone wolf of Wall Street started seizing control of positions in individual companies, including Viacom, Texaco, Philips Petroleum, and Western Union, among others, as part of his activism plays. In 1979 aggressive activism would earn Icahn $3 million on winning a seat on the board of kitchen stove maker Tappan and engineered its sale.Driven by the philosophy of buying something that no one wants has etched his name as a contrarian investor. Icahn mostly focuses on identifying stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios and book values exceeding current valuation.Story continuesAfter purchasing a significant position in the company, he either calls for the election of the entire board or divestiture of assets to unlock shareholder value. Splitting up businesses' and returning cash to shareholders to is one of the strategies he often deploys in the race to unlock shareholder value.In 2015 he succeeded in convincing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), as part of his activism, to increase stock buybacks. The push came after the activist investor had a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, after which he followed with a $150 billion buyback proposal while insisting the market was undervaluing Apple stock.Activism has often put Icahn at crossroads with fellow high-profile investors. No one could ever forget his altercation with fellow activist investor Bill Ackman over the nutrition company Herbalife. As Ackman insisted the company was a fraud and poised to go to zero, he shorted the stock. Icahn, on the other hand, refuted the claims opting to buy large chunks of the stock.Long-Term Returns of Carl Icahn's Activist TargetsCarl Icahn of Icahn CapitalAs the founder and majority owner of Icahn Enterprises, Icahn mostly invests across seven operating segments, including Automotive, pharmaceutical, and home textile. He is also a big player in Tech and energy. In recent years, he has appeared to go slow, leaving his son Brett Icahn as Icahn Capital LP's lead manager, an Icahn Enterprises subsidiary.Contrary to perception, Icahn is not always on the winning side. Shares of Icahn Enterprises losing nearly a fifth of their value after Hindenburg Research announced the holding company was the target of its latest short underscores how things can also get nasty even for the lone wolf of Wall Street.Hindenburg has also accused Icahn Enterprises of using money from new investors to pay out dividends to old ones terming such practices s Ponzi-like economic structures. Icahn, who has spent most of his life making such claims against other companies and investors, has resorted to waving off the claims terming the report self-serving.In addition to the Hindenburg report, Icahn has also incurred a $9 billion loss in recent years on incorrectly predicting the financial markets will crash. He has admitted to learning his lesson on trying to time the markets and has since turned back to shaking up the companies he invests in.Our MethodologyAmid the controversies and the losses, Icahn is still the go-to guy, given his solid stock-picking skills that have allowed him to amass significant wealth by betting on various stocks for decades.

With the purchase, four of his people were appointed to the board.He succeeded in blocking a proposed purchase of a rival oil and gas producer after stating the deal would not benefit shareholders but board members.

It mostly deals in commercial cleaning, maintenance solutions, and closet and garage organization products.

The company would cede to mounting pressure from the billionaire investor agreeing to appoint four people put forward by the investor to the board. Following the agreement, Icahn decided not to increase his stake or launch a proxy fight for an agreed period.With Icahn in firm control, Newell Brands Inc.

The investor sued the company for trying to engineer a privatization deal at the wrong time and price.Icahn, who owned a 9.38% stake, was joined by Czech-based Arca Capital, which held a 2.4% stake in the lawsuit. In the ensuing tussle, the group of investors seeking to take the company private agreed to sweeten the offer to $2.95 billion, which satisfied the opposing parties.Once Amtrust Financial Services, Inc.

On the other hand, Icahn opposed the deal insisting that Cigna was overpaying for a company that faced existential risks.Icahn would fail in his bid to block the $52 billion deal as he faced opposition from proxy advisory firms that supported the agreement, including Glass Lewis and Co and Institutional Shareholders Services. Icahn would exit his stake in the company seven months later for a 13.76% gain and outperforming the S&amp;P 500, up 3.58%.14. Tenneco Inc.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-skyworks-solutions-inc-100714538.html,1692785234,STORY,['SWKS'],"[Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Skyworks Solutions' shares on or after the 28th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 19th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.68 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.72 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Skyworks Solutions has a trailing yield of approximately 2.6% on its current stock price of $105.27. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Skyworks Solutions can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Skyworks Solutions's payout ratio is modest, at just 38% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 28% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Skyworks Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Skyworks Solutions, with earnings per share up 3.6% on average over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past nine years, Skyworks Solutions has increased its dividend at approximately 22% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Skyworks Solutions? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Skyworks Solutions is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Skyworks Solutions is halfway there. Skyworks Solutions looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while Skyworks Solutions has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Skyworks Solutions you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

182,b08123df-5ad0-3fdb-b17e-85ff5bf2548f,NOC,2023-08-23,INSIGHT-How Russia keeps its fleet of Western jets in the air,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-russia-keeps-fleet-western-064004121.html,1692772804,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY', 'NOC']","[By David Gauthier-Villars and Gleb StolyarovDUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A Ural Airlines Airbus landed in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg on Nov. 14 last year. Then it remained grounded on the tarmac.Three days later, a spare part crucial for navigation systems with a declared value of over a quarter of a million dollars, made by U.S. company Northrop Grumman, arrived for the jet, Russian customs records show.A week later, on Nov. 24, the A320 took off for Moscow and has been busy ferrying passengers across Russia and Central Asia ever since, according to flight tracking data.Despite Western sanctions designed to stop Russian carriers from procuring parts for their Airbus and Boeing jets, Ural Airlines has imported over 20 of the U.S.-made devices since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the customs data show.All told, at least $1.2 billion worth of aircraft parts flowed to Russian airlines from May last year - when most U.S. and European trade curbs and export bans over Ukraine were in force - to the end of June this year, a Reuters analysis of the customs records shows.The equipment ranged from essential items needed to keep a jet airworthy - such as the Northrop Grumman devices, cabin pressure valves, cockpit displays and landing gear - to more mundane spares, such as coffee makers, flight attendant telephone handsets and toilet seats.The customs records showed the parts made their way to Russia through middlemen in countries including Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkey, China and Kyrgyzstan – none of which has endorsed Western sanctions on Russia.The $1.2 billion tally underestimates the total value of aircraft parts imported during the period reviewed by Reuters as it only includes shipments destined directly for Russian airlines or their maintenance units - and not plane parts shipped to other companies in Russia.Oleg Panteleev, head of the AviaPort aviation think-tank in Moscow, said Russian airlines have ""solved the problem"" of operating under Western sanctions.Story continues""At first there was a shock, no one knew what to do,"" he told Reuters. ""After two to three months, new supply channels were found and, after six or nine months, quite a lot of alternatives appeared, which allowed for a reduction in prices and delivery times.""'UNNECESSARY INFORMATION'Ural Airlines Deputy Chief Executive Kirill Skuratov declined to comment on how the Russian carrier procured its spare parts. ""I definitely will not tell you that,"" he told Reuters. ""It is unnecessary information.""After reviewing the list compiled by Reuters, Northrop Grumman said it did not identify any sales or repair services by the company to Russian entities. Northrop Grumman said it has ""robust processes and procedures to help ensure compliance with all applicable export and sanctions-related laws and regulations.""The U.S. government said its export controls and those of its allies had severely affected the Russian aviation sector.""We will continue to vigorously enforce our controls by rooting out and disrupting illicit networks, pursuing individuals evading restrictions, and directly engaging with industry and foreign governments to ensure compliance,"" a Department of Commerce spokesperson said.A European Union official said the bloc was closely coordinating with countries that had imposed similar trade curbs to ensure they were not circumvented.""Systems are being put in place in some countries for monitoring, controlling and blocking re-exports,"" the official said.To be sure, Western sanctions have made life more difficult for Russia's aviation sector.In mid 2022, aviation industry sources described how some Russian airlines were stripping some planes for parts. And Russian carrier S7 Airlines said in June last year that it had to scrap plans to launch a low-cost operator because it could not take delivery of the Airbus planes it had ordered.Like its U.S. rival Boeing, the European planemaker cut links with its Russian clients when sanctions kicked in.But as of May 1 this year, Russian carriers had 541 Western planes in active service or under maintenance, according to data compiled by Swiss aviation intelligence provider ch-aviation. That's more or less on a par with before the war, taking into account the 75 planes being leased by Russian airlines that were repossessed by their foreign owners, the ch-aviation data show.Russian airlines carried 10.1 million passengers in June, according to Russia's federal statistics agency Rosstat, compared to 8.87 million in June 2022 and 11.1 million in June 2021.Without Western aircraft, Russian airlines would have had to downsize massively because they only have about 150 Russian-made passenger planes in their fleets, according to ch-aviation data.Russia's trade ministry and civil aviation authority did not respond to messages seeking comment.CIRCUITOUS ROUTEBefore the trade restrictions, Ural Airlines, Aeroflot , S7 and other Russian carriers relied on maintenance support from global firms such as Lufthansa Technik of Germany.When those firms stopped providing services – Lufthansa Technik said it suspended sales to Russia from Feb. 28, 2022 – Russian airlines turned to a pool of far smaller suppliers.In April 2022, for example, S7's maintenance unit, S7 Engineering, began importing parts from a company in Moldova called Air Rock Solutions, according to the customs records.The first shipment was for water filters for Airbus galleys with a declared value of $1,700. Over the next 14 months, S7 received at least $1.23 million of parts from Air Rock, the records show.Ivan Melnicov, chief executive of Air Rock and another aircraft parts distributor in Moldova called Aerostage Services, denied selling products to Russia. He said most of his clients were in the UAE and Kyrgyzstan, among others.""Business with Russian companies is impossible to be done from Moldova, simply considering that their banks are banned in Moldova and payments are not processed,"" Melnicov told Reuters. ""We are not interested in losing our local and international partners for short-term income.""Most of the shipments listed in Russian customs records as having been made by Air Rock and Aerostage took circuitous routes, transiting through the UAE or Kyrgyzstan. Asked if that could indicate his clients in those countries had re-routed deliveries to Russian airlines, the Moldovan businessman did not respond.S7 and Aeroflot did not respond to messages seeking comment.NOSE TO TAIL SERVICESThe serial number listed in Russian customs records for the Northrop Grumman device sent to Yekaterinburg last year shows the part was manufactured in October 2008, and used on different aircraft, including one in Saudi Arabia six year ago, according to an industry source with access to maintenance databases.While the customs records don't name the company that shipped the device in November, they do show how more of the same crucial U.S. parts fitted with high-tech laser gyroscopes reached Urals Airlines during the 14-month period reviewed by Reuters.In July 2022, for example, one was shipped to Ural Airlines via the UAE by Istikloliyat 20, a civil engineering company based in Tajikistan. In September 2022, another Tajik civil engineering firm, Kafolati Komil, also sent one of the parts to Russia via the UAE, the data show.Mahmadbashir Yakubov, chief executive of Istikloliyat 20, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. Reuters was unable to reach Komilchon Yakubov, the chief executive of Kafolati Komil.Some of the shipments of Northrop Grumman parts to Ural Airlines that went through the UAE were handled by a company named Skyparts FZCO, the customs records show.Created in June 2022 and registered in a single-room office in one of Dubai's free economic zones, Skyparts says on its website it was founded by aviation professionals and offers customers ""nose to tail"" support for their aircraft.Asked about the shipments of the Northrop Grumman device, Skyparts manager Saeed Abdulloev told Reuters he was familiar with the part and confirmed that the Dubai firm was doing business with Tajik companies, including Istikloliyat 20.He said Skyparts had procured one of the Northrop Grumman parts from a U.S. supplier but denied ever sending it to Russia. He declined to identify the U.S. firm.HUSBAND AND WIFEOne Russian carrier, Nordwind Airlines, appears to have harnessed family ties to procure parts for the 12 Airbus and 15 Boeing aircraft in its fleet, the customs data show.Owned by Russian entrepreneur Karine Bukrey, according to corporate records, the airline imported hundreds of parts from Ramses Turizm. Based in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, Ramses Turizm is owned by Bukrey's husband, Ramazan Akpinar.Nordwind and Bukrey did not respond to messages seeking comment.Contacted by Reuters on April 4 this year, Akpinar confirmed owning Ramses Turizm and being married to Bukrey. He did not answer questions about aircraft part exports to Nordwind.The Russian records show Nordwind stopped receiving parts from Ramses Turizm three days after Reuters asked about them. However, the airline carried on importing parts from another Turkish company, Na Havacilik ve Teknik, also based in Antalya.Reuters was unable to reach Nusret Alper, who founded Na Havacilik in August 2022, for comment.Nordwind also imported parts via its maintenance unit, NW Technic, according to the customs records. Chief Executive Valery Pashaev told Reuters his unit was solely focused on maintaining aircraft and was not involved in parts procurement.""People bring me parts and tell me where to install them,"" Pashaev said. ""I take the parts and install them.""(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Dubai and Maurice Tamman in New York; Editing by David Clarke and Daniel Flynn)]"

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Pamela Quintiliano, Vice President of Investor Relations. Pamela, you may now begin.Pamela Nagler QuintilianoThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call today are Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO; Tony Spring, President, Macy's Inc., and CEO elect; and Adrian Mitchell, our COO and CFO. Along with our second quarter 2023 press release, a presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website at macysinc.com.Unless otherwise noted, the comparisons discussed today are versus 2022. Comparisons to 2019 are provided where appropriate to best benchmark performance. All references to our prior expectations, outlook or guidance refer to information provided on our June 1 earnings call, unless otherwise noted. All forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today. A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey GennetteGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to begin today's call with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion on the macro environment and how that is informing our approach to the remainder of the year. Tony will then give an update on our 5 growth vectors and the merchandising strategy. From there, Adrian will provide additional detail on the second quarter and our third quarter and full year outlooks. He will also discuss opportunities under his expanded role as COO.Before we dig into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastating wildfires on Maui. We have accounted for all our colleagues on the island, but a few have been directly impacted by the destruction and loss caused by the wildfires. We're supporting those colleagues via our North Star Relief Fund, and are engaged with the American Red Cross through our annual financial commitments and customer roundup campaigns across our Hawaii and Guam stores to support Maui residents. Turning to second quarter results. We achieved net sales of $5.13 billion, a gross margin rate of 38.1% and an SG&amp;A rate of 37.5%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.26 primarily benefited from better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&amp;A. These factors more than offset lower-than-anticipated credit card revenues and a timing shift in the recognition of shortage. Taking a step back, we exited the first quarter with excess spring seasonal receipts at Macy's due to lower-than-anticipated demand trends in the back half of the quarter. On our earnings call, we committed to entering fall in a clean inventory position. Ultimately, we ended the second quarter with inventories down 10% to last year and down 18% to 2019. We were disciplined with our approach to inventory commitments and flex the cadence and depth of promotions and markdowns, utilizing our data-driven tools to reduce the length of seasonal clearance activity by several weeks. Promotional sell-throughs were better than expected and clearance markdowns were not as deep. Thanks to our cross-functional teams for being nimble, flexible and embracing new ways of working. Entering the third quarter, store floors and online are less cluttered and easier to navigate. Content is fresh and seasonally appropriate with open-to-buy and the ability-to-chase into areas of strength, all of which improves the omnichannel shopping experience. At Macy's, net sales declined 9.3% and comparable sales declined 8.2% on an owned plus licensed basis. Aged inventories were roughly 20% below last year's levels and warm weather inventories were about 40% lower. Top-performing categories include beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, women's career sportswear and men's tailored clothing. We also continue to realize improvements in the soft home categories, including textiles and housewares. Active, casual and sleepwear remain challenged. We are working on solutions to improve trends in these categories. In the near term, Active should benefit from the reintroduction of Nike Men's, Women's and Kids online and in 75 doors in October, and the rollout to more than 200 doors this spring. This morning, we are also pleased to announce that Select Under Armour men's product will be available in 150 stores and online beginning in February. The return of Nike and Under Armour speaks to the strength and reach of Macy's and our ability to attract sought after wholesale partners. Looking ahead, we're working with both brands as well as potential new partners on how to expand further. Comparable owned sales for store within stores in our Macy's off-price concept, Backstage, outperformed Macy's full-line stores in which they operate by roughly 260 basis points. At Bloomingdale's, net sales declined 3.6% and comparable sales were down 2.6% on an owned plus license basis. Beauty, women's contemporary and designer apparel and shoes were our best-performing categories, while handbags, men's and dresses were challenged. Bloomingdale's focus remains on being the winning option for multi-branded upscale retail. During the quarter, we introduced HOKA, a leading active shoe brand that is highly relevant to our consumer, and it has been selling out. Bloomingdale's outlet outperformed full line Bloomingdale's locations by about 800 basis points. Later this month, we will be opening our 21st outlet, which will be located in Christiana, Delaware. At Bluemercury, net sales rose 5.6% and comparable sales increased 5.8%. Customers continue to respond well to our skin care and color cosmetic brands. While second quarter results largely exceeded our expectations, they were promotional and markdown driven, which makes it difficult to decipher any potential shifts in consumer health. As we plan the remainder of the year, and we think about 2024, we remain cautious on the pressures impacting our customer, especially at Macy's, where roughly 50% of the identified customers have an average household income of $75,000 or under. Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pulled back on spend in our discretionary categories. They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income, with an ongoing shift to services and experiences. We cannot predict when macro pressures will ease and are focused on controlling what we can control. However, we believe our strong balance sheet, continued disciplined approach to inventories and fortification of fundamentals position us well. Today, we are reading and reacting to shifting consumer preferences in real time. We have remixed category and brand level receipts, pulled back on what's not working and chased into areas of strength. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident in the thoughtful and strategic promotional calendar and offerings we have planned, and our ability to pivot to the right inventory at the right time and right value. We will continue to leverage our data science tools to refine inventory composition, breadth and depth on a weekly basis and a further streamlined decision-making to efficiently find and execute compelling opportunities that had a positive impact, both near and longer term. At Macy's, for back-to-school, we have a compelling mix of relevant national brands, including Jordan Kids, Levi's and Ralph Lauren, and are also offering a better selection of everyday basics, including uniforms. For holiday, we are further amplifying our strength as a gift-giving destination. We have elevated the quality of our products. We have built strong value across our categories from top market to private brands. And beauty and gifting are a more significant piece of our fourth quarter strategy, accounting for over 40% of Macy's brand sales versus mid-30s during the rest of the year. We anticipate a strong holiday for toys, and we will be offering a Disney 100th anniversary collaboration in store and online. This is the start of a longer-term strategic partnership with Disney and Toys ""R"" Us that will have elevated differentiated products across categories brought to life through engaging retail experiences. At Bloomingdale's, this holiday season, we are partnering with many of our luxury brands to introduce high-touch, unique experiences, events and pop-ups curated around the interests and shopping patterns of our best customers. These activations have been designed to create animation and inspiration in our stores and strengthen our client relationships. And at Bluemercury, we have an expanded fragrance offering for holiday, and we will launch our newest proprietary brand, which is focused on body and bath products. We are excited for the back half in all the ways we will serve our customer.Adrian will discuss our full year guidance in detail shortly, but it is important to note that despite elevated headwinds for credit card revenue and asset sales relative to prior outlook, we are reiterating our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Before turning it over to Tony, I want to congratulate our teams on several milestones. At Macy's, we recently introduced our newest private brand, On 34th. Its target demographic is the 30- to 50-year-old woman on the go. Commentary has been very positive, with approximately 80% of product reviews receiving 4 stars or above. At Bloomingdale's, we soft launched Marketplace in July. Customers have been discovering and responding well to the new categories and brands offer. And at Bluemercury, we moved our headquarters from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The team is energized by this important step in its growth trajectory, which places them in one of the major beauty centers of the world, brings cost efficiencies and allows them to further benefit from the existing infrastructure of Macy's, Inc. Looking ahead, we believe that our improving underlying fundamentals, 5 growth vectors and elevated customer experience are key components to relevancy and success as a modern department store. With that, Tony is going to discuss our 5 growth vectors and his approach to merchandising.Antony SpringThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing our teams for their dedication and the innovative work they are leading. I've always believed that valance of tenured and newer colleagues working together brings the most thoughtful and fresh perspectives, and I see that coming to life across the Macy's Inc. organization. Last week, we announced the arrival of Max Magni, our Chief Customer and Digital Officer. Max has over 20 years of experience at McKinsey, most recently as a senior partner, co-leading their next-gen commerce and consumer growth practices. We're excited to have Max join us and look forward to his contributions. Over the last several years, Jeff and Adrian have improved the operational efficiencies and financial health of the company. This has been a key enabler of our transformation and the advancement of our 5 growth vectors. These vectors are intertwined with the overarching strategy of keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our first growth vector is Macy's private brand reimagination. As Jeff mentioned, we recently launched On 34th, which has been informed by direct consumer research. Results are encouraging, with sales exceeding expectations, and we believe On 34th has the potential to become one of our biggest private brands. Our team has been thoughtful in both the development and planned rollout of our updated private brand strategy. Their imagination work has been built on 3 key pillars: first, branch stewardship; second, design with intention and execute with attention; and third, provide a meaningful value equation. From sourcing to marketing to merchandising, the teams have worked together to reflect our customers' wants and needs. They have considered life stages to create product and brands that authentically resonate with and capture the hearts of current and prospective customers. With the reinvigoration of our proprietary portfolio, we expect to further drive customer loyalty by complementing our national brand matrix with differentiated product, which should ultimately benefit sales and gross margin. Through 2025, we would be refreshing or replacing all existing brands in our portfolio and plan to introduce 4 new ones, including On 34th.As part of our updated private brand strategy, last year, we successfully refreshed Women's I.N.C. In the second quarter, momentum for this popular brand continued as sales once again outperformed its broader apparel segment. In September, we'll be introducing the next phase of I.N.C.'s Refresh. Our second growth vector is small store format. We are pleased with the performance of our 10 small-format locations, which include 8 Macy's and 2 Bloomie's. Macy's and Bloomie's stores that have been opened over a year had a positive comparable owned plus licensed sales growth. Last weekend, we opened our 9th small format Macy's just outside Chicagoland area and Indiana. And in September, we'll open 2 more; one will be in Las Vegas and the other will be in Boston, which is our first smaller format in the Northeast. In November, we will open a location in San Diego. Bloomingdale's is also adding to its small format portfolio, with plans to open a third location in November. The store will be located in Seattle, which is a new brick-and-mortar market for the brand. Our third growth vector is digital marketplace, which offers curated categories and brands that seamlessly integrate with the customer experience and have no inventory risk. At Macy's, we're approaching the 1-year anniversary of our marketplace launch. We now offer approximately 1,350 brands on the platform, up from 500 last fiscal year-end, and we grew gross merchandise value by over 116% from the first quarter. At Macy's marketplace, we continue to see significant cross-shopping, higher average order value and higher units per order. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we recently introduced Bloomingdale's marketplace and are pleased with the early results. Our fourth growth vector is luxury, which spans Bloomingdale's, Bluemercury and Macy's Beauty. At Bloomingdale's, we continue to optimize our relationship with our customers and elevate our luxury shopping experience. On a trailing 12-month basis, our top of the list loyalty customer base grew in both count and spend. We know this customer loves the Bloomingdale's shopping experience, and we have remodeled the Bloomingdale's doors with larger concentration of luxury brands and products. Improvements have focused on areas with higher luxury goods penetration, including beauty, fragrances, shoes, handbags and fine jewelry. Thus far, we have remodeled 5 locations and believe there is opportunity for more.At our smallest nameplate, Bluemercury, we realized the tenth consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Active customer count on a trailing 12-month basis rose 20%, driven primarily by new customers. Bluemercury's consistently strong performance is a testament to the work the team is doing to evolve the brand and product mix to stay ahead of trends and offer a more exclusive experience to the luxury skin care and beauty customer. At Macy's Beauty, we're expanding our luxury offering with a net business on newness, freshness in our core market brands and in-store service. As we prepare for the holiday, we will lean into our leading fragrance positioning across our omnichannel shopping experiences, and will introduce 6 additional beauty remodels, bringing the total to 39 locations. Our fifth growth vector is personalized offers and communications. It amplifies strategies across our business to increase customer lifetime value and loyalty by improving relevance of every interaction. Our digital and technology teams are in the early stages of implementing multistep and multichannel tests. We recently launched several new tools that will allow us to speak even more consistently to our customers across touch points, personalized conversations and increase the amount of behaviorally-driven marketing.I am confident that our 5 growth vectors should drive incremental sales growth beginning next year, and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Before turning the call over to Adrian, I want to provide a few thoughts on our overarching merchandise strategy. Over the last several months, I've been spending time with the Macy's team, discussing the right balance of private and market brands and the importance of duration. We're working together to combine their ideas and my experiences at Bloomingdale's. Currently, we are targeting 2 major opportunities. First, going after the right categories, brands and products that excite our customers. And second, maximizing sales and market share opportunity in underpenetrated categories where customers have signaled demand. In addition, we're exploring how we can further establish ourselves as a compelling wholesale partner for current and potential top market brands.The upcoming additions of Nike and Under Armour are 2 great examples. We are a business committed to transforming even in an environment that's unpredictable. Despite the macro conditions and challenges, we remain focused on satisfying our customers' desire to shop off-price to luxury digitally, on-mall or off-mall, and from private brands to up and coming and established national brands. Within that framework, our multichannel, multigenerational and multicategory platform is an advantage to address changing demand. I have confidence in our strategy and the team's ability to execute, which sets us up for success even in this uncertain environment. With that, let me turn it over to Adrian.Adrian V. MitchellThanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I want to start this morning by thanking my finance and real estate teams for their ongoing dedication and hard work, and to my colleagues in stores, technology and supply chain, I am grateful to partner with you more closely. In our last call, I shared the 3 fundamental areas of opportunity that we identified to build a faster, more flexible and more efficient operating model. First, improving the end-to-end omnichannel shopping experience; second, optimizing our physical store footprint while enhancing inventory flow, merchandise planning and localized assortment capabilities; and third, further modernizing our supply chain and technology infrastructure.Over the last few months, I have continued to align with our teams on how to simplify our processes, while providing more consistent shopping experiences that engage and inspire our customers. I look forward to sharing more on this effort in the future.Now let's talk through the second quarter performance for our 5 value creation levers. First, omnichannel sales. Net sales of $5.13 billion declined 8.4% versus the prior year, slightly above the high end of our outlook. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 7.3%. Owned AUR rose 4.7%, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued AUR improvement on ticket increases, lower markdowns and category mix. Other revenue of $150 million were 2.9% of net sales. Macy's Media Network revenue was flat to last year at $30 million. Our long-term confidence in Macy's Media Network is tempered by near-term caution in light of broader industry trends. During the quarter, credit card revenues declined 130 basis points or $84 million year-over-year to $120 million, and represented 2.3% of net sales. We experienced an increased rate of delinquencies within the credit card portfolio across all stages of aged balances. While we had expected delinquencies to rise as part of our normalizing credit environment, the speed at which the increase occurred for us and the broader credit card industry since our first quarter earnings call was faster than planned. This negatively impacted second quarter results and led to an increase in the portfolio's bad debt outlook.As a reminder, credit card revenues for the quarter include the pro rata recognition of the updated annual bad debt assumption. We will discuss our annual outlook inclusive of the updated bad debt assumptions within the credit card portfolio in just a few moments.The second value creation lever is gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 38.1%, 80 basis points below prior year, but above our outlook. Merchandise margin was 130 basis points lower than last year. During the quarter, we leveraged our data-driven processes and tools to maximize margins and sell-throughs of excess spring seasonal receipts. We surgically implemented clearance markdowns and promotions, which, while above last year's levels, were lower than forecasted in our prior outlook.Merchandise margin also impacted by unfavorable category mix shifts and a shift in the timing of shortage recognition, partially offset by better inbound freight charges from our cost savings efforts. In relation to shortage, we added a June physical inventory count in certain categories with low RFID penetration. This helped us better understand shortage trends and informed our outlook and approach to receipt planning for the remainder of the year. The count did not materially change our annual assumption, but it did provide actuals for the categories counted in the second quarter. As a result, we adjusted our shortage accrual shifting a portion of the recognition out of the fourth quarter and into the second and third quarters. Lastly, delivery expense decreased 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to improved carrier rates from contract renegotiations as well as lower fuel costs and lower vendor direct volume. Now let's turn to our third value creation lever, inventory productivity. End of quarter inventory was down 10% year-over-year and down 18% to 2019, which should represent a low point for the fiscal year. Trailing 12-month inventory turnover was roughly flat to last year. Inventory management is a key tenet to further improve the omnichannel customer experience. We're committed to having current and compelling product at the appropriate receipt levels based on expected sales demand.Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A expenses of $1.98 billion were better than our expectations, declining $31 million or 1.5% from prior year. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue was 37.5%, 300 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the decline in year-over-year sales. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.26 versus $1 in 2022. Better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&amp;A were offset by credit card revenues and shortage, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.11 and $0.04, respectively, relative to the midpoint of our prior outlook. Combined, this was roughly a $0.15 impact to EPS. Lastly, the fifth value creation lever, capital allocation. During the first half, we generated $271 million of operating cash flow versus $303 million last year. The change was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by lower merchandise inventories and merchandise accounts payable. We had $564 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow, inclusive of proceeds from real estate was an outflow of $261 million. And year-to-date, we paid $90 million in dividends. Regarding capital deployment in times of uncertainty, liquidity and a healthy balance sheet remain top priorities. They provide us the flexibility to respond to changing consumer and competitive trends, while continuing to invest in our core business and growth vectors. Now let's discuss the full year and third quarter outlook. To level set, we continue to have a cautious view on the consumer. In addition to the headwinds discussed on prior earnings calls, the expiration of student loan forgiveness beginning in October, higher interest rate levels and lower new job creation are all new pressures on the consumer. While we had contemplated these factors when providing an annual outlook on our last earnings call, it is still unknown how consumers will respond to them, especially after so many months of increased pressures. As such, we believe it is prudent to maintain our cautious view on the consumer and their capacity to spend on the discretionary categories we sell. Even with this backdrop, there is much that remains in our control. Entering the third quarter, inventories are clean, current and fresh, with an improved fashion and seasonless composition at compelling values that we believe appropriately reflects demand. Quarter-to-date sales results are in line with our expectations on reduced year-over-year promotions and clearance activity.Now that I've provided the framework on how we are thinking about the back half, let's walk through our updated full year expectations. Our full year outlook now contemplates reduced credit card revenues and asset sale gains, both of which are fully offset by better-than-expected second quarter results and favorable changes in interest expense and share count. Our outlook continues to include approximately $200 million of cost savings discussed on our last earnings call. For fiscal 2023, we now assume net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned plus licensed basis to be down about 7.5% to down 6% to last year. As a reminder, compares ease in the third and fourth quarters. Other revenue to be about 3.2% of net sales, with credit card revenues accounting for roughly 80% to 81% of that. The increased bad debt expectation for the credit card portfolio has resulted in a reduction in our annual forecast of roughly $80 million relative to our prior expectations. Given the magnitude of the credit card revenue impact, I want to take a moment to provide additional color. Credit card revenues are predominantly driven by the level and health of sales and receivables generated from our proprietary and co-brand credit cards. While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs. These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio. We are working closely with our bank partner, Citibank, to mitigate the rising bad debt by adjusting underwriting strategies. We also remain focused on acquiring new customers and retaining our active customer base as we communicate future personalized value to our customers. But we are not assuming any benefit in the near term.Additionally, potential regulatory changes regarding late fees are still pending. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. Returning to the remaining line items. We are anticipating a gross margin rate of 38.3% to 38.6%, which is slightly better than our prior expectations of 38% to 38.5%. Our assumption for shortage, which impacts gross margin, remains materially unchanged. Shortage continues to be a headwind, and we are focused on a variety of mitigation strategies, including testing the use of advanced technology, reporting and tools, moving high-step product away from entrances in our stores, optimizing asset protection staffing to target high-risk areas and collaborating with external parties to advocate for legislative change. Now let's turn to SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be 35.6% to 35.2%, or 36.7% to 36.4% as a percent of net sales, reflecting ongoing expense discipline efforts with additional risk on the low end given the importance of protecting the customer experience. Asset sale gains are now expected to be approximately $50 million, with nearly all the remaining gains anticipated in the fourth quarter. While the real estate market has become more challenging in light of higher interest rates, there is no change to our asset monetization strategies.We are confident in the value of our assets, have seen these cycles before, and we'll be patient to ensure we receive the appropriate valuations for our properties. Fortunately, we have the balance sheet to do so. We expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.7% to 9.4%, or 9% to 9.7% as a percent of net sales. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $160 million. After interest and taxes, we are maintaining our annual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 to $3.20, which reflects an updated annual diluted shares expectation of roughly 279 million shares.There are lots of moving parts to our annual EPS outlook. To summarize, relative to our prior expectation, gross margin, SG&amp;A and shares are the primary benefits. When looking at the low and high end of our current outlook compared to what we discussed on our first quarter call, gross margin, inclusive of volume and mix, is positively contributing an incremental $0.14 to the low end and $0.06 to the high end of our prior outlook. SG&amp;A is contributing an incremental $0.06 to $0.19. And together, lower share count and interest expense are contributing an incremental $0.04 These factors reflect solid execution in our core business and represents a $0.24 to $0.29 benefit relative to our prior outlook. On the flip side, reduced credit card revenues are a $0.21 to $0.22 drag on the low end and high end of our prior outlook, while lower asset sale gains are a $0.03 to $0.07 negative impact. Combined, this also represents $0.24 to $0.29, essentially canceling each other out. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance does not assume potential share repurchases. For the third quarter, we expect net sales of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion, gross margin rate to be at least 140 basis points better than the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder, last year, Macy's had elevated promotions and markdowns to clear excess receipts in warm weather seasonal goods and slower moving pandemic-related categories, including casual apparel and soft home. Adjusted diluted EPS down $0.03 to up $0.02, inclusive of our updated credit card revenues outlook and the timing shift in the recognition of shortage. End of quarter inventories to be down low to mid-single digits to last year on a percentage basis as we begin to introduce Nike and further support On 34th and I.N.C. private brands. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving low single-digit sales growth beginning next year and believe that improved underlying fundamentals and the early contributions of our 5 growth vectors will provide an offset to ongoing macro pressures impacting our consumer. However, we do have additional external factors that are more difficult to combat. If recent trends in credit card revenues, shortage and asset sale gains continue, and late fee regulatory changes are passed, the ability to achieve low double-digit EBITDA margin in '24 becomes more challenging. Now to be clear, there have been no changes to the underlying assumptions and opportunities regarding the rest of our business. We're actively working to offset headwinds, prioritize growth, and we'll share more as the year progresses. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.Jeffrey GennetteThank you, Adrian and Tony. It has been exciting to watch you two collaborate to find innovative ways of opportunity that reflects your unique lenses and backgrounds. And I am confident that you will lead Macy's, Inc. to sustainable long-term profitable growth. Now operator, we will now open it up for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver Chen2Q revenue and margins were encouragingly better. What was the driver behind that? And as we look at 3Q guidance being below Street, I assume it's primarily the credit card delinquency bad debt expense. AURs were also encouragingly up. What was the offset to that? We assume it could have been traffic. And a follow-up, as you think about longer term, the small format opportunity, how are you dimensionalizing the addressable market there?Adrian V. MitchellAll right. So, Oliver, good morning. It's great to be with you. So look, despite the timing shift that we recognized with shortage, we achieved the gross margin rate in the second quarter ahead of our expectation. So we were actually quite pleased with that. Now while the second quarter was more promotional than last year, as we worked to clear a lot of the seasonal product that we talked about, it was less promotional than we had anticipated. We leaned into a lot of our strategic and personalized promotions, leaned into our pricing science as we've talked about prior. But look, leveraging the data-driven processes that we've had in place and been using for the last couple of years, allowed us to really maximize our margins in sell-throughs as we actually exited the spring season. Now as we did in previous seasons, we're actually able to clear through a lot of the seasonal product that we've spoken about several weeks ahead of schedule. So we're continuing to take these behaviors into the back half of the year.Jeffrey GennetteThe other thing I'd add on that, Oliver, would be just our inventory is in a great position. So exiting the third quarter, down 10%, we have been able to retain a lot of liquidity that will respond to customer interest. But our stock-to-sales ratios are good by category. The third quarter has started at expectation. We're looking at the back-to-school read as well as really all new fall fashion and how that's performing. And we have confidence as we go into the fourth quarter on our strategies.Adrian V. MitchellIf I could just answer your last question, Oliver, with regards to small format stores, we're very excited about the growing impact of our small format stores. As you know, we remain in the early stages of continuing to scale this opportunity, but we did announce that we're opening up a number of stores this fall. Chicagoland, Boston, Las Vegas, San Diego are several locations where we'll be opening up our small format Macy's stores. And in the Seattle market, we'll be opening up a small format Bloomingdale's. Last week, we did open up a store in Chicagoland. But as we think about the quality of experience for our customers, we continue to see positive signals in terms of the financial performance and the customer experience within these stores. So we're actively evaluating potential locations across the country that will enable us to accelerate growth at the appropriate time. So more to come on this topic.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Tony, could you just elaborate on the key strategic initiatives that you believe best positions Macy's for a return to revenue growth next year? And then Adrian, any notable differences in top line by income cohort that you're seeing today, maybe relative to 3 months ago? Any change in macro that you're embedding for the back half of the year? And then just given the potential external changes that you mentioned, how best to think about a range of EBITDA margin outcomes for next year relative to the low double-digit target that you've laid out?Antony SpringThanks for the question, Matt. Let me begin with the opportunities for growth. Just as a reminder, I've been part of the Macy's executive leadership team for the last few years and working closely with Adrian and Jeff and other senior leaders the last few months. And I remain bullish on the opportunities for the entire portfolio. And remember, Macy's, Inc. is a portfolio company with obviously power in the Macy's brand, Bloomingdale's brand and Bluemercury brands. I believe that our opportunity remains in going off-price to luxury, multi-brand, multi-category. And these 5 growth vectors are designed to help us to amplify our business. They are designed around merchandise, which includes private brand and making sure that we are bringing the most important market brands to all of our portfolio. The reintroduction of Nike and the announcement of Under Armour is a good example of that. It's strengthening our marketing, but on a more personalized basis with specific offers that are right for that customer, at the level of modernization in our marketing. It's also making sure that our portfolio has the right number of stores in the right locations that include the quality malls that we're in today as well as, as Adrian described, the right small-format locations that densify, replace existing stores that may not be as productive, or allow us to enter new markets. The luxury business is a piece of the puzzle that we feel very strongly about. It underscores the importance of Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, but also gives us the opportunity to expand the Macy's Beauty business. And as we mentioned, beauty is a category that's grown across every single nameplate. So we feel strongly about all of our growth vectors. But in answering fully your question, I think the growth opportunity for the Macy's brand requires us to dig deeper into the assortments and making sure that we eliminate redundancy and we improve variety, making sure that people find the brands they're looking for as well as the level of exclusivity that comes from our private brand assortment. And the final piece I would say is the team is highly focused on improving the customer experience, physically and digitally, doing those things that are necessary to create a more seamless and easier omnichannel experience.Adrian V. MitchellMatt, just going through a few points that you raised. The first is we have a discerning customer across all income tiers. They're being quite choiceful about how they think about experiences versus discretionary goods. And so we continue to be thoughtful about focusing on the things that we can control to deliver a positive experience for our customers. The reality is, in the macro environment, we continue to remain cautious as we spoke about earlier in our opening remarks. We do believe that there continues to be pressure within the macro environment, so we will continue to remain cautious. To your third dimension around EBITDA margins, as we think about next year, the first thing that we would emphasize is what Tony spoke to, which is our top priority, is profitable growth. And that profitable growth is about low single-digit growth beginning next year, and we remain confident in that. The kinds of things that we're controlling is our balance sheet. The operating disciplines that you've seen from us around inventory management and expense management, the quality of execution on our fundamentals within our core business, and we continue to see that our 5 growth vectors remain on track. Now as it relates to low double-digit EBITDA, it remains our aspiration longer term. Now as we look on the horizon in the near term, we see several factors worsening and difficult to offset, again in the near term. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, credit card revenues, shortage and asset gains are all the type of things that are at the top of our list. So look, as we think about credit card revenues, we've experienced higher aged balances across all delinquency levels, which has lead to increased bad debt impact in our credit card. And as you know, there's still an open question about the legislative ruling on limiting late fees, which is something that we'll have to quantify the potential impacts of if that ruling comes to fruition. Shortage, as you know, has been an industry-wide opportunity. It has been at elevated levels for multiple years. Shortage for us for the second year in a row will be at record levels. Now, we continue to put mitigation strategies in place to address that, but these mitigation strategies will likely take time to effectuate. And then obviously, with regards to real estate, the industry is really challenged right now with higher interest rates, higher cap rates and higher hurdle rates. We do have confidence in our real estate, but we will be patient on our ability to monetize those assets. So when you look at the confluence of all these different factors, our ability to achieve low double-digit EBITDA in the near term may be more challenging. But as we progress through the year and we focus on our expense management initiatives and the growth initiatives that Tony referenced, we'll share more in the near future.OperatorThe next question is coming from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachAdrian, I was hoping you could help us understand the potential levers that you have for additional improvement in margin rate should the consumer dynamic backdrop worsen into the back half of the year? How are you thinking about merchandise margins and promotional backdrops? And what are the incremental opportunities in SG&amp;A expense beyond what you've already identified?Adrian V. MitchellAbsolutely. Thanks very much for raising the question, Brooke. As we think about gross margin, the disciplines that you've seen from us are pretty key. And that's really around strong execution on the customer experience and healthy inventory management. Now we've talked a lot about inventory management from the perspective of the volume of inventory which allows us to limit our markdowns, the composition of inventory that allows us to support full price sell-through as well as the freshness of inventory to have the relevant content for our customers to shop from us versus the competition. We'll continue to be very thoughtful about executing on those, but you've seen us pretty consistently execute on the gross margin side over time. The one thing I would call out as we think about gross margin for the balance of the year is we've done something a little bit different this year with shortage. So this year, we actually had a midyear shortage -- midyear inventory count, which gave us greater confidence and visibility into shortage trends for the year. So we did recognize some shortage in Q2. We will recognize some shortage in Q3 and Q4, which is different from what we've done in prior years, which is to recognize it all in the fourth quarter. So we are very thoughtful about how we're thinking about the margin rate going through the balance of the year. We're excited about the composition of inventory. We're excited about all the initiatives that Jeff and Tony spoke to, but we also are cautious in terms of making sure that we have the capacity to respond to growth opportunities and to absorb any potential promotions that we may need to do to move through the business in the fall season.As it relates to SG&amp;A, we continue to feel good about the $200 million that we spoke about in cost savings earlier in the year. We spoke about it in our June 1 call. We've been working on it for a number of months. We're seeing those come through, and a larger portion of those benefits, both on the SG&amp;A expense and the gross margin expense, is expected to materialize in the back course of the year, with the biggest being in the fourth quarter. But we continue to be very focused on expense discipline, and that's something that you'll continue to see us focus on for quite some time.OperatorThe next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck.Greg SommerI just wanted to dig into the health of the consumer a little more, looking at the outperformance of Bloomie's outlet and then also Backstage and then also higher credit card delinquencies, it would suggest that the health of the consumer has deteriorated and even at the high end. I was just curious, is this accurate? I just wanted to get more color on the health of the consumer by what you're seeing in terms of performance by store vendor or what you're seeing when you dig into the credit card data?Adrian V. MitchellSo why don't I start with the credit card data, and then we'll talk a little bit about the consumer a bit more broadly. So with regards to the credit card data, the one thing I would say is that we're managing our credit card revenues to the best extent we can. And I think the credit card revenue is an indication of some of the pressures that we're actually seeing on the consumer. So as you know, we have actually planned out higher delinquencies based on the expectation of a normalizing credit environment. But what we did see is that the speed of those delinquencies across all age balances or age balances actually accelerated after Q1, and that occurred primarily in June and July. So we've made a number of adjustments there. Now what's interesting about this is that there are things that we can control and things that we cannot control. The things that we're controlling is that we're working actively to mitigate a lot of the headwinds that we see. So for example, we're working with our credit card partner, Citibank, to target higher risk segments to surgically reduce exposure. We're also maintaining spend in places where we can for customers that have the capacity. We're acquiring new customers. We're retaining active customers, and we're focusing on the spend on their At Macy's on their prop card. But there are things that we cannot control, which I think gets very much into what you're describing around the health of the consumer, and that's the macro environment. So the macro environment really is having the lion's share of the impact on credit and is a real indicator of where we think the health of the consumer is and supporting our cautious approach. The one metric we find quite interesting is the debt service ratio, which we leverage as a proxy for the consumer's ability to pay debt using their disposable income -- personal income. So this is about credit card balances, this is about student loans which we know is going to come into focus in the next month or two, auto loans, mortgage. So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.Jeffrey GennetteChuck, what I'd add is your question about off-price. So just know that when we've always been quoting what's going on with our off-price business between Bloomingdale's and Macy's, you heard that off-price at Macy's outperformed the balance by almost 300 basis points at outlet Bloomingdale's versus the Bloomingdale's brand was about an 800-point difference. That really is just our -- when you think about being, in most cases, mall base to have an off-price option has been a potent part of our discovery with price. And so what we have seen over time is that there is no cannibalization that's going on between the full price and the off-price side. It's just building stickier relationships with customers. They're building up their spend with us. They're shopping more frequently. We certainly saw that in the second quarter. And then to your question about kind of how different income levels has been affected, we'll talk about the Macy's brand. Certainly, the Macy's brand is more under pressure, and it really is the stat of that 50% of the Macy's customers are making $75,000 or less. So they've been under pressure. I think there are some headwinds coming, particularly with student loan, that expiration of the loan forgiveness. And what we're really looking to do is controlling what we can control and ensuring that we've got the right stock to sales ratio in all of our categories, and that we've got receipt reserve to chase into demand. So we feel good about our fourth quarter strategy, and we feel good about where our inventories are right now with this consumer.OperatorThe next question is coming from Blake Anderson of Jefferies.Blake AndersonI was wondering if you could talk a little -- or give a little bit more color on the monthly trends you're seeing and maybe back-to-school and then just higher level. Talk about your confidence in the comp guide and kind of reiterating the comp guide for the rest of the year? I know you've talked about some pressures on the consumer, but you're being conservative. Just give a little bit more commentary on your decision to reiterate the previous comp guide for the year? And then second question was, on the promotional environment, wondering if you can talk about your expectations for the holiday in terms of promotions? And then how you're planning inventory for the holiday?Jeffrey GennetteOkay. Blake, so first off, let's just talk about the second quarter. So we're not disclosing our monthly performance. But as we talked about on the first quarter call, we did expect the second quarter to be promotional based on the spring seasonal inventory overhang. And we successfully liquidated any sort of liability that we had coming into the third quarter. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in looking at that trend since that is more clearance driven than what we are planning and experiencing right now in the third quarter. Third quarter started at our expectation, really a mix between our back-to-school performance as well as new fall fashion. And just to kind of reiterate, having those fundamentals in place of the stock-to-sales ratio, being in stock on all the most important items, having discipline with our pricing science and getting great traction on that, having inventory be as healthy as it is with a strong balance sheet and then really green shoots in our 4 growth factors is really kind of the stake that we're walking into the fall season with. So as we talk about the fourth quarter, we have confidence in our strategies. So the trending businesses like beauty and some of the gifting businesses, are a higher penetration of the fourth quarter business than it is the other 3 quarters. We should draft off of that. When you look at the amount of newness that we have in gifting, so high quality, great value, and that great value is built into our gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter. So we're going to be sharpen on our values. We're going to be competitive. As we've seen over the past couple of years, the customer is shopping earlier and they're shopping all the way through Black Friday, Cyber Monday, taking the lull last 10 days, we're ready for all that. We've built the promotional calendar so that we thought through all of where the customer where we expect them to shop in each of our brands. I think specifically, when you look at the fourth quarter, in addition to the gifting strategies and the penetration of trending businesses, it's also the add of Nike, it's the Toys ""R"" Us and the Disney collaboration. Very importantly, just the liquidity to be able to respond to inventory that's always in the system and this agile team that is responding in real time faster than ever. So that's what -- is what is built into our guide when we think about the back half of the year and the status of what we are -- where we're at going into it.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about the bad debt expense and credit cards, have you looked at it versus 2008, what could be similar and what's different in the trajectory? And then as you think about this current second quarter, how did -- what was the cadence of the quarter? How did you exit? I know, Jeff, you mentioned just about third quarter and back-to-school. Anything on tourism that we should note? And then Tony, just on other brands. It's nice to see Nike and Under Armour. Are there other categories that you want to enhance the brand assortments that we should be looking to?Adrian V. MitchellI'll start with regards to your question around credit card, and then I'll have Jeff and Tony speak to the quarter cadence. So look, we've looked at our credit card revenues and bad debt levels as far back is 2005 in our recent conversations. So we have a good understanding of the puts and takes. We recognize that there have been evolutions in terms of our agreement with Citibank. But from our perspective, it's continuing to control the controllables and continuing to navigate beyond controllables, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. Again, as I shared, so much of this is really around the health of the consumer, and so much is also around what we consider to be the debt service ratio. As you think about the average household income in the U.S., if you think about the average household income of our customers, particularly in the Macy's brand, that consumer is experiencing a number of headwinds as they think about servicing their responsibilities and their liabilities. I referenced it a little bit earlier credit cards. I referenced student loans, auto loans, mortgage, all those in a higher interest rate environment creates real challenges. Now coming into the year, we did project bad debt levels to normalize, but they just normalized a little bit faster than expected. But as we continue to look at ways to mitigate by giving more personalized offers to customers, as well as increased usage on our proprietary credit card, acquiring new customers and really leaning into the loyalty aspects, we're working very diligently to find the best offsets we can.Jeffrey GennetteDana, I'm going to -- I'll take on the cadence by month and the tourism, and I'll hand it over to Tony on new brands and new categories. On the -- as I mentioned in my conversation earlier, to the question from Blake, we're not disclosing our monthly performance and that it was heavily marked down and promotional driven. So that is on the second quarter. As it relates to tourism, this is one that we still have not seen the return of the depth of the international tourists that we typically have at Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So just to remind our international tourism is generally 3% to 4%. That's what it was in prepandemic sales. It's now south of 2% of our overall business. So that tailwind is coming in the future. We're not predicting yet when that's going to be, but know that when you look at the second quarter tourism business versus the first quarter, it was pretty similar. It was pretty comparable from where we are versus the 2019 level. I'll turn it over to Tony.Antony SpringThanks, Dana. I think the introduction of Nike is just a good example of what's possible as we go forward. It's an important brand, the #1 brand in the active category. And I think we obviously have built into our expectations the opportunity in Nike. The other benefit you have is people who come to Macy's for Nike don't just buy Nike, they're going to buy other things. So I'll tell you what I shared with the team last week as they took me through the spring merchandise assortments. First, I was excited to hear the level of newness and discovery and the interest in variety and the desire to bring more interest to our assortments. And I think that, that level of curiosity, that level of newness is an important ingredient in our success going forward. I think the other thing that's important is looking at these categories that are adjacent. So we have marketplace, which allows us to test quickly, introduce brands and ideas that we haven't had at Macy's or Bloomingdale's before. And then we can move quickly, whether we add those things to our stores or whether we keep them just as a part of the marketplace. But I think the team is very focused on bringing more newness and more interest and more excitement to our assortments.OperatorThe next question is coming from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulAnd Tony, great to talk with you. Best of luck with this undertaking. 2 questions for you. I guess the first one is, when you think about sort of the trend of digital versus the in-store, how are you thinking about that for the back half of the year? And then on the digital marketplace, is the sort of the ramp on the brands on the platform, especially at Macy's, is that where you want it to be? Or will you be adding more brands sort of into holiday and into next year?Antony SpringThanks, Bob. I think we are excited about the growth of the brand assortment on Macy's marketplace, and as we mentioned, the early read on Bloomingdale's marketplace. We have Max Magni who we mentioned, who joins us after a distinguished the 20-plus year career at McKinsey, focused on the digital business, and he will be very helpful, I think, to accelerating our performance in the digital space as well as in our overall marketplace business. I also want to just remind everyone that Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury are omnichannel businesses. And while we will always have these accelerations and movements based on cycles between the channels, our focus is making sure that we satisfy the customer no matter where they choose to shop. So that's a part of our small format expansion because customers are going off mall. It's a part of renovating in beauty at Macy's and on main floor Bloomingdale's, our most important mall doors because that's where people go to shop. It's a part of our investment into new experiences online because we want to make sure that we are both a place of transaction as well as a place of experience on Macy's bloomingdales.com and bluemercury.com. So we really do manage between the channels, but we ultimately are focused on satisfying the customer.Robert Scott DrbulGot it. And the other question I have is just on delivery expense, I think it was down this quarter. But I guess, how are you planning that for the remainder of the year?Adrian V. MitchellWell, delivery expense has been a part of some of the cost savings initiatives that we've thought about, which impacts the combination of the placement of our goods within our system, and also how we think about the processing of our delivery. So look, it continues to be an opportunity for us. We continue to benefit from some of the renegotiated terms with regards to our carrier expenses. We're continuing to look at opportunities to truly optimize how we think about owned versus media versus marketplace, which not only improves our expense profile, but also improves our margin profile. And so there's just a number of ongoing efforts that we have as it relates to inventory and as it relates to delivery expense.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCan you remind us what percent of your sales are done on credit? How that looks versus last year? And you also mentioned mitigating exposure to higher-risk customers. What percent of your credit card portfolio is made up of those customers? And do those mitigation efforts not have an immediate effect? You didn't reduce any second half sales guidance, I don't think at all. And I'm curious how long it might take those efforts to have an impact potentially on the top line that you would incorporate into your guidance?Adrian V. MitchellAbsolutely, Paul. Great to be with you. So on your first question, in recent history, we've typically been at around 2.9% to 3% of net sales. But if you look further back in history, it's actually been lower than that. So the question that was raised earlier about looking at our credit card revenues as a percent of net sales, we've looked at it as far back as 2005, and understanding the puts and takes that actually impact that performance. As it relates to the health of our credit card portfolio, we have a healthy portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we look at a number of factors beyond FICO scores to understand the health of the consumer, their capacity to spend, make thoughtful decisions about their line of credit, who we approve on the card versus not. So we do have a healthy portfolio. We look at our return on assets, and we'll continue to do that. I think the reality of what we've seen in the credit card shift is really around the pressure on the consumer. And again, that's the lion's share of the impact that does impact our credit card revenues. But look, we've seen these cycles before. We've been through these cycles before, and we will continue to work to find mitigation strategies within the context that we're given to increase credit card revenues to the appropriate levels, leveraging our personalized capabilities, continuing to expand our customer base across all nameplates. So it's just another dimension of our business that we have to manage actively as we go forward.Paul Lawrence LejuezAdrian, what percent of your sales are done on credit, the proprietary credit card?Adrian V. MitchellSo within our loyalty program, they're about 70%. I think about 72% of sales are done across our loyalty program, but our bronze tier is a nontender tier. So when you look at our gold, silver and platinum, our penetration rate today is about [43%].Paul Lawrence LejuezGot it. And what percent of the higher risk customers that you mentioned?Adrian V. MitchellLook, Paul, we have a healthy portfolio. We're not deep into subprime, if that's the nature of your question. We are not approving high-risk customers. We want to have healthy customers using our card for a longer period of time. And so we do not lean aggressively into subprime.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonJust 2 for me. The first is just on SG&amp;A. I wanted to dig in there a little bit more. It seems like the guidance contemplates higher SG&amp;A than prior, but I know you reiterated the $200 million in savings that you've identified. So can you just hash out further what's changed there, seemingly worsened versus 3 months ago? And then secondly, strength in select categories like beauty, are you all mixing further into those categories as a result? Or how nimble can you be as you see strength or weakness in certain categories?Adrian V. MitchellAll right. So thanks so much for the question, Alexandra. Let me start with SG&amp;A, and then I'll hand it over to Tony and Jeff. So look, our outlook includes a portion of the $200 million in annual cost savings that we identified and spoke to on the June 1 call. We spoke to the fact that 70% of that is SG&amp;A related to simplifying a lot of our processes and driving efficiencies across the business. The remaining 30% is really around things like delivery expense and inbound freight that was raised earlier in the conversation. Now as we demonstrated in the second quarter, SG&amp;A was better than our expectations due to these disciplines and these initiatives that I've referenced. And we continue to be very focused on expense management. We think there's lots of opportunities. And especially in this environment with so much volatility that we're responding to, we're very focused on expense management and discipline as best as we can. As we think about the back half of the year, we'll continue to be focused on expense management. But what's really important as well is making sure we have the appropriate level of investment in the customer experience. Our biggest quarter is ahead of us, which is the fourth quarter. That's where we tend to win as a gifting destination. And so we want to make sure that the customer has options, that we don't compromise the shopping experience and we take advantage of the biggest opportunity we can to have a solid year.Jeffrey GennetteAnd then, Alex, let me talk about the second part of your question. We -- based on the liquidity that we have always built in, and that's a new discipline that we've had over the past 1.5 years, we always have receipts that can chase into signals that are positive. And just as rigorous as what we do on a weekly basis is cutting back on signals that we expected that didn't materialize. So the opportunity to always be going where the customer is, this has not been an issue of not having brands or inventory available in the system to react to. So this is -- we've obviously, as we've discussed in the past, have changed our relationship with our key vendors, really buying more to net cost, not buying into markdown allowances, giving us full flexibility to respond to the customer in the moment. So we have confidence that to your question about beauty, we can chase into beauty. We have obviously built very aggressive strategies for the fall season based on our trends and our merchandising teams and the strength of those brands and where our customer expects us to be. So some we plan and some are going to react to and chase into.Antony SpringAnd Alex, let me add that we have strength and beauty across Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So that's digitally and physically on-mall and off-mall. And fragrance is an important category for us and trending well in all 3 nameplates. So we're bullish in the business for the fall.OperatorThe next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI wanted to focus for a minute on your cost savings program. You have spoken about a $300 million to $350 million run rate of savings in fiscal '24, but it seems that you're outperforming that early. How much of these things are included in the 2023 guidance versus how much will be incremental in 2024?Adrian V. MitchellThank you for your question. It's a good question, Lorraine. So as we referenced, the $200 million this year is a combination of both gross margin and SG&amp;A expense. What we spoke to on the last call was that there is an annualized benefit of about $300 million to $350 million. Now the reality is that we're continuing to benefit from those opportunities and those initiatives this year. So we're pretty excited about what we're seeing here. The key thing I would say is that the initiatives are real. And as an organization, we're continuing to lead into these expense opportunities. We have not given specifics on how this will materialize as we get into next year. We're still working through kind of how we think about our growth profile and margin profile for next year. But we'll definitely keep you posted and give you much greater clarity on those puts and takes as we get into 2024.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAnd then I just wanted to follow up on credit. It sounds like the second quarter numbers included pro rata recognition for the updated annual debt outlook. But it looks like you're guiding second half down to a similar decline. Can you talk about the dynamics of this revenue stream going forward?Adrian V. MitchellYes, absolutely. So the leading indicator on bad bet write-offs are the delinquency rates. So we look at it at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 30-day increments all the way up to 180 days, which is when the write-off actually happens. So from our perspective, as we think about past purchases, and we see the level of delinquencies that has been increasing across all age band balances, we're actually projecting what we believe to be the bad debt levels given the trends that we see. So given those leading indicators and what we see with other factors in and around the consumer that gives us a perspective and a greater level of confidence around what we believe our credit card revenues will be based on our bad debt levels.OperatorOur last question for today will be coming from Jay Sole of UBS.Jay Daniel SoleJust 2 questions for me. One, on the delinquency rate that you cited for June, July. Was the delinquency rate higher in July than what you saw in June? Was June the peak and then it slowed in July? And then secondly, just on the small stores, can you just elaborate a little bit on the proof points that you're seeing that give you confidence to open up more small stores? And how many small stores you see the company opening up over the next, say, 6 to 12 to 18 months?Adrian V. MitchellThanks so much for your question. So on delinquencies, the thing to keep in mind is that we did plan for higher delinquencies this year. We have spoken a number of times over the last 18 months about the credit environment really normalizing. But this was the first time in the second quarter where we actually saw that our projections were more conservative than the actuals. So what we've done with the acceleration, particularly that we saw in June and July that we've adjusted our trajectory per Lorraine's question that I spoke to a few moments ago. But effectively, what we've been doing is looking at that on a regular basis and making the appropriate adjustments for the trajectory of the return to a more normalized environment. As we think about small format stores, there are kind of 3 key things that we think about. The first is the quality of the customer experience. And as we look at a number of factors, including the availability of product, the quality of the experience, the quality of service, all these different factors what we're seeing are very healthy numbers as we think about the performance of these stores and the quality of the experience for the customer. The second thing that we look at is the financial trends of the business. And so for stores that are comped, we're seeing healthy year-over-year growth in this portfolio, and we're getting better. We see lots of opportunity around product, around how we engage customers in the local market. But even in spite of our learning experience, we continue to see growth in stores that are actually comping. The third thing that we're excited about is the potential that's ahead. And so when we think about where customers are, where we can invest, we see a portfolio of healthy big box stores where we will continue to invest, complemented by a large number of small format stores. We do believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate over the next several months in the timeframe that you described, but we'll be able to share more specifics on that, hopefully in the coming months and quarters.Antony SpringYes. And, Jay, I would add that we're excited in the Macy's small format that we now have Polo and Levi's and Finish Line in Sunglass Hut and now Nike added to those stores. And as Adrian mentioned, looking very carefully at the traffic, conversion and a whole host of other metrics to make sure that we are seeing the proof points necessary to expand the portfolio of small doors.OperatorAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gennette for closing comments.Jeffrey GennetteSo thanks, operator, and for all of you who's still on the call, I hope that you enjoy the last days of summer, and we look forward to updating you on our results on the third quarter on our November call. Thanks, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in Macy's. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"
188,617b1ff8-d83f-3d92-b4a5-1fff7fd97e5e,NKE,2023-08-23,12 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-undervalued-blue-chip-214656405.html,1692740816,STORY,"['^DJI', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'DIS', 'CVX', 'MRK', 'AXP', 'V', 'NKE', 'MSFT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. If you want to see which blue chip stocks haven't done well this year, then you can check out 15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. Some top stock picks in the list of undervalued blue chip stocks favored by hedge funds are Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).12 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we ranked blue chip stocks by their share price upside in percentage based on analyst average share price targets. Then, the number of hedge fund investors in the top 20 companies was determined for the funds' second quarter of 2023 investment portfolio, and the top 12 stocks are listed below.12 Most Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2023: 70Share Price Upside: 20%The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the largest investment banks in the world. It is currently restructuring its business operations by considering a divestment of its investment advisory service business and limiting its services to high net worth and wealthy individuals.By the end of this year's second quarter, 70 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). Out of these, the firm's largest shareholder is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management since it owns 5.1 million shares that are worth $1.6 billion.Along with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc.

It also revised outlooks for River City Bank and S&amp;T Bank (STBA) to negative while maintaining a negative outlook for Zions Bancorporation (ZION).Those stocks fell in Tuesday trading. The KBW Nasdaq regional bank index (^KRX) dropped 4% so far this week and is poised for its weakest month since turmoil roiled the entire industry in March.The downgrades from S&amp;P Global announced on Monday night came two weeks after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded 10 mid-sized institutions by a single notch, warned about a review of six additional lenders, and assigned a negative outlook to 11 others.A Fitch Ratings analyst has also warned that the entire industry could be downgraded to A+ from AA-, which could trigger cuts for some of the country's largest banks and sweeping downward adjustments for smaller rivals.The pressure on the industry comes from the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign to cool inflation with higher interest rates, which has in turn lowered the value of bonds held by many institutions and forced many institutions to pay more to attract or keep deposits.Read more: What the Fed rate hike means for bank accountsThat, in turn, has lowered profits and heightened the risk of liquidity problems.

And if the value of the Treasury bonds they own as investments continues to fall, that will put pressure on balance sheets by increasing unrealized losses.All of this has the potential to create a ""doom loop"" for some regional banks, NewEdge Wealth senior portfolio manager Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance earlier this month.""If Treasury yields go up and the value of Treasuries declines, it pressures the stock price of regional banks, who then have to sell those Treasury bonds to make up for those losses and also build up reserves,"" he said. ""And that can further affect their stock price.""Despite S&amp;P’s expectation for profitability to ""likely worsen further in 2024,"" the agency said the outlook for most US banks remains stable thanks in part to an emergency bank funding program initiated by US regulators and the ""greater-than-anticipated resilience"" of the US economy.But profitability for the select banks is ""likely to continue declining as long as the Federal Reserve is quantitatively tightening,"" the ratings agency added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

However, declining revenues, lower loan balances and concerns about mortgage banking income make us apprehensive.Through measures like streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount undertaken from the third quarter of 2020, WFC has managed its expenses prudently, aiding its financials. Notably, for the three years ended 2022, its expenses witnessed a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.5%. The declining trend continued in the first half of 2023. WFC expects to carry on with these initiatives this year, which will likely keep supporting its bottom-line growth.Speaking of WFC's deposits, the same witnessed a CAGR of 1.5% for the three years ended 2022. Although the metric declined in the first half of 2023 and is expected to continue moderating in the near term, the considerable strength in the consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period.The company maintains a strong liquidity position. As of the second-quarter 2023 end, its liquidity coverage ratio was 123%, which is above its regulatory minimum of 100%. Its liquid assets (including cash and due from banks, as well as interest-earning deposits with banks) totaled $155.33 billion as of Jun 30, 2023.Even though Wells Fargo has a total debt (comprising of long-term and short-term borrowings) of $254.86 billion (as of Jun 30, 2023), given its solid liquidity position, the company is well-positioned to meet its debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.In addition, Wells Fargo's meaningful capital deployment efforts through regular dividend payments and share repurchases bode well for enhancing its shareholder wealth.Analysts seem optimistic regarding WFC’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised 2.7% upward over the past 60 days. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesOver the past three months, shares of WFC have gained 3.1% compared with the industry's upside of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the company's revenue growth has been distressed for quite some time now and it witnessed a negative CAGR of 3.9% over the last four years (2018-2022). Though revenues increased in the first half of 2023 on elevated trading activity, the same may not be the case in the upcoming quarters. Also, higher funding costs are expected to impede net interest income (NII) and revenue growth in the near term.WFC has witnessed a decline in loans over the past several years on planned run-off from non-strategic/liquidating portfolios. We expect its loan balance to remain disappointing with the asset cap remaining in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding compliance and operational risk management. This is likely to hurt NII growth.Rising mortgage rates and a decline in originations are expected to reduce Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking income, which consists of activities such as residential and commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing. The metric saw a three-year (ended 2022) negative CAGR of 20.1%, with the year-over-year decline continuing in the first half of 2023.Bank Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Moreover, no evidence was found that could prove the chief executive, Charlie Scharf, and senior diversity executives had knowledge about the sham interviews.The plaintiffs through the class action suit claimed that Wells Fargo had inflated its stock price by issuing public statement discussing its guidelines mentioning workplace diversity. The said policy was adopted in 2020 and required at least 50% of candidates, who were interviewed for jobs paying at least $100,000, to be minorities, women or people from other disadvantaged groups.WFC has been facing legal hassles and operational challenges. In May 2023, it agreed to pay $1 billion related to a lawsuit accusing the bank of overstating its progress on resolving its 2016 fake account scandal and thereby defrauding shareholders. Though past litigations prove misleading statements by WFC, it cannot be considered as sufficient proof regarding its intent to defraud shareholders.Apart from various litigation expenses, the company has been slapped with numerous penalties and sanctions, including a cap on the asset position by Federal Reserve. These are likely to increase expenses in the upcoming period, limiting the company’s bottom-line growth.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 8.1% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 10.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWFC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE: PFE) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Naoki Okamura, ""Astellas"") today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted Priority Review for the companies' supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for XTANDI® (enzalutamide) for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC; also known as non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer or nmHSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR). The FDA grants Priority Review to medicines that may offer significant advances in treatment or may provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for an anticipated FDA decision is in Q4 2023.Pfizer | Astellas""The FDA's granting of a Priority Review designation reinforces the need to bring new treatment options for patients with high-risk biochemical recurrent nmCSPC,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer, Executive Vice President, Pfizer. ""We believe the EMBARK data demonstrate the potential of XTANDI, if approved, to help patients earlier in the course of their disease, building on XTANDI's foundation as an existing standard of care in prostate cancer.""""Biochemical recurrence can be one of the first indicators that prostate cancer is returning or will spread, particularly among those patients that experience rapid PSA doubling times,"" said Ahsan Arozullah, M.D., MPH, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development, Astellas. ""The goal of treatment in this setting is to delay the spread of the cancer cells to other parts of the body. The addition of XTANDI to leuprolide has shown greater clinical benefit compared to placebo plus leuprolide, and we look forward to working with the FDA and other global regulatory authorities to bring XTANDI to these patients.""Story continuesThe sNDA is based on results from the Phase 3 EMBARK trial, which evaluated patients with nmCSPC with high-risk BCR across three study arms: XTANDI plus leuprolide (n=355), placebo plus leuprolide (n=358), or XTANDI monotherapy (n=355). The study met its primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS) for the XTANDI plus leuprolide arm, demonstrating a statistically significant 58% reduction in the risk of metastasis or death over placebo plus leuprolide (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.42; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.30–0.61; p&lt;0.0001). The overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of each of the medicines. The most common adverse events in those treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide were fatigue, hot flush, and arthralgia and in those treated with XTANDI monotherapy were fatigue, gynecomastia, and arthralgia. Detailed results from the trial were presented as a plenary session during the 2023 American Urological Association Annual Meeting on April 29.The sNDA for XTANDI in nmCSPC with high-risk BCR is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program and Project Orbis, two initiatives of the FDA designed to bring safe and effective cancer treatments to patients as early as possible. RTOR allows the FDA to review components of an application before submission of the complete application. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines by participating international partners.The EMBARK data are being discussed with other regulatory authorities around the world to support potential additional license applications for XTANDI in this indication in 2023 and beyond.About EMBARKThe Astellas- and Pfizer-led Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,068 patients with nmCSPC with high-risk BCR at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients who were considered to experience high-risk BCR had a prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 9 months; serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L); and screening PSA by the central laboratory ≥ 1 ng/mL if they had a radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as primary treatment for prostate cancer, or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had radiotherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Patients in the EMBARK trial were randomized to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus leuprolide (n=355), enzalutamide 160 mg as a monotherapy (n=355), or placebo plus leuprolide (n=358). Leuprolide 22.5 mg was administered every 12 weeks.The primary endpoint of the trial was MFS for enzalutamide plus leuprolide versus placebo plus leuprolide. MFS is defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For more information on the EMBARK trial (NCT02319837) go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.XTANDI, either in combination with leuprolide or as a monotherapy, has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of patients with nmCSPC with high-risk BCR.About Non-Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with High-Risk Biochemical RecurrenceIn non-metastatic castration- (or hormone-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC or nmHSPC), no evidence of the cancer spreading to distant parts of the body (metastases) is detectable with conventional radiological methods (CT/MRI), and the cancer still responds to medical or surgical treatment designed to lower testosterone levels.1,2 Of men who have undergone definitive prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or both, an estimated 20-40% will experience a BCR within 10 years.3 About 9 out of 10 men with high-risk BCR will develop metastatic disease, and 1 in 3 will die as a result of the recurrence.4 The EMBARK trial focused on men with high-risk BCR. Per the EMBARK protocol, patients with nmCSPC and high-risk BCR are those initially treated by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, or both, with a PSA-DT ≤ 9 months. High-risk BCR patients with a PSA-DT of ≤ 9 months have a higher risk of metastases and death.5 In the U.S., it is estimated that 12,000-16,000 patients are diagnosed with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR annually.6About XTANDI® (enzalutamide)XTANDI® (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. XTANDI is a standard of care and has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC; also known as metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer or mHSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). XTANDI is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 100 countries, including in the U.S., European Union and Japan. Over one million patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.6U.S. Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).Warnings and Precautions Seizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer's disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space-occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity: Reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease: In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs): In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If coadministration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI.Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Moderna MRNA, BioNTech BNTX, Novavax NVAX and Pfizer PFE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:U.S. Government to Urge Citizens to Get New Covid-19 ShotsOn Aug 21, shares of several COVID-19 vaccine developers rose after a Reuters article suggested that the Biden administration will start a fall campaign urging all Americans to inoculate themselves with the updated COVID-19 vaccines.The report came to light amid the rising COVID-19 infection cases as new subvariants of the virus continue to emerge. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), total hospitalizations due to COVID-19 rose by almost 22% in the most recent week.In response to the article, shares of Moderna, BioNTech and Novavax rose 9.3%, 6.5% and 13.0%, respectively, on Monday. All these vaccine makers are slated to roll out their respective updated vaccines during the upcoming fall season. These updated vaccines are likely to protect against the newer variants of the virus, including EG.5 (also known as ‘Eris’).Recently designated by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a variant of interest, Eris is currently the dominant variant in the United States. Infection cases from FL.1.5.1 (also known as ‘Fornax’) are growing in the United States. Per the latest CDC data, Eris is responsible for more than 20% of COVID-19 infections in the country, while Fornax accounted for over 13% of all cases nationwide.Last week, Moderna reported preliminary results from a clinical study showing that its updated COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273.815 significantly boosted neutralizing antibodies against the Eris and Fornax variants.Moderna has also submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is also currently under review in Europe.Story continuesThis June, BioNTech and partner Pfizer submitted filings in the United States and Europe seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the fall season. Last week, Reuters reported that the updated BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was effective against the Eris variant in a study conducted on mice. BioNTech/Pfizer expects to prepare their updated vaccine for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Alongside its second-quarter 2023 results, Novavax announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated COVID-19 vaccine. It aims to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Novavax stated that it is manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate commercially, intended to be in the market during the upcoming fall vaccination campaign. Novavax aims to make its updated vaccine available and accessible on par with other COVID-19 vaccines.The vaccine makers are suffering a heavy beatdown in product sales and market value as COVID-19 cases have significantly dropped compared with the last couple of years. Though the current rise in COVID-19 infection cases is expected to help revive demand for vaccines and support these companies in driving the top and the bottom line, a substantial boost, which was observed in the last few years – is unlikely.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-215316850.html,1692741196,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 4.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of -64.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.4%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 indicates a change of -2.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -33.8%. The $66.47 billion and $66.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -33.8% and -0.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani explains the new vaccine and the outlook for future vaccine rollouts, while also commenting on Novavax's (NVAX) statements assuring its new vaccine protects against new COVID-19 variants.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, Pfizer's vaccine-- moving on to another mover, Pfizer's vaccine to protect babies from RSV has officially been approved by the US FDA. It's now expected to be available in the third quarter of 2023. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now. And Anj, the shares are not moving much I guess because this was expected at some point and also because we're not quite sure what the outcome is sales wise now, right?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. While it is expected that there will be some uptake for this RSV vaccine, it isn't as, say, a big mover the way that COVID was for the company. So this vaccine is a similar formulation from the one that was just approved for adults older than 60. It is meant for pregnant women who are between 32 and 36 weeks. That's when they receive the shot. And it protects their babies up until six months after being born.Now, this is something that really affects the younger and older populations more in this vaccine, specifically for severe illness, not milder infection. So really under five years and over 60 years of age are where you see the most hospitalizations and deaths and impact. Up to 2 million kids under the age of five are impacted every year by this, so it is a concerning one. But as you mentioned, not so much a driver for them.Now, we do know that, of course, they're planning to launch the 60 and older drug in Q3, and there is a question mark on when the maternal vaccine will be ready because the CDC has not yet signed off. There is a meeting slated for October, which is when that decision could come through.And because the two doses are the same, they have already been-- Pfizer has already been producing these doses, and so it should be ready to get off the shelves as soon as the CDC gives their green light. So that's where things stand for that right now. Definitely welcome news, of course, for the younger population. But as you mentioned, it's a question mark for Pfizer.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Anjalee, while we've got you, we've got another question mark for you. In other news, Novavax is saying its vaccine protects against new COVID variants. What can you tell us there?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Novavax just confirmed what they'd already said, which was that their vaccine-- the latest one that's going to be updated and authorized if the FDA gives it the go ahead for later this fall-- is protective against the new variants that we've seen circulating that is part of that Omicron family, including the one nicknamed Eris.So we know that, as of right now, across the board, the three vaccine companies that are planning updated COVID vaccines-- so that's Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax-- have all indicated that they're going to be ready for the XBB variant that they were initially formulating for and then the new ones, all, again, part of the Omicron family, so should be protective even with the immune evasive properties that we're seeing.JULIE HYMAN: Thanks, Anjalee.

Crypto markets dropped sharply towards the end of last week, leaving analysts and investors looking to traditional financial markets for an explanation. Here’s what you need to know:1. From stocks to bitcoin, soaring US yields cast shadow over risk asset rally2. Why PayPal’s stablecoin is likely to succeed where Facebook’s Libra failed3. Bitcoin drops to new two-month low as world markets sell off Bitcoin’s latest drop Bitcoin has fallen sharply, dropping to as low as $25,350 on Tuesday. On Thursday last week, it fell 7.2%, its biggest single-day drop since Nov. 9 2022, which was the day it became clear that Binance wasn’t going to rescue FTX. Now, crypto is caught up in what analysts call a broader “risk-off” move in financial markets, as increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will leave interest rates higher for longer has caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise over the last month or so, eventually hitting their highest levels since 2007. Rising yields hurt riskier assets, so small companies that burn through investor cash and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies – which conversely did well when rates were low and borrowing was cheap – have been particularly hard hit. But it can’t all be blamed on rates. Analysts also suggested (1) a lack of retail investor interest in crypto at the moment (2) a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk’s SpaceX had sold its bitcoin holdings after writing down the value by $373 million (3) low volatility in crypto markets and (4) hopes that the SEC would approve a spot bitcoin ETF starting to fade. Speaking of risk, a report from the Bank of International Settlements found that in developing economies crypto assets have not only failed to deliver on their promises but are also adding to financial risks there. Crypto assets have the “illusory appeal” of being a quick and solution for financial problems, especially in emerging markets, but ""have so far not reduced but rather amplified the financial risks in less developed economies,"" the report said. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said he is “subsisting on bread and water” because the jail where he is being held has not given him the vegan diet he asked for. His lawyer said a lack of adequate food and medication at the notorious jail (see last week’s story on that here) makes it harder for Bankman-Fried to prepare for his upcoming fraud trial. Crypto EssentialsStory continues* SBF’s prep time: Bankman-Fried’s got an “extraordinary volume” of evidence to review before his trial in October, his lawyers say.* Coinbase’s win: The U.S. exchange got permission to sell futures on cryptocurrencies to U.S. retail customers.* PayPal’s pause: PayPal will stop selling crypto to UK customers as it tries to comply with new marketing rules.* Changes at Circle: Coinbase said it will buy a stake in the company behind USDC, Circle Internet Financial, and shut down the separate body that used to jointly manage it.* Titan settles: A New York investment adviser agreed to pay over $1 million to settle SEC charges that it misled investors about how clients’ crypto assets were performing, Crypto Graph The crypto derivatives market is currently dominated by offshore exchanges, mainly Binance, and it has shrunk this year as crypto volumes fall.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -19.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 points to a change of +19.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.61 indicates a change of +13.4% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.69 billion and $32.4 billion estimates indicate +7.9% and +9.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.43%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 3.57, the question arises: is the stock significantly undervalued? This article offers a detailed valuation analysis to answer this question. Read on for an insightful exploration of PayPal Holdings' intrinsic value.An Introduction to PayPal HoldingsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLSpun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) provides electronic payment solutions to merchants and consumers, focusing on online transactions. The company had 435 million active accounts at the end of 2022. It also owns Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.At its current price of $60.46 per share, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market cap of $66.40 billion. Interestingly, the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, stands at $142.11, suggesting that the stock might be significantly undervalued. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesPayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is believed to be significantly undervalued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. Because PayPal Holdings is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisThese companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, an investor must review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. PayPal Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.94, which ranks better than 66.8% of 509 companies in the Credit Services industry. The overall financial strength of PayPal Holdings is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of PayPal Holdings is fair.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. PayPal Holdings has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $28.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.57. Its operating margin is 16.68%, which ranks worse than 53.02% of 381 companies in the Credit Services industry. Overall, the profitability of PayPal Holdings is ranked 10 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 73.29% of 498 companies in the Credit Services industry. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.3%, which ranks better than 53.96% of 278 companies in the Credit Services industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, PayPal Holdings's ROIC was 16.66, while its WACC came in at 11.8.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisConclusionOverall, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is believed to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 53.96% of 278 companies in the Credit Services industry.

213,b76e3e91-fa5e-393e-94fd-c56f81f99eaa,IBM,2023-08-23,IBM taps AI to translate COBOL code to Java,TechCrunch,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b76e3e91-fa5e-393e-94fd-c56f81f99eaa/ibm-taps-ai-to-translate.html,1692730879,STORY,['IBM'],"[COBOL, or Common Business Oriented Language, is one of the oldest programming languages in use, dating back to around 1959. It's had surprising staying power; according to a 2022 survey, there's over 800 billion lines of COBOL in use on production systems, up from an estimated 220 billion in 2017.But COBOL has a reputation for being a tough-to-navigate, inefficient language. Why not migrate to a newer one? For large organizations, it tends to be a complex and costly proposition, given the small number of COBOL experts in the world. When the Commonwealth Bank of Australia replaced its core COBOL platform in 2012, it took five years and cost over $700 million.Looking to present a new solution to the problem of modernizing COBOL apps, IBM today unveiled Code Assistant for IBM Z, which uses a code-generating AI model to translate COBOL code into Java. Set to become generally available in Q4 2023, Code Assistant for IBM Z will enter preview during IBM's TechXchange conference in Las Vegas early this September.Code Assistant for IBM Z is designed to assist businesses in refactoring their mainframe apps, ideally while preserving performance and security, according to IBM Research chief scientist Ruchir Puri. Running locally in an on-premises configuration or in the cloud as a managed service, Code Assistant is powered by a code-generating model, CodeNet, that can understand not only COBOL and Java but also around 80 different programming languages.""IBM built a new, state-of-the-art generative AI code model to transform legacy COBOL programs to enterprise Java with a high degree of naturalness in the generated code,"" Puri told TechCrunch in an email interview. ""In addition to code transformation, Code Assistant supports the complete application modernization life cycle and helps developers understand, refactor, transform and validate the translated code in a modern architecture.""Puri says that CodeNet, which was trained with 1.5 trillion tokens and has 20 billion parameters, was engineered with a large context window -- 32,000 tokens -- to ""capture the broader context"" for ""more efficient COBOL to Java transformation."" Parameters are the parts of a model learned from historical training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, such as generating text, while tokens represent raw text (e.g. ""fan,"" ""tas"" and ""tic"" for the word ""fantastic""). As for context window, it refers to the text the model considers before generating additional text.Story continuesThere's a number of tools, apps and services to convert COBOL apps to Java syntax today, some of which are entirely automated. Puri acknowledges this but makes the case that Code Assistant takes steps to avoid sacrificing COBOL's capabilities while delivering on reducing costs and producing code that's easy to maintain -- unlike some of the rival offerings on the market.""IBM built the Code Assistant for IBM Z to be able to mix and match COBOL and Java services,"" Puri said. ""If the 'understand' and 'refactor' capabilities of the system recommend that a given sub-service of the application needs to stay in COBOL, it'll be kept that way, and the other sub-services will be transformed into Java.""That's not to suggest that Code Assistant is flawless. A recent Stanford study finds that software engineers who use code-generating AI systems similar to it are more likely to cause vulnerabilities in the apps they develop. Indeed, Puri cautions against deploying code produced by Code Assistant before having it reviewed by human experts.""Like any AI system, there might be unique usage patterns of an enterprise's COBOL application that Code Assistant for IBM Z may not have mastered yet,"" Puri said. ""It's essential that the code is scanned with state-of-the-art vulnerability scanners to ensure code security.""Risks aside, IBM no doubt sees tools like Code Assistant as important to its future growth. Today, about 84% of IBM's mainframe customers run COBOL -- mostly customers in the financial and government sectors. And while IBM's mainframe division is still a large portion of its overall business, the company views the mainframe as a bridge to the expansive, lucrative hybrid computing environments that it also hosts and facilitates.IBM sees a future in broader code-generating AI tools, as well -- intent on competing with apps like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In May, IBM launched fm.model.code within its Watsonx AI service, which powers Watson Code Assistant, allowing developers to generate code using plain English prompts across programs, including Red Hat’s Ansible Lightspeed.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/ibm-taps-ai-to-translate-cobol-code-to-java/]"

And A.I. is the only answer we got.”Working-age populations in some of the world’s most important economies such as Japan, South Korea, the U.K., and China are indeed declining, according to the World Bank. In the U.S. the picture was a little rosier, with the numbers of workers remaining flat since 2020 after decades of steady increases—a trend likely exacerbated by the Great Resignation.Krishna was also responding to the unusually tight U.S. labor market that has made it difficult to hire enough employees. His point was that firms can no longer hire as many new employees as they would like, and therefore must get accustomed to doing more with less, or at least the same resources they currently have.With A.I., Krishna says, companies “can get the same work done with fewer people—that’s just the nature of productivity.”He’s convinced humans will work alongside A.I. rather than be replaced by it. “You get digital labor or A.I. bots augmenting or working alongside their fellow humans doing that work,” he said.In a commentary for Fortune in April, Krishna provided some examples of how he expected that process to play out. Citing the example of human resource departments, he said IBM can now deploy just 50 workers using A.I. to do what previously required 700 employees.“That’s freed up a very significant number of people to spend more time providing important talent-related services, such as career guidance and support for managers, which requires thought and creativity, rather than doing routine paperwork,” he wrote.Story continuesJobs that require repetitive, manual tasks are the ones that Krishna thinks are first in line to be impacted by A.I. “I actually believe that the first set of roles that will get impacted are, what I call, back office, white-collar work,” said Krishna. And while that raises the specter of mass unemployment and pervasive job cuts, Krishna has said previously that A.I. will create more jobs than it eliminates. Whether his prediction comes to fruition remains to be seen.An IBM spokesperson said the company had nothing to share beyond beyond Krishna's CNBC interview and Fortune commentary.This wasn’t the first time Krishna has spoken about artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs. In May, he said IBM would freeze hiring for 7,800 roles the company thought could be replaced by A.I.In Tuesday’s CNBC interview, Krishna said he was “slightly misquoted” in the coverage of those remarks. Rather than eliminating those roles, IBM simply won’t backfill those that are left open through the normal annual attrition of 5% to 6%. Crucially, the policy will be in place only for five years, after which presumably hiring will pick up again, but for a host of new roles created because of A.I.IBM was among the first companies in artificial intelligenceIBM was among the earliest players in artificial intelligence. Long before generative A.I. became available to the public through services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, IBM had created Watson, a machine-learning-powered tool that responded to natural language. The initial promise of Watson—that it could help in health care and professional services—may not have panned out. Customers mostly felt the tool was limited to answering trivia questions, rather than revolutionizing how people work.But IBM took the experience it gained by developing Watson as a universal application and tweaked its business model to create A.I. tools for specific use cases. To cater to A.I. developers, IBM introduced Watsonxai, a service that provides access to large language models that are the basis for most artificial intelligence technologies. Like many others the company also jumped headfirst into generative A.I. with Watson Assistant, meant to rival ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. Additionally, IBM has an A.I. tool called IBM RXN for Chemistry, which is pitched as being able to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions.Krishna reiterated on Tuesday his belief that A.I. would be universally applied, saying it will make “every enterprise process more productive.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Given inflation and rising interest rates, it's getting harder and harder for Americans to be able to buy a new vehicle, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal Financial Reporter Ben Foldy explains that buyers of both new and used vehicles are seeing higher prices, with the average monthly new car payment totaling about $750. With more people struggling to make that type of payment, Foldy tells Yahoo Finance Live, ""what's interesting is that normally you see that struggling, those delinquencies and stuff, kind of tick up when you have problems in the job market, and obviously we don't have that yet."" Foldy notes the issue could be worsened by the resumption of student loan payments in the fall. Watch the video above to find out what Foldy says about what this means for carmakers.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Cost of new vehicles in July was up 3 and 1/2% from a year ago. And this year, there's only one new vehicle model that's selling for less than $20,000. Those higher payments are starting to pinch drivers. So here with a closer look at this Wall Street Journal, reporter Ben Foldy. Ben, it's good to see you. You had a piece in the Journal last week, highlighting some of the troubles here that car buyers are facing. Given the higher costs of vehicles today, what are we seeing as a result?BEN FOLDY: Yeah. I think for those of us who can't afford $25 million Rolls-Royces, the payments are starting to pinch, I mean, both in used and new prices have kind of steadily gone up during the pandemic. And I guess, actually, they're kind of peaking now. I think your graphics showed that the month-on-month was actually down. So it seems like we're probably at the peak for new cars. But for everybody who bought a car at the peak, you know, a year ago or a year and a half ago, they're having to keep up with these payments. And the average the average monthly new car payment is $750 bucks or it's around in that ballpark.Story continuesAnd so as rates have gone up, even as prices have moderated a bit, now you're still paying a lot for your car. And, you know, people are struggling I think. And what's interesting is that normally, you see that struggling and kind of those delinquencies and stuff kind of tick up when you have problems in the job market. And obviously, we don't have that yet. So I guess one of the questions is, how narrow is that kind of landing strip for the soft landing if there does. If there is a recession and there are impacts on the job market like, is there going to be kind of a hockey stick of distress and auto lending?DIANE KING HALL: And so Ben, I want to ask you, what did your reporting show you with regard to where the distress is kind of starting to pile up? I mean, we have-- you know, we have seen these prices go higher. I was surprised to see that there was only one car, like one vehicle, below that like. I looked at-- I was like, well, let me look up a Honda Civic and see what that's going for now. And you're right, it is higher than 20,000. So with that distress piling up, what is your reporting show you in terms of who you talk to about where it's affecting Americans?BEN FOLDY: Yeah. I think it's definitely more noticeable in subprime, which I think people with below, I think, 660 is the cut for subprime, so people with kind of more subpar credit. And I think that makes sense for a number of reasons. I mean, a, those are kind of riskier borrowers to start. There's kind of higher expectations for loss. But then you also, you know, if you make some, you know, assumptions, let's say, but like, you know, so subprime buyers are probably more likely to rent than to buy.So they aren't on refinanced mortgages paying a quarter-- you know, 1% or whatever. And rent, actually, has gone up quite a bit during the pandemic. So that's been a stress that doesn't necessarily show up in debt service coverage ratios. And one of the analysts I was speaking to was talking about that is that there's kind of a hidden rent impact there.One of the other things that I think we should look for in the coming months is, you know-- and again, this goes back to subprime and younger borrowers-- is the resumption of student loan payments, which will, you know. There's been this holiday on student loan debt for, I guess, almost three years. And that's coming to an end at the end of the month.And one of the factors that TransUnion, the credit scoring agency, pointed out in their seminar on this was that, of consumers that have outstanding student debt, they-- about, I think, more than 33%, 34% of them took on a new auto loan during the pandemic. And again, so they take on that new loan while their student payment is frozen.But that loan is also-- they're basically buying in the peak of the market for either used or new. So their payments are going to, you know-- if the payment shock of the student loan comes back and they're already kind of struggling to keep up, which I think we can see in the delinquency data, there could be kind of more distress ahead.SEANA SMITH: So, Ben, what do you think this ultimately means for the car makers? Because up until this point, they've been able to pass along higher prices. They've been able to focus on the higher end cars, the luxury cars, because people were buying them. Now that seems to have shifted, right? Consumers are under even more pressure than they had been in prior months. So do you think we'll ultimately see car makers being forced here to lower their prices?BEN FOLDY: I think it's-- I think there's definitely an opening. I think there's openings for kind of the more budget manufacturers. And you've seen kind of foreign automakers tend to kind of fill that space, where it's basically impossible to get an American-made sedan at this point. And so I think there's an opportunity for that.It's hard to say. I mean, without kind of-- without the distress of kind of a broader macroeconomic , slowdown it's possible that this could kind of be the new normal. But I have trouble seeing that as a long-term future. I think profitability will be compressed at some point.DIANE KING HALL: And, Ben, I want to ask you what did your reporting show you in terms of trends with regard to used car tradings? Because you remember there was a period of time that we'd really never seen before, where you could get more for your used vehicle than what you bought it for. Has that trend decelerated from what you've seen in your reporting?BEN FOLDY: Yeah. So if you-- the Manheim Index, which tracks used car value, has come back to Earth. I mean, it's still pretty-- it's still very elevated relative to what it was in 2019, you know, pre-pandemic. But if you-- I think you point to an interesting question. And, actually, it alludes to the last one, too, which is that where this is going to bite down the road is if you bought your used car in 2022, in the first half of 2022-- again, you bought at the peak of the market-- you're going to go underwater on that loan much quicker, because the depreciation of that used car is going to be steeper.And that's going to, A, make it more obnoxious to pay your loan. But, B, It's also going to cut into your trade-in value. So that's actually one place where the automakers may get hit kind of down the line is that people are going to have less money to play with the next time they need a car, because whatever they bought, they bought at a much higher rate than-- a higher rate and higher price than whatever they're getting in the trade. And so that's going to bite back.SEANA SMITH: And we are starting to see consumers under more and more pressure with their auto loans. All right, Ben Foldy of the Wall Street Journal, thanks.BEN FOLDY: Thank you.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -15.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 11.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.1%. This estimate has changed +9.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.22 indicates a change of -5% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $43.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $171.23 billion and $175.72 billion estimates indicate +9.3% and +2.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $44.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.1%. EPS of $1.91 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.34%. The EPS surprise was +10.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Brand strength, robust marketing and innovative initiatives have also proven fruitful.Moreover, McCormick's Global Operating Effectiveness (""GOE"") and Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) programs are a testament to its commitment to operational excellence. Efficient pricing actions have been working well for the company and are likely to help it cover cost inflation.The combination of these factors propelled McCormick's performance in the second quarter of 2023, wherein earnings and sales increased year over year, and the former beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Robust year-to-date results, the expectations of solid demand and a focus on the cost structure encouraged management to raise its adjusted operating income and earnings per share (EPS) view for fiscal 2023 while keeping the sales view unchanged.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAcquisitions – a Major Growth CatalystMcCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions to grow its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce, a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.MKC believes that the buyout of Cholula accelerates its growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category. Further, the company's acquisition of the food division of RB Foods (concluded in August 2017) is noteworthy. Some of the other noteworthy acquisitions of McCormick are Italy-based Enrico GiottiSpA (December 2016) as well as Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016).Story continuesCCI &amp; GOE Initiatives Aid MarginsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing CCI program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, thereby leading to higher sales and profits. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points due to efficient pricing, an improved product mix and cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs.The GOE program aims at optimizing MKC’s supply chain and cost structure. McCormick expects savings from its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses. It expects savings from the GOE program to have an 800-basis point impact on adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2023. Savings from the CCI program are likely to be $85 million in fiscal 2023. Such cost savings, coupled with effective pricing actions, are likely to continue enhancing the company’s profits in the future.Cost ChallengesMcCormick has been grappling with cost inflation for a while now. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, though the adjusted gross margin increased year over year, it was partly offset by escalated cost inflation. Further, SG&amp;A expenses increased year over year due to elevated employee incentive compensation expenses and increased distribution costs.McCormick also witnessed a spike in brand marketing costs in the second quarter. It expects an even greater year-over-year rise in brand marketing costs in the third quarter, which is likely to increase the company’s SG&amp;A expenses. MKC also anticipates a significant rise in interest expenses in fiscal 2023.Encouraging GuidanceFor fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 10-12%. Management envisions fiscal adjusted EPS in the band of $2.60-$2.65. The bottom-line view suggests growth from $2.53 recorded in fiscal 2022. The bottom-line growth is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.

225,62eca94a-17ed-34c1-9b7f-bcc2d2aadb0c,UAL,2023-08-23,"United (UAL) May Find a Bottom Soon, Here's Why You Should Buy the Stock Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-ual-may-bottom-soon-215145840.html,1692741105,STORY,['UAL'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in United Airlines (UAL) lately. While the stock has lost 5.1% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this airline enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.What is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for UALThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for UAL lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering UAL are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that UAL currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 1 for United is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""We thought we had adequately reserved for it. However, the number of incidents and the organized retail crime impact came in significantly higher than we anticipated, and that impacted our Q2 results.""The unexpected shrink, or theft, weighed on the company's adjusted earnings per share which came in at $2.80 in the second quarter, about a dollar short of analysts expectations for $3.81. Dick's management team said on the earnings call that it expects shrink to also ""remain elevated"" through the back half of the year. The retailer cut it's full-year profit outlook due to the rise in retail crime. Dick's now sees full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $11.50-$12.30, down from a range of $12.90-$13.80.""This is an issue that has negatively impacted many retailers, but has not been called out by DKS previously,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham wrote on Tuesday.Dick's gross margins of 34.4% fell 5% from the same period in the year prior, and came up short of Wall Street's estimates for 36.3%. Gupta said shrink attributed to ""one third"" of the gross margin decline. The other portion of the decline came from ""decisive actions"" such as writing off outdoor products.""There's a very short window in which to sell through (outdoor goods), and so we were aggressive,"" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said. ""But it doesn't change our expectations on the outdoor category in general...This was a short-term issue this quarter.""Quarterly sales of $3.22 billion came in just shy of expectations for $3.24 billion and the retailer maintained its outlook for comparable sales to end the year in a range of flat to up 2% when compared to the year prior.Story continues""We saw growth across every single income demographic,"" Hobart said. ""We did not see a trade down from best to better or better to good product...It is really clear and important to note that our consumer is doing very well.""MUNCY, PENNSYLVANIA, UNITED STATES - 2022/11/21: A Dick's Sporting Goods store stands at the Lycoming Crossing Shopping Center in Muncy.

Last week, Target, Home Depot (HD), and Walmart (WMT) all called out shrink on their earnings calls. ""In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the company's earnings call.""Shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years. It's something we're tackling every day.""On Tuesday's call, Hobart described shrink as a ""industry-level problem,"" and believes companies need to work with trade organizations and government to address the issue.""We are going to fight to the extent we can to keep our teammates, our athletes, and our stores safe, and that's with increased security, with lock lock-hop cameras, and working with local law enforcement and with our industry partners,"" Hobart said.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

235,ce83a838-ee3b-3921-bc73-452b69d8d5bf,ISRG,2023-08-23,The 7 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-healthcare-stocks-230703599.html,1692227223.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'UNH', 'PFE', 'VKTX']","[Investors always hope to buy low and sell high. In order to do so, it’s necessary to identify stocks that are undervalued. The healthcare sector, like all other sectors, is rife with opportunities and offers lots of value. While the undervalued pricing is important, it’s also important to note that healthcare stocks to buy offer relative safety. The sector tends to perform well in all markets: Whether the market is up or down, people need healthcare. As a result, the shares of firms engaged in the business tend to operate with relative steadiness. So, if you can find inexpensive healthcare stocks to buy, the results are often profitable investments. Here are a few to consider.Healthcare Stocks to Buy: Pfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is one of the most undervalued healthcare stocks to buy at the moment. The narrative for bullish sentiment is very straightforward: Pfizer is undergoing a Covid-19 hangover and the markets have discounted it as a result. The company’s revenues spiked as a result of its success in developing a commercially viable vaccine. However, those revenues have fallen off as the pandemic ended.I like to refer to the arc of Pfizer’s revenues when discussing the current opportunity. Pfizer reported roughly $40 billion in sales in each of the three years between 2018-2020. That doubled in 2021 and reached $100 billion by 2022 on vaccine commercialization. The company should reach $65 billion in sales this year with plans to launch nearly 20 products in the next year and a half. Buy it and receive a dividend yielding 4.5% for your patience in Pfizer’s developmental prowess. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZymeworks (ZYME) Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nursesSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.comZymeworks (NASDAQ:ZYME) focuses on difficult-to-treat cancers and other diseases. The company is on the cusp of commercializing its lead candidate drug Zanidatamab. In addition, the company has an impressive roster of partners that includes some of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical industry. Further, ZYME stock trades at $7 and has the potential to double. Story continuesZanidatamab is an antibody targeting the HER2 receptor and is being studied for its use in treating HER2-specific cancers. The drug is currently in multiple pivotal clinical trials meaning it’s potentially very close to US FDA marketing approval. That pipeline can be found here. Based on its most recent 10-Q the company should have no problem continuing to approach commercialization for several years. Healthcare Stocks to Buy: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is one of the top healthcare stocks to buy. So, just how much is it undervalued? The easiest way to answer that question is to look at its current price and compare it to where Wall Street believes UNH shares are headed. Fortunately, priced at $503 now and valued at $573 there’s roughly a 14% return expected at the moment. That doesn’t include UnitedHealth Group’s dividend which adds an additional 1.5%. UNH shares have done incredibly well over the past decade returning 23% on an annual basis during that period. The company is growing rapidly despite its size. Revenues crossed the annual $300 billion threshold in 2022 and might exceed $400 billion in 2024.It’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t require a ton of thought. UnitedHealth Group is almost certain to grow your money in a short period of time and is likely to continue growing it thereafter. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) a doctor looks at a tabletSource: ShutterstockInvesting in Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) stock requires one to get behind a relatively simple thesis. The recent decline in its share price was based on a knee-jerk reaction that is illogical at its root. That knee-jerk reaction followed data related to Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) weight loss drug, Retatrutide. The drug is proving effective with weight loss and is seeing unmatched efficacy so far. However, that’s not what’s important in relation to Viking Therapeutics, which hopes to commercialize a drug that reduces fat in the liver caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Retatrutide is also proving efficacious in reducing liver fat. That news caused VKTX and other NASH stocks to drop precipitously. However, Retatrutude is only in phase 2 clinical trials. It may never reach commercialization. And even if it does, there’s no way to know if it will be approved for NASH or how far down that path Eli Lilly might go. That idea is likely why Viking Therapeutics is showing signs of rebounding of late. It still has a great chance of success and the market’s overreaction is your opportunity. Healthcare Stocks to Buy: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comMany readers will remember how negatively the pandemic affected Intuitive Surgical’s (NASDAQ:ISRG) stock. Patients were afraid of hospitals and thus avoided elective surgeries that used the firm’s Da Vinci robots. You might be surprised to learn that the company continues to deal with that same issue. Procedure volumes have been negatively affected in parts of Asia where Covid hospitalizations remain elevated. That said, Intuitive Surgical continues to rebound. Global Da Vinci procedures increased by 22% in the second quarter. The company increased its base installations of Da Vinci systems by 13% to 8,402 in total. Revenues are up, net income is rising, and there’s plenty of upside in ISRG stock that remains for investors who pull the trigger right now.  The firm has no debt at all and is financially sound overall. Its products have very strong margins meaning investors can logically expect roughly 25% of its sales to end up as net income. And it’s growing rapidly as the pandemic wanes globally. Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) a photo of a stethoscope laying atop medical papersSource: ShutterstockZimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH) sells orthopedic reconstructive products. Those who have had a knee, hip, shoulder, or foot/ankle surgery very well may have contributed to the stock’s performance. Like Intuitive Surgical, Zimmer Biomet is bouncing back nicely as the pandemic subsides globally. Sales increased by 7.4% during the first half of the year with higher growth and volumes in the domestic market. The international market is still marred by the same issues that affect Intuitive Surgical. Anyway, investors should be very interested in how rapidly the firm’s net income has rebounded. The firm reported $167 million in earnings during the first half of 2022. That figure increased to $442 million this year. The company’s strategy is straightforward: It establishes relationships with orthopedic surgeons as a vendor and high switching costs tend to keep the relationship strong. It develops and introduces new products into those channels and thus the firm grows. LivaNova (LIVN) two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockLivaNova (NASDAQ:LIVN) sells oxygenators, heart-lung machines, and transfusion systems among other devices. It’s also growing quickly and recently saw its revenues increase by 15.6% to $293.9 million. The company expects to grow by as much as 10% this year and there’s roughly 20% upside baked into target prices at the moment. Despite the positive outlook and expectation of growth for investors, LivaNova does have some current issues. For one, expense increases outstripped profit growth during the period. The result was that income fell precipitously for the firm.  The company is now under the direction of an interim CEO so it’s clear that there are some issues to sort out. That said, the company has a decent amount of analyst coverage and the consensus is that shares will grow. The company has operated for 5 decades so it’s inevitable that it has faced adversity before. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

With the highly anticipated economic recession that never materialized, retail stocks have experienced some considerable revisions higher to their earnings estimates, boosting the near-term expectations of their stock prices.That isn’t to say the economic picture is perfect though. One interesting trend to emerge this year is the strength of discount retailers. With inflation continuing to put pressure on consumers’ budgets, many are preferring to shop where the prices are lower.Stocks like Ross Stores ROST and The TJX Companies TJX, who represent some of the top discount retailers, have seen strong upward trending earnings revisions, bullish prices action, and strong Q2 earnings that are beating analyst estimates.Sprouts Farmers Market SFM is another retailer that is building a powerful business, although it isn’t in the discount segment. All three of these stocks have top Zacks Ranks and are sitting at or near the all-time highs in their stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss StoresRoss Stores is a well-known off-price retail chain that operates under the brand names ""Ross Dress for Less"" and ""dd's DISCOUNTS."" ROST offers a wide range of discounted apparel, footwear, home goods, and accessories from various brands.With a focus on providing value-conscious consumers with quality products at affordable prices, Ross Stores has built a strong customer base. The company's unique business model of purchasing excess merchandise from manufacturers and department stores enables it to offer customers significant discounts. Ross Stores has a strong presence in the retail sector and continues to expand its footprint, making it a prominent player in the off-price retail industry.During its most recent quarterly earnings report Ross Stores beat earnings estimates by 13.5% and sales estimates by 4% confirming the flight to discount thesis. Following the trend, ROST has experienced some significant earnings estimate upgrades giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Top of FormStory continuesCurrent quarter earnings have been revised higher by 5.3% and are projected to grow 20% YoY to $1.20 per share. FY24 earnings have been increased by 5.7% and are expected to climb 18.5% YoY to $5.19 er share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss Stores stock has an extremely impressive long-term performance, nearly 4x that of the broad market over the last 20 years. During that period ROST has compounded at an annual rate of 16.7%. Interestingly, the stock has been trading sideways for almost five years now, however it looks like a big breakout could be just around the corner.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll that sideways trading has allowed ROST to bring down its earnings multiple and has become even more appealing in valuation terms over that time. Ross stores is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.8x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and below its five-year median of 23.6x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is another leading off-price retailer that operates popular brands such as T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and Sierra. With a vast network of stores, TJX offers a diverse selection of discounted apparel, home goods, and accessories from various brands.The company's unique business model involves sourcing merchandise from a wide range of suppliers, including manufacturers and department stores, allowing it to offer customers quality products at reduced prices. This approach has helped TJX build a loyal customer base that seeks value and treasure-hunt shopping experiences. As a result, TJX has established itself as a major player in the off-price retail segment and continues to expand its presence both domestically and internationally.Just last week The TJX Companies reported stellar Q2 earnings, beating analysts estimates on both the top and bottom line. In Q2 TJX witnessed a 6% increase in overall comp store sales, driven solely by customer traffic. Marmaxx's comp store sales surged by 8% in the same period, with strong performance in both its apparel and home segments. The pretax profit margin for Q2 improved by 1.2 percentage points compared to the previous year, reaching 10.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter reached $0.85, marking a 23% increase from the previous year.These results sent TJX stock to new all-time highs, where it currently sits. Additionally, the company returned $932 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As a result, the company has raised its outlook for FY24 in terms of overall comp store sales, pretax profit margin, and earnings per share.This exceptionally strong quarter has prompted analysts to increase their estimates nearly unanimously as well, giving TJX a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been boosted by 1% and are expected to climb 11.6% YoY, while FY24 estimates have been raised by 3.7% and are expected to grow 18.7% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.1x, which is below the industry average of 26.5x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSprouts Farmers MarketSprouts Farmers Market is a grocery store chain specializing in natural and organic products. With a focus on healthy and sustainable offerings, SFM provides fresh produce, natural meats, bulk foods, vitamins, and more. The company emphasizes a farm-to-table approach and aims to provide customers with affordable, high-quality options for healthier living.Sprouts Farmers Market sits at an interesting intersection of trends that should play in its favor for years to come. With a focus on healthy and sustainable offerings it plays off the broader trend towards mindfulness around healthy consumption. But it also makes sure to concentrate on value and inexpensive options, which can be hard to do when providing high quality products.Sprouts Framers Market’s expansion hasn’t gone unnoticed, and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Over the next 3-5 years earnings are expected to grow 9.3% annually, while sales are projected to grow 6% YoY during the next two years.SFM stock has been making very steady gains since putting in a low during the Covid-19 pandemic. And although the stock is up 60% over that time, outperforming the broad market, it still offers an extremely compelling valuation today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSprouts Farmers Market is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.3x, which is below the industry average of 16x, and below its 10-year median of 18.8x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionWhile retail has gone through some tremendous changes over the last decade thanks to the explosion in e-commerce, the industry has stabilized as more people realize there will always be a place for brick-and-mortar consumption. Additionally, with the incredible and persistent strength the US economy has demonstrated, it looks like there may be an extended period of retail success over the next few years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s use of non GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain acquisition related expenses1, which are described further below. Adjusted gross margin percentage represents adjusted gross margin divided by revenue.Adjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating expenses percentage represents adjusted operating expenses divided by revenue.Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by revenue.Adjusted nonoperating expense (income) is defined as nonoperating expense (income), determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, which is described further below.Adjusted income before income taxes is defined as income before income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below.Adjusted provision for income taxes is defined as (benefit from) provision for income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding tax related items4, which are described further below. Adjusted tax rate represents adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes.Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, special charges, net3, and tax related items4, which are described further below.Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net. Free cash flow revenue percentage represents free cash flow divided by revenue.1Acquisition Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to debt, inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include fair value adjustments associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.2Acquisition Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.3Special Charges, net: Expenses, net, incurred as part of the integration of Maxim, in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, other accelerated stock-based compensation expense and other cost reduction efforts or reorganizational initiatives. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.4Tax Related Items: Income tax effect of the non-GAAP items discussed above, an income tax benefit from a discrete item related to a federal corporate income tax relief claim, certain other income tax benefits associated with prior periods and an income tax benefit from a discrete tax item related to the consolidation of certain subsidiaries. We excluded the income tax effect of these tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.About Analog DevicesAnalog Devices, Inc.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$200 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$172. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Analog Devices' current trading price of US$177 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices Is Analog Devices Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $204.94, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Analog Devices’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Analog Devices look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 19% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Analog Devices. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. If you want to see which blue chip stocks haven't done well this year, then you can check out 15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. Some top stock picks in the list of undervalued blue chip stocks favored by hedge funds are Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

M3 months agoMyles UdlandSurvey says — The US economy continues to lose momentumThe initial read on economic activity in August from S&amp;P Global out Wednesday pointed to a further loss of momentum in the US economy.The firm's services PMI reached a six-month low at 51.0 while its manufacturing PMI came in at 47.5, a two-month low. For these surveys, readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector while readings below 50 indicate contraction.""A near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of US economic growth in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""The survey shows that the service sector-led acceleration of growth in the second quarter has faded, accompanied by a further fall in factory output.""Williamson added the report shows companies see ""demand [that] is looking increasingly lethargic in the face of high prices and rising interest rates,"" though notes a softening in demand could help inflation pressures continue to ease somewhat.In recent months, survey data like S&amp;P and the ISM's PMI reports have suggested a softening in economic conditions more dramatic than what has been seen in the monthly jobs reports, retail sales data, and GDP reads. Other measures like the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker are in outright conflict with survey-level data.How — or if — these tensions are resolved will be key to the US economic story as we head towards 2024.A3 months agoAlexandra CanalStocks open higher ahead of Nvidia earningsUS stocks opened higher on Wednesday as investors await Nvidia earnings.

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry, then check out 5 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Technology is one of the most glamorous and lucrative industries these days. The soaring popularity of technology firms and stocks follows the massive impact that personal computing, connectivity, and the Internet have made on our lives. In fact, nearly every aspect of modern day living, whether it's work, transportation, entertainment, shopping, or business, has been revolutionized by technology and the firms that play a role in this have seen their shares rewarded heftily on the stock market.When we look at mega cap stocks, out of the ten largest companies traded on U.S. exchanges in terms of market capitalization, eight are technology stocks. This makes the segment one of the most lucrative in the world, and it is also a segment that has defied investor expectations and soared to new highs in 2023. The broader economic environment this year has been worrying, to say the least, with the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes jolting the stock market last year. These hikes were expected to continue this year, but very few investors could have predicted in 2022 that the first half of 2023 would see big tech retake most of 2022's losses with the tech heavy NASDAQ 100 index gaining 45% between January to June.Leading the charge in the mega cap arena is the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares have gained more than 300% on the stock market this year, fueled by the firm's stunning guidance for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2023. While Wall Street analysts were expecting the firm to guide the Q2 revenue at $7.2 billion, NVIDIA blew past these estimates as it projected its first annual revenue growth in the last couple of quarters by expecting the net sales figure to sit at $11 billion. Analysts were delighted, to say the least, and they have rated NVIDIA's shares as Strong Buy on average. As if this weren't enough, the firm's average share price target is $524.19, and based on the closing share price at the time of writing, this pens in an upside of 14.8%. Briefly looking at recent analyst coverage, out of the ten analyst notes that have covered the shares, eight have rated them as either Strong Buy, Overweight, or Outperform.Story continuesThe surge in NVIDIA's shares is part of the broader hype in the industry surrounding artificial intelligence. AI is a set of technologies that leverage high powered computing systems to use pre determined relationships to generate insights into new data. The uptick of AI by firms has been equally explosive, with data from McKinsey showing that in less than a year after the debut of the latest technologies, nearly 25% of top level executives said that they are using AI technologies while 40% have already set AI as an agenda on their board. Bifurcating the responses according to industries, the top two industrial users of AI are the technology &amp; telecommunications and financial services industries. In terms of business roles, marketing and product development professionals are the highest users of AI while manufacturing and supply chain people rely the least on the latest technology. One additional industry that heavily benefits from AI and has been using it even before the recent mania is the biotechnology sector, and for more details on this particular front, be sure to check out 11 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today.Shifting gears from technology to financial evaluation, one way in which stocks are valued is the price to earnings ratio. This ratio comes in several flavors, out of which the most popular is the price to trailing earnings ratio. If you want to find out what this ratio is all about, we've covered it in detail in 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. As a short primer for the sake of this piece, this ratio divides a firm's current share price with its earnings per share in its four latest quarters, providing a moving valuation that incorporates the latest financial results to gauge market sentiment about a stock. A P/E ratio below an industry average implies that a stock is undervalued and its share price can potentially appreciate in the future. A ratio that is higher than the average can indicate, purely from a P/E ratio perspective, that the price might come down in the future. We've sifted dozens of stocks through their P/E ratios, in pieces such as 10 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To Invest In and 12 Undervalued European Stocks to Buy.Today, we'll take a look at undervalued technology stocks being bought by hedge funds, out of which the top picks are Avnet, Inc.

265,c8f5eff1-4892-3218-9168-58a1ff7493c4,MCK,2023-08-23,30 Countries with Longest Life Expectancy in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-longest-life-expectancy-112848550.html,1692790128,STORY,"['UNH', 'MCK', 'CVS']","[This article covers 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023, with insight into current life expectancy trends, the healthcare industry, and how life expectancies vary across different regions. For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023. Life expectancy is a significant factor that helps determine the overall well-being and health of the people in a country. Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on age-specific death rates.  Life expectancy trends throughout the globe are readily changing, even in the countries with the longest life expectancy, as recorded by various studies. As per data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been significant progress in the life expectancy of people across the globe in the past few decades. From an average of 43.5 years recorded in 1950, it has increased to 72.6 years in 2023. This improvement can be a result of advancements in public health measures, medical science, and nutrition. The Current State of the Healthcare IndustryIn 2021, the global healthcare industry was valued at around $104.44 billion and is projected to increase to a figure of $272.76 billion by the end of 2027. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 20% in the designated period.  As of now, there are many well-known names in the healthcare market, such as CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and McKesson Corp.(NYSE:MCK) to name a few, all with revenues in billions of dollars.  Where contributions to the field and new medical discoveries are concerned, CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) focuses on the physical and emotional well-being of the patients, whereas UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) offers insurance and consulting services. Meanwhile, McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) has expanded its services in the US, Canada, as well as Europe.  Unsurprisingly, all three companies have a market capitalization of billions, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) leading the charge with $486.6 billion, followed by CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) at $124.8 billion and McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) coming with $53.3 billion.  With the rising market capitalization and revenues of healthcare companies, it stands to reason that countries are moving towards efficient and advanced solutions and people are becoming more health-conscious.  Governments are also playing their roles in improving life expectancy. Since seniors are the most at risk when it comes to health concerns, governments in different countries are increasing healthcare expenditures for them. The US is one such example, which spends 2.4 times more on the elderly, as compared to the younger population. Moreover, healthcare systems are directly linked to an increase in life expectancy across the globe. In a study conducted, researchers concluded that if healthcare is made available to the population as a whole, it could extend the longevity of life. This is also an indicator of the improved life expectancy in countries with advanced healthcare solutions and systems. Story continuesThe Role of AI in the Healthcare IndustryDue to advancements in technology, artificial intelligence (AI) is readily implemented in numerous fields, with healthcare being no exception. As of now, the global AI market is believed to grow significantly. In 2020, AI in the healthcare industry was around $14 billion and has been projected to reach up to $119 billion before 2028.  AI has also made substantial progress in the field of anti-aging drugs, which can effectively eliminate senescent cells. These are faulty cells that are a result of various conditions, like Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. In this year alone, Harvard Medical School was able to successfully develop chemical cocktails, which contain various agents that help with treating mental and physical disorders. After extensive successful testing on monkeys and mice, the experts believe that they will soon be able to revive human cells and reverse cellular aging. With the rise in AI healthcare and machine learning (ML) applications in the industry, healthcare can aid in further improving life expectancy. This could especially have a hold in countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, China, and the US, which are leading the market in AI.  Thus, it stands to reason that life expectancy in these countries is higher than most, and why they are not on the list of the 30 Countries with the Lowest Life Expectancy 2023. MethodologyFor our list of 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023, we used two core metrics to support the study: Life expectancy by country of both sexes and infant mortality rate per 1,000 births. The reports used to ascertain the primary metrics include the Life Expectancy of the World Population Index by Worldometers and the Infant Mortality Index by CIA.gov.  The reason we chose two metrics is that life expectancy is primarily used to offer a holistic overview of the health of the population. Meanwhile, infant mortality focuses on the relevant health risks that are specific to the younger population. Together, these two indexes offer a distinct perspective on the overall well-being and survival rate of the people of the country. We first assigned countries on each indicator a score of 1-30 (1 indicating the best rank and 30 the lowest on our list), to standardize our evaluation. To combine these metrics into a single ranking, we calculated the weighted averages of both metrics, while assigning a weight of 0.5 to each indicator. Finally, we ranked countries in descending order from 30-1 based on composite results, with 30 indicating the country with the shortest life expectancy and 1 indicating the country with the longest life expectancy on our list.  Below is our complete list of 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023.Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy in 202330.

Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years.

The company’s success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, and its ability to increase engagement and demonstrate the value of its services to existing and potential clients, Network Partners and members.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 9.7% north to $1.92.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $238.8 million, suggesting a 15.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

268,acb6bc9a-3cf9-3166-89ef-f0b937d59a48,MCK,2023-08-23,Masimo's (MASI) PVi Favored by Study for GDFT in Elderly Patients,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimos-masi-pvi-favored-study-170500160.html,1692723900,STORY,"['MASI', 'MCK', 'PDCO', 'HQY']","[Masimo Corporation MASI recently announced the findings of a prospective, randomized study in which researchers assessed the use of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index (PVi), as part of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), to guide intraoperative fluid administration during gastrointestinal (GI) surgery on elderly patients by comparing it to conventional fluid therapy. The findings were published in Perioperative Medicine.The latest positive study outcome is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s real-time patient monitoring business and is likely to solidify its position in the niche space on a global scale.Significance of the StudyThe researchers noted the value of optimizing fluid management during GI procedures, especially in elderly patients, because of the high rate of postoperative complications and frequent fluid deficits. Hence, they sought to determine whether GDFT using Masimo PVi might improve outcomes in this scenario.Currently, PVi is indicated as a non-invasive, dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness in select populations of mechanically-ventilated adult patients. Per the researchers, PVi has been shown to perform similarly to invasive methods of fluid assessment, such as pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation, in various surgeries.The researchers concluded that intraoperative GDFT based on simple and non-invasive PVi did not reduce the occurrence of composite postoperative complications among elderly patients undergoing GI surgery. However, it was associated with a lower cardiopulmonary complication rate, unlike usual fluid management.Per management, PVi’s utility as a fluid responsiveness indicator has been demonstrated in more than 100 independent, published studies. Management believes that the latest study will likely add to the outcomes evidence that PVi can be used to aid clinicians in managing the fluid levels of their patients without invasive catheters.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global fluid management devices market was valued at $4,563.0 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $13,292.76 million by 2031 at a CAGR of 11.3%. Factors like the rise in the number of minimally invasive surgeries, an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases and technological advancements are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the positive study outcome is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Masimo reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an expansion of its installed base. Management confirmed that the company gained new hospital customers during the quarter at a record level. The expansion of both margins in the quarter was also recorded.The same month, Masimo announced the findings of a study in which researchers evaluated the ability of Masimo SedLine brain function monitoring to assess the sedation levels of patients undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine (a sedative with numerous advantages). The findings were published in Frontiers in Neuroscience.In June, Masimo announced that Valencia, Spain-based Hospital La Fe will be expanding its telehealth and telemonitoring program with the Masimo W1 advanced health-tracking watch.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 26.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s 2.3% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 6.9% growth in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

APD, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD and Albemarle Corp. ALB.Industry: ChemicalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2138478/3-diversified-chemical-stocks-to-watch-amid-demand-woesThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is grappling with a slowdown in demand in certain markets and consumer inventory destocking. Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China are impacting demand.Industry players like Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and Albemarle Corp. are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes to tide over the challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building &amp; construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture.Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?Demand Headwinds From End-market Weakness: Companies in the chemical-diversified space are facing headwinds from a slowdown in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building &amp; construction market and the destocking in consumer electronics are key concerns. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building &amp; construction. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes. Weaker global economic activities have led to a higher level of uncertainties, which may affect chemical volumes over the near term.Story continuesSlowdown in Europe and China a Worry: A slower recovery in economic activities in China following the lifting of the restrictions related to the resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting chemical demand in that country. Global industrial activities have been affected by the weaker demand recovery in China.The slowdown in Europe resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation has also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation has resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions is likely to impact demand for chemicals over the short haul.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. These include the reduction of discretionary spending. The industry players are also raising selling prices to counter raw material and logistics cost inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector.

273,0f4a9e35-435a-360e-a2a6-38cc559156fb,CMI,2023-08-23,Diesel engines not going away just yet: Cummins CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/diesel-engines-not-going-away-211840349.html,1692739120,VIDEO,['CMI'],"[As the EV revolution in the auto industry continues to grow, Cummins CEO Jennifer Rumsey joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company's strategy and how it will still be making diesel engines over the next 10 years. “It’s important to realize that commercial and industrial applications are quite different than passenger cars,” Rumsey says. Customers “need to run equipment that will allow them to be profitable and successfully meet their business requirements,” Rumsey explains. Customers are “really interested in initial cost and total cost of ownership in these technologies,” Rumsey says. “There’s a range of different applications when you look across different commercial and industrial applications,” such as a bus, pickup, or delivery truck, and they each have “very different power, weight, range, and life requirements that drives different solutions.” “Over the next 10 years… we’re going to continue to grow in the engines that we provide to our customers around the world,” Rumsey says.Video Transcript- I grew up seeing Cummins on the sides of trucks, and I'm very familiar with your engines. And as you mentioned, you're over 100-year-old company. How do you change mindsets inside of Cummins to position for future then in some respects you can't quite see yet?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Well, the history of Cummins is actually all about embracing change and the need to drive change to innovate and grow the company. So we've done that for my now more than 20-year career. First with NOx and particulate emissions, and advancing our engines, and growing our components business, which didn't exist 15 years ago, based on that innovation and that need.And so we're doing just that again. We're embracing this need for change, driving innovation, advocating for change that will enable our customers to continue to be successful. And they serve the heart of our economy, of course, commercial and industrial equipment, while also addressing a very real issue that our planet faces, which is climate change. And doing our part to contribute to positive change there.Story continues- We are well familiar with the story on what the automakers are doing. So they're rolling out electric vehicles. At the same time, they're coming out with more hybrids. But their cash cow remains gas-powered engines for trucks and vehicles. What is the view inside of Cummins over the next decade? Will you still be making diesel engines?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Yeah. So the short answer to that question is yes. It's important to realize that commercial and industrial applications are quite different than passenger cars. First of all, for many of us, you and I, I know included, we buy cars based on emotional buying choices.- That's me. I'm raising my head, Jen. That's me.JENNIFER RUMSEY: Right. Me too. Emotional decision on what car I buy. But our customers are making business decisions. They need to run equipment that will allow them to be profitable and successfully meet their business requirements. And so they're really interested in initial cost and total cost of ownership in these technologies.Second is there's a range of different applications. When you look across different commercial and industrial applications from a bus, to a pickup and delivery truck, to a heavy duty long haul truck, a large mining truck, there's very different power, weight, range, and life requirements that drives different solutions.So over the next 10 years, for much of that time, we're going to continue to grow and the engines that we provide to our customers around the world. Our business last year was a total of $28 billion. And that was predominantly our core business for Cummins. This year, our Accelera business will be $350 to $400 million. So still quite small.Looking forward to 2030, we'll continue to grow that core business. We project $33 to $35 billion. And the Accelera by Cummins business will become much more significant, in the range of $6 to $13 billion. So through this decade, we'll continue to see growth across Cummins business.- Jennifer, is it unrealistic to expect in our lifetimes we're going to see roads where they're predominantly going to be Tesla Cybertruck. Not Cybertrucks. The Tesla Semi trucks. Is that in our lifetime, or do we still need a massive improvement in America's infrastructure?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Well, there's a lot of investment required to build out an infrastructure and bring out the cost of these solutions. And it's important that we start today. So we are focused on some of the applications we're putting infrastructure in place and making the economics work with incentives make sense, like bus applications. And you see that moving into medium duty.There we're starting to see adoption of battery electric powertrains. The reality is for long haul trucks, our view is hydrogen as more likely to be the long term solution, either hydrogen-based engine solutions or hydrogen-fueled fuel cells. Some battery solutions and certain truck applications, and that will take more time. So in my lifetime, I hope that we see many more of those trucks running on the road. But I do think it's going to be beyond my lifetime before we see that full transition.- I can't think of another company that has a better pulse in the economy six months, 12 months from now than Cummins. What do you see in the United States? I think there's a lot of fears about a slowdown into the second half of this year. What does your backlog say?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Yeah. So we're coming out of a period where we had incredibly high demand, and our customers were using their products heavily. Through the 2021-'22 time frame, a lot of supply constraints that prevented us from being able to build to the full industry demand.So what that's meant is well we've seen a little bit of softening in that economy, we still have very strong backlogs in many of our markets, and there's other places where we're seeing infrastructure and other things continue to maintain strength. So we're coming off of a record quarter for Cummins in Q2. We're projecting growth across the company for this year but some softening as we get to the back half of this year in certain markets, for example, our heavy duty truck, certain global markets, and even a little bit in the construction market.- I know you have a big business in China. Is that part of the slowdown you're seeing?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Yeah. China has actually been quite slow for the last couple of years. So really at a level lower than we've seen in many years as a result of the very stringent COVID lockdown policy and the sluggish economy that we see in China. So that market for us continues to be quite depressed. We're projecting some slow recovery but really not seeing any dramatic signs of improvement in the market in China.- And I know it was-- I'm sure it's a proud moment for you and your company when President Biden visited a Cummins facility earlier this year, I believe it was April. As we get into election season and whatever that might entail, what is the next administration, whoever it might be, what do they need to do to make your life easier in the world of manufacturing in this country?JENNIFER RUMSEY: Yes. So we have made investments in our Fridley plant in part because of some of the incentives that have been in the Inflation Reduction Act that drive adoption of hydrogen and green hydrogen. So that's one of our businesses within Accelera, is electrolysers for green hydrogen production and very excited about the business opportunity that we have there.We continue to advocate across both parties and around the world for the legislation and incentives that we think will enable the transition that is necessary to decarbonize our planet. And that's something that we're going to continue to do. Those incentives are really critical to create certainty for businesses to invest and enable our customers to adopt these technologies today where they're still more expensive.By doing that, that then allows scale up and innovation to occur to occur, and then the technologies will become more cost competitive, the infrastructure will be built out, and the economy can continue to thrive at sustain with these lower carbon solutions into the future.- Thanks to Cummin chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, as well as Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi.]"

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts.

276,2fcb3e93-39dc-3263-b276-13313aa20773,DIS,2023-08-23,Streaming cancellation rates rose in July: Report,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/streaming-cancellation-rates-rose-july-211424438.html,1692738864,VIDEO,"['PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX', 'AAPL', 'WBD', 'DIS']","[Streaming subscriber churn rates — or the number of subscribers that cancel their subscription plans — rose across all major streaming platforms in June, according to data from Antenna. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal compares the year-over-year churn rates for streamers such as Apple TV (AAPL), Disney+ (DIS), Max, (WBD), Netflix, (NFLX), and Paramount (PARA), while commenting on the content crunch weighing on subscriber retention.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: There is a big issue facing the streaming giants as they compete for customers-- subscriber churn rates. We have some new data out today from Antenna. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the breakdown. So Allie, where are we at with this churn rate?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So churn is basically the rates of which subscribers are abandoning their streaming plans. And we're seeing that come as prices have ballooned across the board. We were just talking about last week how the golden age of streaming. It's no longer there anymore.But looking at this churn data, all the major subscriber platforms, also their churn levels increase. Now Antenna does define the monthly churn rate as cancels in a given month divided by subscribers at the end of the previous month. They also those rates increase except for one company. Who do you think it was?SEANA SMITH: Netflix.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Netflix. Now, the churn rate in the year-ago period for Netflix was 3.1%. This was 3%. So a slight deceleration there. And you could think that's probably due to the fact that we saw the password sharing crackdown. Netflix also is just very broad in their content, which I think is critical. But a lot of analysts that I've spoken with said that churn, subscriber churn in particular, is one of the biggest issues facing these media giants, especially as profitability continues to be a struggle here with losses mounting as well.SEANA SMITH: So Allie, how do you think that then shapes their strategy, right? Because they need to raise prices because they need to focus on profitability. But also they want to keep those churn rates low. They want to keep as many subscribers as possible.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: So there's a few things these platforms should be focusing on. One is original content and perhaps movies. So think libraries of content. That was one of the reasons why analysts were so bullish on Disney, because they have all that IP. They have all of those movies that kind of attract people to the platform. So if you focus on original content, that hopefully leads to engagement.Engagement is another thing that's important. You want people to be on your platform as long as they possibly can. How do you do that? By having a wide range of content, content that appeals to all different types of people, everyone in the family. That's something that Max is really trying to lean in on. It's something that Netflix has already been able to accomplish. And now they're adding more international content, which is increasing their exposure overseas, which is a great thing when you think about the writers strike, the SAG-AFTRA strike, everything going on in Hollywood right now.So those are the things that I think will influence strategy moving forward. And with that, I think is going to come some M&amp;A and some more media consolidation. So that you can kind of cut your losses and bolster where you can. So TBD.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It would be interesting to see who exactly partners with who--ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's going to happen. It's just a question of when. And you're right.DIANE KING HALL: We talked about this. Exactly. But no surprise about Netflix, though.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.DIANE KING HALL: You know. I mean, habits--ALEXANDRA CANAL: They're number one, man. It's crazy.DIANE KING HALL: All right. Alexandra Canal, thank you.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank you.]"
277,604d8021-36c7-4286-82fe-21dfdd5d43f9,DIS,2023-08-23,Hollywood strikes:  'A lose-lose situation' as fears mount over a $4 billion economic hit,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hollywood-strikes-a-lose-lose-situation-as-fears-mount-over-a-4-billion-economic-hit-193730757.html,1692733050,STORY,"['PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'DIS', 'AAPL', 'CMCSA', 'AMZN', 'WBD', 'NFLX']","[Hollywood studios will once again meet with striking writers this week as negotiations drag on, surpassing the 100-day mark. But the economic impact of the ""double whammy"" work stoppage, experts said, is only just beginning.""We met this week and continued to exchange proposals,"" the Writers Guild of America (WGA) wrote to members on Friday, adding, ""The Guild will communicate when we think there is something of significance to report.""SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — also remains firmly on the picket lines after joining striking writers in mid-July.The bottom line: ""We're inching towards compromise,"" Scott Purdy, KPMG’s US national media leader, told Yahoo Finance.The WGA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment, in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming. These demands are similar to those made by the actors' guild.Purdy predicted the strikes could likely last ""two to three times"" the prior 2007-2008 strike, which lasted for 100 days. That means a work stoppage that can run well into 2024.""The negotiating will happen when the pain on both sides gets to be too much,"" Purdy said. How so? When writers and other content producers can't hold out any longer without a source of income — and the studios run out of new content.He added: ""I really think there's too much pain to miss an entire other season. Right now it's a lose-lose situation.""Hollywood actors Susan Sarandon, Rosie Perez, Ezra Knight, and Julianna Margulies chant slogans as they participate in a picket line outside Warner Bros., Discovery, and Netflix offices in Manhattan, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo)Profitability, of course, remains top of mind for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Warner Bros., Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA) — hence the standstill in negotiations.Story continuesThe double strikes, meanwhile, will likely have serious economic implications, as the last writers' strike demonstrated.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., that work stoppage cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes could cost the national economy $4 billion-plus. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides just production — restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""A strike like this, especially as it's expanded to not just the writers but this time with the actors, is a total stoppage to almost everything that's scripted,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""And it's not just impacting these industries in California, but also [New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh] and all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.""Klowden shared Purdy's view that both sides will eventually have to cave, ""but it doesn't seem like either side is ready to"" right now.The strategist noted churn, or consumers cancelling their streaming plans due to a lack of content, will likely be a critical factor in determining a possible end date. Higher streaming prices have also caused further concerns.Still, Klowden warned nobody is safe, especially coming out of the pandemic.""Everybody's in a precarious position,"" he said. ""Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:OKE) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 71% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-nyse-oke-favoured-104920591.html,1692787760,STORY,['OKE'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in ONEOK implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 48% ownership Recent purchases by insiders Every investor in ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of ONEOK, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for ONEOK ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ONEOK?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in ONEOK. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ONEOK's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ONEOK. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of ONEOKThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of ONEOK, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$196m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over ONEOK. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  ONEOK is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At M&amp;T BankIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Senior EVP &amp; Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible bought US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$121 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$128. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the M&amp;T Bank insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 10.39k shares for US$1.3m. On the other hand they divested 5.03k shares, for US$783k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by M&amp;T Bank insiders. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At M&amp;T Bank Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significantly more insider buying, than insider selling, at M&amp;T Bank. In total, Senior EVP &amp; Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible bought US$1.2m worth of shares in that time. But insider Doris Meister sold shares worth US$323k. Insiders have spent more buying shares than they have selling, so on balance we think they are are probably optimistic.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that M&amp;T Bank insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$112m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The M&amp;T Bank Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about M&amp;T Bank. That's what I like to see! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - M&amp;T Bank has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.But note: M&amp;T Bank may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

WTI hit a one-month low at $77.62 earlier. The U.S. crude benchmark is down some 2.3% week-to-date, after shedding an identical percentage last week following a seven-week rally that left WTI up nearly 20%.Brent settled down 82 cents, or almost 1%, at $83.21 per barrel. The global crude benchmark was down nearly 2% on the week, extending last week’s 3% drop after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.Oil prices dipped for a third day in a row despite the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, saying in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that crude stockpiles fell by 6.135M barrels during the week ended Aug. 18.The crude stockpile drop came on top of the 5.960M-barrel decline reported by the EIA for inventories in the prior week to Aug. 11. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a decline of just 2.850M barrels for the just-ended week.Upstaging the crude inventory decline were U.S. gasoline inventories, which registered a surprise build last week against expectations for a drop. Stockpiles of distillates, meanwhile, jumped four times more than forecast, the EIA said.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA reported a build of 1.467M barrels, after a slide of 0.261M barrels last week. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.888M for last week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a climb of 0.945M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.296M. Analysts had predicted a build of just 0.218M for last week. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.The EIA’s reports on oil and fuel inventories have turned volatile lately as global stockpiles see shifts from Saudi and Russian maneuvers to slash exports amid slower buying from China.Story continuesU.S. crude output at 3-year highAlso, quite unexpected was the EIA’s higher estimate for U.S. crude output for a third week running.Crude output was projected at 12.8M barrels per day during the week to Aug. 18, making it the agency’s highest such estimate since the record 13.1M barrels produced daily before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.Over the past three weeks, the EIA has constantly raised production estimates for oil by 100,000 barrels each week under a new reporting methodology that accounts for oil potentially flowing from active oil wells compared with those that are drilled but uncompleted — the latter referred to as DUCs.“Earlier this year the EIA revised the number of drilled but uncompleted wells in the top U.S. shale basin, adding several years’ worth of unreported DUCs,” said Phil Flynn, an energy analyst at Chicago broker Price Futures Group.Flynn said the revisions imply that drilling-rig productivity has been higher than past estimates despite the U.S. oil rig count having fallen by more than 15% this year.The EIA “believes active drilling rigs were about 10% more productive in 2021–2022 than previously estimated”, Flynn added.The revisions to the EIA’s reports also come as global oil supply sees shifts from Saudi and Russian efforts to slash production and exports amid slower buying by top oil importer China which is facing an economic crunch.U.S. export escalationHigher drilling efficiency aside, U.S. oil producers also seem to be pushing for volume now. There has been a sheer escalation in exports from the world’s largest producer of the commodity, ostensibly to feed demand coming from markets that could be underserved by the Saudi-Russian cuts.The EIA report for the week ended August 18 also showed a staggering 10.544M barrels per day of exports of both crude and fuel oils from a total crude production of 12.8M. That means just 2.256M barrels of crude per day were for domestic consumption, with the balance 82% going towards exports.“It looks like U.S. energy companies are really stepping up to the plate to ostensibly make up for some of the vacuum in oil supplies resulting from the Saudi-Russian cuts,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Saudi Arabia, which has been producing oil at well below its capacity for more than a year now, announced an additional million barrels per day reduction in July that it said will carry through to September at least. Cargo tracking data by Kpler also suggests that Russian exports may fall by as much as one million barrels per day this month as the Kremlin seeks to tighten production.(Additional reporting by Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick)Related ArticlesOil prices dip as U.S. fuel demand disappoints; Crude output at 3-year highGold settles above $1,900 first time in 2 weeks as dollar, yields coolOil edges down as demand woes outweighs big draw in crude stocks]"

The Saudis have pledged to keep up with such cuts through September.Along with the broader crude stockpile gain it reported for last week, the API cited a slide of 2.21M barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that takes delivery of U.S. crude. In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of 1.0M barrels.On the fuels side, API reported a gasoline slide of 0.153M barrels and a distillate stock build of 1.898M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 0.7M barrel draw for gasoline and 0.8M deficit for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that fell for the first time last week after a seven-week rally.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.299 million barrels, versus the 5.96M barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug 11.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a build of 0.436M barrels over the 0.261M-barrel decline in the previous week.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Colgate-Palmolive:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.29 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Colgate-Palmolive compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 45% where it was five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Colgate-Palmolive's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And with the stock having returned a mere 24% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   3 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

But the economic impact of the ""double whammy"" work stoppage, experts said, is only just beginning.""We met this week and continued to exchange proposals,"" the Writers Guild of America (WGA) wrote to members on Friday, adding, ""The Guild will communicate when we think there is something of significance to report.""SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — also remains firmly on the picket lines after joining striking writers in mid-July.The bottom line: ""We're inching towards compromise,"" Scott Purdy, KPMG’s US national media leader, told Yahoo Finance.The WGA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment, in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming. These demands are similar to those made by the actors' guild.Purdy predicted the strikes could likely last ""two to three times"" the prior 2007-2008 strike, which lasted for 100 days. That means a work stoppage that can run well into 2024.""The negotiating will happen when the pain on both sides gets to be too much,"" Purdy said. How so? When writers and other content producers can't hold out any longer without a source of income — and the studios run out of new content.He added: ""I really think there's too much pain to miss an entire other season. Right now it's a lose-lose situation.""Hollywood actors Susan Sarandon, Rosie Perez, Ezra Knight, and Julianna Margulies chant slogans as they participate in a picket line outside Warner Bros., Discovery, and Netflix offices in Manhattan, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Profitability, of course, remains top of mind for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Warner Bros., Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA) — hence the standstill in negotiations.Story continuesThe double strikes, meanwhile, will likely have serious economic implications, as the last writers' strike demonstrated.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., that work stoppage cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes could cost the national economy $4 billion-plus. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides just production — restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""A strike like this, especially as it's expanded to not just the writers but this time with the actors, is a total stoppage to almost everything that's scripted,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""And it's not just impacting these industries in California, but also [New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh] and all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.""Klowden shared Purdy's view that both sides will eventually have to cave, ""but it doesn't seem like either side is ready to"" right now.The strategist noted churn, or consumers cancelling their streaming plans due to a lack of content, will likely be a critical factor in determining a possible end date. Higher streaming prices have also caused further concerns.Still, Klowden warned nobody is safe, especially coming out of the pandemic.""Everybody's in a precarious position,"" he said. ""Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This twisty and timely drama follows PR specialist Gabi Mosely (Shanola Hampton) and her crisis management team as they search for missing people from marginalized groups who do not typically receive widespread media attention, as she was once one of the forgotten ones. But unbeknownst to anyone, this everyday hero is hiding a chilling secret of her own.The premise of ""Found"" shines a spotlight on the harrowing statistic that in any given year, more than 600,000 people are reported missing in the U.S. Of these reported cases, more than half of the missing people are people of color, too easily neglected by the system.Following the screening, ""Found,"" stars Shanola Hampton, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and Gabrielle Walsh sat down with Kathleen Newman-Bremang from Refinery29 Unbothered for a riveting conversation about the twists and turns in the series as well as the importance of using media to find missing people from underrepresented communities.In a Refinery29 Unbothered article about the panel, Shanola Hampton expressed: ""[I loved] being able to play a complex character who you think has it all together and she's a boss and then you see that she too has trauma. That's our theme. Trauma has no look to it. It does not discriminate. How each person deals with trauma is different.

Also, worsening economic conditions, particularly in North American construction and industrial activities, may cause weakness in the end markets.Let’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Higher Infrastructural Spending &amp; Solid 2023 Prospects: United Rentals and other construction companies are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. Notably, United Rentals is expected to maintain positive momentum in the near term, as the company’s solutions are closely aligned with President Biden’s policies and industry trends.The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to help URI. The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid, which will drive growth in 2023.URI sees substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.Higher Rental Revenues: United Rentals has been witnessing widespread growth in rental revenues, which represented 83.9% of the company’s total revenues in the second quarter of 2023. During the said period, rental revenues grew 21%.Higher Return on Equity (ROE): United Rentals’ trailing 12-month ROE is indicative of growth potential.

Let's delve into the financials and future prospects of this company.Introduction to Hasbro IncWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with HAS. Click here to check it out. HAS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HASHasbro is a globally recognized play company, offering a variety of entertainment solutions to children and families. Its diverse portfolio includes toys, games, television programming, motion pictures, and a licensing program. The company's popular brands such as Transformers, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering have a significant market presence. Hasbro's strategic acquisitions like Entertainment One and partnerships like Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beyond have further strengthened its multichannel presence.With a current stock price of $67.81 and a market cap of $9.40 billion, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) seems to be modestly undervalued compared to its GF Value of $82.09.Hasbro Inc (HAS): A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates the fair trading value of a stock. This valuation is based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If a stock's price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it indicates that the stock is either overvalued or undervalued, which can impact its future returns.For Hasbro, the GF Value suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. This indicates that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Hasbro Inc (HAS): A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisUnderstanding a company's financial strength is crucial to mitigate the risk of permanent capital loss. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Hasbro's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.05 ranks lower than 88.05% of 820 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry, indicating poor financial strength.Story continuesHasbro Inc (HAS): A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent long-term profitability and high-profit margins, is generally less risky. Hasbro has been profitable 10 times over the past 10 years. Despite a Loss Per Share of $1.85 in the past twelve months, its operating margin of 2.72% indicates strong profitability.Growth is a key factor in a company's valuation. Hasbro's 3-year average annual revenue growth rate is 4.7%, which ranks better than 65.89% of 768 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 5.5%, ranking better than 52.45% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCA comparison of a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. Hasbro's ROIC of 2.21 over the past 12 months is lower than its WACC of 6, which could be a cause for concern.Hasbro Inc (HAS): A Modestly Undervalued Stock with Potential for Higher ReturnsConclusionDespite some financial concerns, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) appears to be modestly undervalued.

Brands' shares before the 28th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.42 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Yum! Brands has a trailing yield of approximately 1.9% on its current stock price of $129.45. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Yum! Brands paid out just 23% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 52% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Yum! Brands's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Yum! Brands, with earnings per share up 5.6% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Yum! Brands has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.1% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineHas Yum! Brands got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Yum! Brands is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Yum! Brands from a dividend perspective.While it's tempting to invest in Yum! Brands for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Yum! Brands that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Brands (YUM) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-yum-brands-142300607.html,1692714180,STORY,"['YUM', 'ARCO']","[Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM will likely benefit from digital initiatives, solid comps growth and unit-expansion efforts. Also, the strength in Taco Bell’s performance bode well. However, commodity inflation is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthYum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company is accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive. In second-quarter 2023, it reported digital sales of approximately $7 billion.During the second quarter, the company emphasized developing its digital strategy and leveraging a new customer data platform solution to offer a single view of customers across all its U.S. brands and third-party aggregators. The initiative paves a path for heightened customer experience and frequency. This apart, the company reported an increase in the adoption of recommended ordering (across 800 stores) and Yum! point-of-sale system (1,000 Taco Bell U.S. stores). The company is optimistic regarding the advancements and anticipates the initiatives to unlock personalized marketing, joint branding and future automation for sales growth in the upcoming periods.Despite the challenging macro environment, the company impressed investors with robust same-store sales growth in second-quarter 2023. The company reported consolidated same-store sales growth of 9% year over year. A rise in dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships primarily backed the upside. Also, attributes including unlocking additional customer use occasions, compelling value offerings and continued digital growth added to the positives. During the quarter, same-store sales at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut rose 4%, 13% and 4% year over year, respectively. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.The company continues to focus on expansion efforts to drive growth. Considering its existing footprint of more than 50,000 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can nearly triple its current global presence over the long term. During the second quarter of 2023, the company opened 1,025 stores, resulting in a 6% unit growth on a year-over-year basis. The company reported solid developmental contributions from Pizza Hut brand in China, India, the U.S., Spain and Turkey. It also reported positive feedback from its franchise partners, envisioning broad consumer appeal and a huge untapped market opportunity. The company is optimistic with respect to its development engine and anticipates it to be a driving factor in the upcoming periods.YUM! Brands is benefiting from increased contributions from Taco Bell. During second-quarter 2023, Taco Bell's revenues were $621 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter's levels. The upside was primarily backed by same-store sales growth (of 4%) and unit growth (5%). Also, the emphasis on commercial strategies, including building brand buzz, mass occasions and digital initiatives, bode well. During the quarter, the company reported solid demand with respect to crave-able product offerings, including $5 Cravings Creo and Deluxe Build Your Own Cravings Box. It also announced the migration of Taco Bell U.S. digital traffic to the Yum! Commerce platform. During the quarter, Taco Bell's International system sales grew 18% year over year courtesy of continued development momentum and strong value propositions (through menu innovation offerings). Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, the company’s shares have gained 12.2% compared with the Retail – Restaurants industry’s 6.7% growth.ConcernsThe company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. In second-quarter 2023, its net costs and expenses amounted to $1,114 million compared with $1,082 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The transfer of business and exit from Russia incorporated certain additional costs, which hurt the company's margins. Also, spikes in labor costs and commodity inflation added to the downside. Costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investment in initiatives will likely dent margins in the near term. For 2023, our model predicts total costs and expenses to rise 3.8% year over year to $4,834 million. The company is cautious of uncertain macro environment.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksYum!

The judge did dismiss claims that McDonald's had created a hostile work environment and intentionally caused Peaster emotional distress.McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Carmen Caruso, a lawyer for Peaster, said he looks forward to bringing the surviving claims to trial.Kempczinski in 2021 sent text messages to then-Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot referencing the shooting of a 7-year-old girl at a Chicago McDonald's and another shooting of a child in the city. ""With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say,"" Kempczinski wrote, according to court filings.Kempczinski later publicly apologized and said the texts “reveal my narrow worldview that I have to work hard to correct.""At a 2021 meeting at McDonald's corporate headquarters, Peaster, the company's vice president of global safety, security, and intelligence, said Kempczinski's response to the incident had been insufficient.According to the lawsuit, Peaster at the meeting said that ""we have to have empathy and compassion for the majority of families who live in tough communities,"" among other comments.Story continuesPeaster claims that following the meeting, Kempczinski and other executives retaliated against him by refusing to meet with him and making it impossible for him to do his job. He was ultimately fired last November for alleged performance issues, according to his lawsuit.Peaster is seeking damages for the loss of his job and emotional distress, along with punitive damages.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)]"

Market participants remain uncertain up to what level the Fed will continue to hike its interest rate. Fed’s July FOMC meeting minutes clearly indicated that a majority of officials were in favor of pursuing the rate hike cycle as the inflation rate remains well above the central bank’s target level supported by resiliency in the labor market and consumer spending.Moreover, a series of bad news hit markets in August. On Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. On Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. The rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.On Aug 15, Fitch Ratings warned that it may downgrade ratings of more than a dozen U.S. heavyweight banks in the near future. Fitch said that another one-notch downgrade of the banking sector’s rating from AA- to A+ will compel the rating agency to reevaluate the ratings of all 70 U.S., banks that it covers for a possible downgrade.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have adopted two selection criteria. First, we select blue-chip stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a robust business model, a strong financial position and globally acclaimed brand value. Second, these companies came up with strong earnings results in the recently reported quarter and issued solid guidance.We have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong growth potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 20% and revenues to rise 8%.Zacks Rank #1 CAT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 40.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last seven days.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‘s JPM second-quarter 2023 results show the impacts of the First Republic Bank buyout, higher rates and worsening economic outlook. High rates, global expansion efforts and decent loan demand should support net interest income (NII) of JPM. Our estimates for NII (managed) indicate a CAGR of 5.8% by 2025. With green shoots visible in the investment banking (IB) business, IB fees are likely to witness a turnaround soon.Zacks Rank #1 JPM has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 22% and 30.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 30 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. Increased market share in grocery continued to boost U.S. comps in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Moreover, the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Strong comps growth globally, expense leverage and e-commerce growth across all units favored the company. WMT raised its guidance for fiscal 2024.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5% and 1.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.2% over the last seven days.Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ beat estimates for both earnings and sales in second-quarter 2023. JNJ’s Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels. Growth in 2023 is expected to be driven by products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.The MedTech unit is showing improving trends driven by recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products. JNJ is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.Zacks Rank #2 Johnson &amp; Johnson has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also making every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help boost McDonald's long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald’s has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.8% and 13.8%, respectively, for the current year.

The deal covers more than 300,000 employees.The union's prior contract with the delivery giant expired Aug. 1, and the Teamsters had threatened that drivers would walk off the job without a deal.Rank-and-file UPS workers voted overwhelmingly for the new labor agreement, according to the company and union officials.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip investing, then jump ahead to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Blue chip stocks are some of the safest investments that anyone can make. These firms rank among the largest in the world, have stable operations, well developed markets, sizeable revenues, and often pay dividends. This lends their share prices stability, and more importantly particularly when we take a look at the currently uncertain economic environment, limits the downside to the shares that can plague other market segments such as small cap stocks.The term blue chip itself was coined in the 1920s and has stood the test of time. The list of stocks that are typically classified as blue-chip stocks are part of the Dow 30 index, and they include some of the largest companies in the world. When it comes to market capitalization, the largest blue-chip company is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose latest market value sits at $2.76 trillion. At the same time, a high share price or recent share price performance is not a criterion for being included in the list. The best example of this phenomenon comes through the inclusion of the semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).Widely known for having popularized the microprocessor and having kicked off the personal computing race, Intel's shares have not done well recently as the semiconductor industry undergoes a cyclical downturn and the firm struggles to keep its chipmaking lead amidst tough competition from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Intel's shares are relatively flat over the past 12 months and are down by a painful 29% over the past five years as the firm is desperately revamping its technology roadmap and building new facilities to regain investor confidence.At the same time, recent stock price outperformance is not a criterion for inclusion on the list either. If this were the case, then NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have been a sure shot inclusion in the list. NVIDIA's stock is up by a stunning 224% year to date, as the firm is widely believed to profit from the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products. In fact, optimism about the demand for data center products in particular led NVIDIA to guide $11 billion in revenue for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which was significantly higher than the $7.2 billion penned in by analysts. The stock price reflects this optimism, and the share price appreciation appears to have no end in sight. Yet, despite all this optimism, NVIDIA is not part of the Dow 30 index even as analysts believe that it is the market leader by a wide margin when it comes to meeting AI demand. Looking at the year to date gains of the Dow 30, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows that the index has gained 3.72% year to date, indicating that the astute investor would have been far, far better off by having a bet on NVIDIA than the collection of elite stocks which the index represents.Story continuesThe index itself is managed by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and there are no specific quantitative criteria for inclusion. As the firm describes in its methodology:While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S.So, for our list today, we decided to take a look at which blue chip stocks are favored by both hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. If you want to see which blue chip stocks haven't done well this year, then you can check out 15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023.

RMD is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the strength of digital health solutions. The company remains well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally. The company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations. However, escalated expenses and reimbursement headwinds are concerning for ResMed.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 26.2% compared with the 3.9% decline of the industry and a 6.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $24.37 billion. RMD has an earnings yield of 4.29% against the industry’s yield of -2%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, matched the same in one and missed in another quarter. It has an average earnings surprise of 1.64%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong Potential in Digital Health: RMD’s patient-facing digital health platforms continue to witness strong uptake. The adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 tend to be more than double that of the AirSense 10.Simultaneously, progress across several digital health technology initiatives appears promising to further the value proposition for the connected healthcare ecosystem. Over the next several quarters, the company plans to introduce several AI-driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider-facing AirView platform, as well as the patient-facing myAir app.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, ResMed is leading the market in digital health technology with more than 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. The company is increasing investments in this space as it continues to unlock value from those data to benefit patients, providers, physicians and payers.Strategic Pacts to Boost the SaaS Business: ResMed’s SaaS business for out-of-hospital care remains an integral part of the company’s growth strategy. The Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and RMD’s core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond.Story continuesIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, organic revenues across the SaaS business were driven by ongoing strength in the Home Medical Equipment and Infusion segments. The most recent SaaS portfolio addition, MEDIFOX DAN, continues to surpass expectations with another full-quarter contribution.The company is seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market across skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and beyond. This presents opportunities for the business to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies.Strong Solvency With Moderate Payout Load: ResMed exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million and total debt of $1.43 billion. However, at the quarter end, the company's near-term payable debt level remained pretty low at $9.9 compared to the corresponding cash balance. This reflects strength in the company's solvency position despite challenging times.DownsidesMounting Expenses: ResMed missed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The adjusted gross margin declined, reflecting increases in component costs and warranty and manufacturing-related costs, as well as product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales.Incremental SG&amp;A expenses were attributed to increases in employee-related cost marketing and travel expenses and expenses associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. In the quarter, R&amp;D expenses rose 21.5% compared to the last year.Reimbursement Headwind: ResMed's ability to sell its products largely depends on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for its products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of its products.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RMD’s fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has moved down from $7.33 to $7.10 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $4.60 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, SiBone SIBN and Quanterix QTRX.Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 4.29% against the industry’s -2%. Haemonetics’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%. Its shares have risen 6.4% against the industry’s 4.3% decline in the past year.HAE carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.SiBone, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 22.9% compared with the industry’s 16.2%.

Shares of QTRX have risen 106.6% against the industry’s 4.3% decline over the past year.Quanterix’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 30.39%.

The move coming on the heels of a similar downgrade by Moody's two weeks ago. And as a result, borrowing costs could get even higher from here. So here with more, we want to bring in Dick Bove, financial strategist at Odeon Capital Group. Dick, it's great to see you again. So first, just your reaction to this move by S&amp;P. And of course, it follows a similar move by Moody's just two weeks ago.DICK BOVE: Well, I think S&amp;P kind of lost the ball here. They should have done this a few months ago. The banking industry crisis began last March, and it has not been alleviated or eased up in any way, shape, or form since then. And if people didn't believe it, by the time they saw the second quarter earnings of banks, they should have understood very clearly that this industry is undercapitalized at the current time, and that is the source of its problem.Story continues- And, Dick, I want to ask you, to your point, this has kind of been simmering on the back burner for a while now. Is there the potential for systemic risks that we're not seeing right now? Well, I mean, the systemic risk I think you're looking for or wondering about, is there a large amount of loan losses out there somewhere? I guess people are looking at the commercial real estate industry. I don't think so.I think that the issue here is that the Federal Reserve increased interest rates now everybody knows if interest rates go up, the value of financial assets go down. But do they really know that? Because if you take a look at the banking industry, since 93% of their assets are financial in nature, the balance sheets of the banks have gone down a step by step every time the Fed increases interest rates.And a the decline in assets has now been so great, if you subtract it from the equity of these companies. In other words, if assets go from $100 to $80, you've got to take that $20 off of equity. You find that most banks in the United States are struggling to maintain their common equity to asset ratios if you use fair value accounting, which of course, the banks don't use.Specific example, Bank of America. They've got a securities portfolio called held to maturity. They show that security portfolio on their balance sheet at x number of dollars. If they fair value that balance sheet, those securities, they would have showed that they've overstated the number by $109 billion.If you take a look at their home mortgage portfolio, the yield on that home mortgage portfolio is 3.40%. And it's about a $265 billion portfolio. That's not worth par value. It's worth substantially below par value. But Bank of America doesn't show what the true value of that mortgage portfolio is.Now I don't want to pick on Bank of America solely because that's true of the banking industry overall. Now if you're a regulator, you're taking a look at the numbers which are coming in from these banks. And you're saying, my goodness. They don't have equity, or that the equity ratios are nowhere near what they should be.So the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency get together and they issue this 1,083-page report, which is out for comment at the moment. And the bottom line of that report is, hey, guys. You're going to have to put more equity in your company because on a fair value basis, the equity is just not there.Now why should people go out and buy stocks in companies where the balance sheet that you see, , that you get in your mailbox is not the true balance sheet of the company? They don't do it, and they won't do it because banks are simply not stating what the true value of their equity, what the true value of their assets are, what the true value of their equity is.SEANA SMITH: So then, Dick, given all that, the fact that obviously, like you just said, regulators proposing higher capital requirements for banks the $100 billion or more in assets, and then you take into account this higher for longer environment, that it sounds like we are going to be in for quite some time. How much worse could it potentially get then for banks?DICK BOVE: Well, I think, for an earnings standpoint, I don't believe that you're going to see reasonable earnings coming out of these banks for the next two quarters. I think in the first quarter, when the comment period is over for this 1,083-page document, you will see that the Fed will move-- or these three agencies will move with alacrity to basically force these banks to increase their equity.Now, the banks have two options because they know what I'm telling you very, very clearly. So they have two options. Do they go out, increase the rate that they pay on deposits, bring in more deposits, take that money, make more loans? Or do they say, this is crazy. We're going to shrink our balance sheet. We're going to get rid of loans. We're not going to make as many loans. We're not going to fight hard to get those deposits. And when we shrink our balance sheet, the Fed will not come after us to increase the amount of equity that we should have in the institution.So now, you have to stop and think, well, what does that mean for the economy if the banks pull back in lending, which I'll guarantee you they're going to do? You can take a look at Truist, or US Bank, or Comerica, or Regions Financial, a number of other banks which are already in process of doing that, Fifth Third, that specifically stated it publicly. If the banks are going to pull back from lending, who's going to lend money to the economy? Remember, the banks have $23 trillion in assets. If they pull back, someone has to replace them. Who is that going to be? It's going to be non-bank companies.- So, Dick, I want to ask you. So when you're thinking about this kind of persistent inflation, it's really a double edged sword when it comes to the banks. It's great in terms of earnings, right? But it also has kind of a negative side. So who is your pick when you're kind of balancing out this level of persistent inflation that we have in this high interest rate environment?DICK BOVE: Well, I'll give you some names of companies that I like because they're well managed banks. But I don't think that the stock prices of those companies are going to run up tomorrow or maybe over the next six months. But I like Citigroup here because I think that if you take a look at the balance sheet of Citigroup, essentially what you see is the market cap of Citigroup is only 25% of the cash on Citigroup's balance sheet. You have to say, how can that happen?In other words, the Citigroup is selling at 41% of its book value, but its book value is even well below the cash in the bank. So I think from a structural standpoint, the Citigroup has been oversold. I like Fifth Third because I think that the management there has a very clear view of what is going on in the economy. I think that they have structured their balance sheet to take most of the impact from the increase in interest rates. And that's already been worked into the balance sheet.If bank stocks are going to go up, JP Morgan is going to go up. If bank stocks don't go up, JP Morgan may still go up. Remember, banking companies, if you take a look at the prices of these companies today, and we look at the prices of 105 of them, almost 90% of them are down in price over the past five years. In other words, bank stocks have continually dropped.And the reason that they've dropped is because of mismanagement of capital. These banks that I just mentioned in this five-year period bought back $400 billion in stock. That is the most obscene thing that they could have ever done because that $400 billion did not buy them any increase in stock price. The stock prices are all down.What did they do, what it did was they basically took $400 billion off their balance sheet, and that lost 1% of their earnings. But if they kept it on their balance sheet and they leveraged it 11 to 1, which they leveraged their equity at, that's $4.4 trillion that could have been working for banks at the present time that isn't there because they decided to go to the top of their buildings and throw cash off the top of the building.So the net effect is, they're to blame for a good portion of the reason as to why these stocks are doing so poorly at the present time. Managements need to be changed. Boards of directors need to be changed. They can't do things like that.SEANA SMITH: Well, Dick Bove, it's always great to get your perspective. You'd have to join us again more, so we can get maybe some of the companies that you are going to continue to avoid within the space given all those challenges. Dick Bove of Odeon Capital Group. Thanks so much.DICK BOVE: Thank you.]"

With shares currently priced at $429.23, Ulta Beauty Inc has witnessed a decline of 4.17% over a period, marked against a three-month change of -10.9%. A thorough analysis, underlined by the GuruFocus Score Rating, suggests that Ulta Beauty Inc is well-positioned for substantial growth in the near future.ULTA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ULTAUlta Beauty Inc: A Deep Dive into Financial Metrics and Competitive StrengthsWhat Is the GF Score?The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Ulta Beauty Inc's GF Score components are as follows:1. Financial strength rank: 6/102. Profitability rank: 10/103. Growth rank: 10/104. GF Value rank: 7/105. Momentum rank: 8/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score. With a high profitability rank and a slightly lower financial strength rank, GuruFocus assigned Ulta Beauty Inc the GF Score of 97 out of 100, which signals the highest outperformance potential.Understanding Ulta Beauty Inc BusinessUlta Beauty Inc, with a market cap of $21.38 billion and sales of $10.50 billion, is the largest specialized beauty retailer in the U.S. The firm offers makeup, fragrances, skin care, and hair care products, and bath and body items.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.64 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 9.4%.On a non-GAAP basis, Intuit anticipates earnings per share in the range of $1.43-$1.48. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.38 per share, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 25.5%.Intuit’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.8%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIntuit Inc. price-eps-surprise | Intuit Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe gradual recovery in Small Business and Self-Employed is expected to have contributed to the top line in the quarter under review. Our estimate for Small Business and Self-Employed’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.1 billion. In the last quarter, the business unit grew 21%, driven by solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online, a favorable mix shift and the addition of Mailchimp.Intuit’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues are likely to have witnessed solid growth in the Online Ecosystem, driven by an expanding subscriber base for Quickbooks Online and ARPC. Our estimate for total Online Ecosystem’s revenues is pegged at $1.54 billion for the quarter under review, indicating a 20.7% rise from the prior year's reported figure.Our estimate for Quickbooks Online’s revenues is pegged at $778.1 million, suggesting an 18.4% year-over-year improvement. The Online Ecosystem is likely to have boosted overall sales in the fourth quarter.The solid momentum of INTU’s leading product, QuickBooks Capital, and improving customer retention rates are anticipated to have acted as tailwinds in the fiscal fourth quarter.However, due to the ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Intuit’s business partners have been pulling back from extending their credit, risking credit performance deterioration in the near term. This is expected to have led to lower Credit Karma revenues in the quarter to be reported. The business unit contributed $410 million to INTU’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenues. Our estimate for Credit Karma’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $390 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 17.9%.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Intuit this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both Haemonetics and Stryker are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HAE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.87, while SYK has a forward P/E of 26.64.

SYK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.69.Another notable valuation metric for HAE is its P/B ratio of 5. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for DaVita HealthCare basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For DaVita HealthCare, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for DaVita HealthCareFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this kidney dialysis provider is expected to earn $7.22 per share, which is a change of 9.4% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for DaVita HealthCare. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of DaVita HealthCare to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

HQY has been gaining from its unique investment platform. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, data security issues and a tough competitive landscape are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 15.2% against the 14.2% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 6.9% growth in the said time frame.The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $5.97 billion. The company projects 22% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 9.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Unique Investment Platform: We are optimistic about HealthEquity’s multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health-saving and spending decisions and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services HealthEquity provides as well as services provided by third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity’s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance.Strength in HSA: HealthEquity’s total number of HSAs, as of Apr 30, 2023, rose 9.3% year over year. HealthEquity reported 556,000 HSAs with investments as of Apr 30, 2023, up 9.9% year over year. Total Accounts, as of Apr 30, 2023, were up 3.8% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.9 million other consumer-directed benefits (CDBs). Total HSA assets were up 10.1% year over year at the end of Apr 30, 2023.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: HealthEquity saw solid top-line and bottom-line performances in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. The expansion of both margins was also seen.DownsidesStiff Competition: HealthEquity faces stiff competition in the Medical Services market, which is rapidly evolving and fragmented. The company’s success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, and its ability to increase engagement and demonstrate the value of its services to existing and potential clients, Network Partners and members.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 9.7% north to $1.92.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $238.8 million, suggesting a 15.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

In addition to raising their biological children, they also decided to adopt four children with special needs.The house where the family lives is generally adapted to their needs. For example, in 2017, Habitat for Humanity Poland helped the family by paving the path around the garden so that wheelchair users could also use it. But after 6 years the premises needed to be refreshed: the garden became overgrown, and the paved walkway became impassable for a wheelchair. In addition, the rear entrance to the property was not usable, due to the family's inability to keep it in good order, and at some point they no longer had the strength to bring it up to proper condition.Whirlpool volunteers from all over Poland took part to support this family in Wierzbice. On July 3 and 4, over 20 volunteers, from Radomsko, Wrocław, Łódź and Warsaw, representing all polish locations of Whirlpool Corporation, helped repaint the whole house inside and do all the garden work. Employees worked through intense heat and other challenges and were able to see how different problems people have, what they face on a daily basis, and how life's priorities change when caring for orphaned, disabled children.As a result of these two days of work, the team was able to update the house inside, clean it, repaint the rooms and deal with places that were inaccessible to the hosts, in addition to bringing the garden up to scratch, giving the family a lot of pleasant space to enjoy throughout the summer. The family returned the favor with sincere thanks, smiles and a delicious fresh yeast cake with garden strawberries, making everyone feel at home.""Our action aroused great interest. It exceeded our expectations. We had a huge number of applications from our employees wanting to take part in the action. Therefore, we increased the originally assumed number of volunteers. Already on the spot, our colleagues confirmed great commitment and willingness to help.

At its current price of $71.03 per share, Sempra Energy has a market cap of $44.70 billion and the stock shows every sign of being modestly undervalued.Story continuesBecause Sempra Energy is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Is Sempra Energy (SRE) Modestly Undervalued?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of Sempra EnergyIt is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock.

The overall financial strength of Sempra Energy is 4 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Sempra Energy is poor.Is Sempra Energy (SRE) Modestly Undervalued?Profitability and Growth of Sempra EnergyInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Sempra Energy's ROIC was 2.9, while its WACC came in at 5.92.Is Sempra Energy (SRE) Modestly Undervalued?ConclusionIn short, the stock of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) shows every sign of being modestly undervalued.

Let’s take a closer look.Palo Alto NetworksMany feared Palo Alto Networks’ results would come in lighter than expected due to a late Friday report. However, there wasn’t much to fear, as the cybersecurity titan exceeded earnings expectations by more than 12%, sending shares soaring post-earnings.In fact, PANW shares have been regularly boosted by quarterly results in 2023, as we can see illustrated below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s remaining performance obligation improved by an impressive 30% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, with quarterly billings also seeing a solid 18% improvement from the comparable period last year. PANW shares aren’t cheap, with the current 48.6X forward earnings multiple (F1) undoubtedly on the higher end of the spectrum. Still, the company’s rapid growth makes the premium easier to understand.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCelsius HoldingsCelsius has consistently posted robust results lately, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by at least 80% across its last three quarters. CELH posted a 100% EPS surprise in its latest release and reported revenue 15% ahead of expectations.There was much to like in the latest print, with CELH’s gross profit improving 168% year-over-year to $59 million thanks to lower raw material costs and freight efficiencies. In addition, the company exited the quarter with $681 million in cash and equivalents, well above the year-ago figure of $60 million.Story continuesAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations in a big way across the board following the release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, Q2 revenue of $326 million reflected a quarterly record. And the growth is slated to continue, with expectations for its current year suggesting 170% earnings growth on nearly 90% higher revenues.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral ElectricGeneral Electric’s report impressed the market, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 48% and delivering a 5% revenue beat.In addition, General Electric upped its guidance; GE expects FY23 adjusted EPS of $2.10 – $2.30, up from the previous $1.70 – $2.00 per share expected. Further, General Electric forecasted FY23 free cash flow in a bracket of $4.1 – $4.6 billion (previously $3.6 billion – $4.2 billion).Analysts raised their expectations across multiple timeframes following the release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company is expected to see a growth slowdown in its current year, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.27 suggesting a 13% pullback in the bottom line.

The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite gained 6.9%.A niche focus, improved pricing, effective risk management, strategic buyouts and solid capital position should continue to drive this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.Markel, with a market capitalization of $19.5 billion, has a decent history of delivering positive surprises. It beat estimates in three of the last four reported quarters, while missing in one.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan the Stock Retain the Momentum?Earnings of this insurer increased 29% in the last five years, outperforming the industry average of 10.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $83.32 per share, implying an increase of 22.9% from the year-ago reported figure on 10.2% higher revenues of $14.6 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $93.16, implying an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago reported figure on 8.8% higher revenues of $15.9 billion.MKL’s gross premiums increased at a two-year CAGR of 19.4%. New business volume, strong policy retention levels, continued increases in rates and expanded product offerings should help MKL continue to deliver better premiums.Markel aims to double the size of its insurance operations and thus targets $10 billion of annual insurance premiums in five years. This should lead to $1 billion of annual underwriting profit. MKL expects to achieve this goal primarily through organic growth of its existing operations. We estimate operating revenues to witness a three-year CAGR of (2022-2025) 13.4%.Investment income has been rising over the past many years. A better interest rate is likely to boost investment results. Markel expects to benefit gradually from higher interest rates within its fixed maturity portfolio through recent purchases at higher yield rates. It believes the impact to become more meaningful in the future as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. We estimate a 42.7% increase in net investment income in 2023.Through Markel Ventures, MKL has been investing in the ownership of the best asset management firms. The insurer has been pursuing acquisitions to achieve profitable growth in insurance operations and to create additional value on a diversified basis in Markel Ventures operations.Markel has a solid capital position that supports the insurer in engaging in share buybacks on the strength of its solid capital position.Story continuesAttractive ValuationThe company’s shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 16.5, lower than the industry average of 19.8.

354,c8f5eff1-4892-3218-9168-58a1ff7493c4,UNH,2023-08-23,30 Countries with Longest Life Expectancy in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-longest-life-expectancy-112848550.html,1692790128,STORY,"['UNH', 'MCK', 'CVS']","[This article covers 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023, with insight into current life expectancy trends, the healthcare industry, and how life expectancies vary across different regions. For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023. Life expectancy is a significant factor that helps determine the overall well-being and health of the people in a country. Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on age-specific death rates.  Life expectancy trends throughout the globe are readily changing, even in the countries with the longest life expectancy, as recorded by various studies. As per data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been significant progress in the life expectancy of people across the globe in the past few decades. From an average of 43.5 years recorded in 1950, it has increased to 72.6 years in 2023. This improvement can be a result of advancements in public health measures, medical science, and nutrition. The Current State of the Healthcare IndustryIn 2021, the global healthcare industry was valued at around $104.44 billion and is projected to increase to a figure of $272.76 billion by the end of 2027. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 20% in the designated period.  As of now, there are many well-known names in the healthcare market, such as CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and McKesson Corp.(NYSE:MCK) to name a few, all with revenues in billions of dollars.  Where contributions to the field and new medical discoveries are concerned, CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) focuses on the physical and emotional well-being of the patients, whereas UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) offers insurance and consulting services. Meanwhile, McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) has expanded its services in the US, Canada, as well as Europe.  Unsurprisingly, all three companies have a market capitalization of billions, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) leading the charge with $486.6 billion, followed by CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) at $124.8 billion and McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) coming with $53.3 billion.  With the rising market capitalization and revenues of healthcare companies, it stands to reason that countries are moving towards efficient and advanced solutions and people are becoming more health-conscious.  Governments are also playing their roles in improving life expectancy. Since seniors are the most at risk when it comes to health concerns, governments in different countries are increasing healthcare expenditures for them. The US is one such example, which spends 2.4 times more on the elderly, as compared to the younger population. Moreover, healthcare systems are directly linked to an increase in life expectancy across the globe. In a study conducted, researchers concluded that if healthcare is made available to the population as a whole, it could extend the longevity of life. This is also an indicator of the improved life expectancy in countries with advanced healthcare solutions and systems. Story continuesThe Role of AI in the Healthcare IndustryDue to advancements in technology, artificial intelligence (AI) is readily implemented in numerous fields, with healthcare being no exception. As of now, the global AI market is believed to grow significantly. In 2020, AI in the healthcare industry was around $14 billion and has been projected to reach up to $119 billion before 2028.  AI has also made substantial progress in the field of anti-aging drugs, which can effectively eliminate senescent cells. These are faulty cells that are a result of various conditions, like Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. In this year alone, Harvard Medical School was able to successfully develop chemical cocktails, which contain various agents that help with treating mental and physical disorders. After extensive successful testing on monkeys and mice, the experts believe that they will soon be able to revive human cells and reverse cellular aging. With the rise in AI healthcare and machine learning (ML) applications in the industry, healthcare can aid in further improving life expectancy. This could especially have a hold in countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, China, and the US, which are leading the market in AI.  Thus, it stands to reason that life expectancy in these countries is higher than most, and why they are not on the list of the 30 Countries with the Lowest Life Expectancy 2023. MethodologyFor our list of 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023, we used two core metrics to support the study: Life expectancy by country of both sexes and infant mortality rate per 1,000 births. The reports used to ascertain the primary metrics include the Life Expectancy of the World Population Index by Worldometers and the Infant Mortality Index by CIA.gov.  The reason we chose two metrics is that life expectancy is primarily used to offer a holistic overview of the health of the population. Meanwhile, infant mortality focuses on the relevant health risks that are specific to the younger population. Together, these two indexes offer a distinct perspective on the overall well-being and survival rate of the people of the country. We first assigned countries on each indicator a score of 1-30 (1 indicating the best rank and 30 the lowest on our list), to standardize our evaluation. To combine these metrics into a single ranking, we calculated the weighted averages of both metrics, while assigning a weight of 0.5 to each indicator. Finally, we ranked countries in descending order from 30-1 based on composite results, with 30 indicating the country with the shortest life expectancy and 1 indicating the country with the longest life expectancy on our list.  Below is our complete list of 30 Countries with the Longest Life Expectancy in 2023.Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy in 202330.

358,c80cb91e-7c6d-3afa-af13-4f4474abc5e9,UNH,2023-08-23,Health care stocks: What the market technicals show,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/health-care-stocks-market-technicals-172458395.html,1692725098,VIDEO,"['XLV', 'MRK', 'UNH', 'AMGN', 'JNJ']","[Why are UnitedHealth (UNH), Merck &amp; Company (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Amgen (AMGN), this strategist's top health care stock picks? Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss and break down the market technicals of health care stocks.Woods says he focuses on those four health care stocks, ""because they're in Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I give you health care.""The Health Care Select Sector (XLV) ""continues to make higher lows, as it goes along,"" Woods notes. ""If you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety sector,"" Woods says.Video Transcript- I know you have some picks in health care. Surprisingly, Pfizer not making your cut, though, Jay. So walk us through your base case. You've got UnitedHealth, Merck, J&amp;J, and Amgen, but not Pfizer.JAY WOODS: Well, I definitely don't have Pfizer. Pfizer has been a dog in the sector. And I focused on those four stocks. Why? Because they're in a Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you're looking for reasons why the Dow can rally, I'll give you health care. The health care sector continues to make high or lows as it goes along.- There's health care.JAY WOODS: All right, so what do we see here? We see nice continued high or lows. Every time it sells off, it continues to get a little higher and it's consolidating in here.- Jay, I want to stop you for a second. Here's a 10-year chart, and I'm going to put some candlesticks back on. This is like-- I would call this a rare diamond formation. This is just consolidation in terms of a long-term secular trend, it looks like.JAY WOODS: Well, the diamond formation could be a negative. This is a debate in the technical analysis community, because sometimes this is a key reversal where you see come down. I, however, yes, I do see the diamond, but the way the underlying stocks, the stocks within the index, the UNHs of the world, which is the biggest component of the Dow because the Dow--Story continues- Look at UnitedHealth, very similar chart to XLV. This is 10 years, but I'm going to dial this down to a year to date and we can switch that as well.JAY WOODS: Yeah, UnitedHealthcare has been consolidating. It tested the 450 area here twice. And if you go back further in time, it's tested it several times. So we have a nice double bottom. It rallied above it. It's now above its 200 day moving average, and it can still run another 50 points and still be in this consolidation zone that we've seen. 50 points in UNH is another 300 Dow points. I think that's what we're going to see from it over the near term. And if you're a little skittish on the overall market, health care is a safety-- safety sector. So I think it's going to see some action.- Two more. We got Merck and Amgen. I don't know if we have time for both, but start with Merck.JAY WOODS: Let's focus on Merck because Merck is playing out seasonally just like it had last year. We had some consolidating periods where we've seen drop offs. And what has it done? It's rallied year in. The stock is flat year to date. Over the last 12 months, it's up about 25%. But year to date, it's flat.If people are looking for performance, if they're looking for something strong within the sector, it's not only in the Dow. It's a major impact on the XLV and the stock should rally into year end based on what we've seen before. And the fact that it's still making higher lows, I'm not very good at drawing with my finger, obviously, but it looks like in this consolidation period above 105, I still like Merck, and I think it's still bullish.- All right, Rochelle, any more?- Well, I was going to say, for people who are perhaps not familiar with some of the terms like diamond formation, what is the best way for them to sort of view some of the changes that they're seeing here?- Love it. Trader education.JAY WOODS: Trader education, risk management obviously number one-- rule number one, number two, number three when trading. When you get into the trade, you want to have levels. If this doesn't work out, like I just said in Merck, 105 something has changed to me. And I will take that loss, I will limit that loss.The formations are fun to follow, but I look for continuation patterns, and I'm seeing setups that can show continuation to the upside. So the risk reward set up to me in these stocks and in the sector is definitely bullish.- Jay, we got to go. Really appreciate you. Anybody who wants to learn about trading, also follow Jay Woods on Twitter, your handle.JAY WOODS: @ JayWoods3.- There you go. Rochelle.]"

The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals.Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched. Mounjaro sales are already benefiting from strong demand trends. However, the CRL for donanemab will probably delay the potential launch of the candidate.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets are some top-line headwinds.

The Government business remains well-poised for growth.

The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services.Increased market share in grocery continued to boost U.S. comp sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Strong comp sales growth globally, expense leverage and e-commerce growth across all units were upsides.Although Walmart raised its guidance for fiscal 2024, its adjusted earnings per share view suggests a decline from the year-ago period figure. The company is battling cost inflation, which is likely to remain elevated. An adverse product mix has also been a downside for margins.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Applied Materials, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of changing stock market dynamics today, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 5 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.""Routine August Pullback Or The Start Of A Meaningful Move Lower?""In the months leading up to August 2023, the stock market was seeing a prolonged rally. The valuations of many stocks got stretched during the first half of the year and were brought down as soon as August hit. According to a CNBC report from August 18, Cameron Dawson, the Chief Investment Officer at NewEdge Wealth, had the following to say on this matter:""I do think that corrections are very normal in even the best of bear markets, and we usually see them in the high single digits to low teens, that's all run of the mill, and what we were seeing into July is that you had a lot of position chasing, you had the dynamic of it all being valuation-driven, there was really no change in the earnings outlook, even after a great earnings season. And so it did appear that there was this 'feeding on itself' mentality that was leading to the upside, so no wonder you're seeing the air come out of stocks that went up the most.""Based on how market trends have been developing since the start of August, Adam Parker from Trivariate Research chimed in with the following take on the market:""I'm probably more bullish now than I was a month ago. I mean the market's down five and the earnings are higher - 2024 and 2023 earnings are up a little bit. So if I'm trying to be, you know, intellectually honest, I guess I should like it a little bit more than I did a month ago. I mean, earnings season I thought was pretty good, the big-cap tech stocks generally delivered.""Despite Parker's generally bullish outlook on the market, it was noted that the markets are seeing some pullback in several areas. One reason put forward for this development in August was seasonality. CNBC showed a seasonal history chart of the S&amp;P 500's performance dating from 1983 to 2023 to drive home the point that the benchmark index generally tends to experience a pullback around August. According to Dawson, though, seasonality is just one of several factors investment professionals need to take into account when mapping out the progress of the market to try and figure out why a pullback happens.Story continues""People Are Just Putting Money Elsewhere""Another August 18 CNBC report showed how the August pullback was not just restricted to stocks, with bonds and crypto also becoming part of the larger downhill trend witnessed in the markets. Here's what Victoria Fernandez, the Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, had to say about this:""I think you have to look at people's cash positions right now and look at their short term treasury allocations. I think that's where we're seeing a lot of this cash go. They're getting good yields by just keeping their money in cash, so why take the risk of having it in some tech names that are down 10-11% a month, having it in bonds where 10-year yields have gone up about 50 basis points over the last couple of weeks? So short term elements right now I think is where most people are hiding their money, waiting for an opportunity to get back in this market.""Sarah Kunst, the Managing Director at Cleo Capital, agreed with Fernandez's take on investment moves people are taking at this point, considering the way sectors like technology are currently performing in the market. Despite the August stock selloff, though, many sectors are continuing to hold on. A Reuters article from August 19 mentioned that defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities are continuing to rise even in August. The S&amp;P 500 energy index has also posted small gains, and the tech sector is brushing off the fall because of some rallying stocks.In each sector, the market-leading demeanor of companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) may help many sectors retain a significant portion of their gains even after the August selloff.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Investing in cheap stocks is like finding a great deal at a store – it's about picking stocks that might be undervalued right now but have the potential to be worth more in the future. Instead of going after the popular or flashy choices, value investors look for hidden gems that others might have missed. So, value investing can be a viable strategy for long-term investors, but its effectiveness depends on market conditions, individual goals, risk tolerance, and one's ability to select undervalued stocks. In rolling periods of 15 years between 1927 and 2019, value investing did better than growth investing over 90% of the time, according to finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French.Value investing is often discussed in contrast to growth investing. Both investment strategies have experienced periods of both outperformance and underperformance at different times in history. According to a study published by Goldman Sachs, value investing has generally done well in the past, especially from 1970 to early 2007. But then, from around mid-2007 until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, growth investing was more successful. After the pandemic, value investing began to perform better again. The report also mentioned that value investing tends to do better when there's high inflation, the economy is growing strongly, and interest rates are high. From the time after World War II until the 1970s, interest rates kept rising in response to ever-higher inflation, leading to a period of clear Value dominance.Also read: 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsJawad Mian, a founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections, spoke about value investing in his interview with Wall Street Journal in June this year. He said that value beat growth because it focused a lot on sectors like energy, materials, and financials, which were very important for the U.S. economy after the Great Depression. But now, the economy is mostly driven by technology, which is making the growth part of the market perform well.Story continuesValue stocks often come from well-established companies that have a history of making steady profits and paying dividends. Investors who are looking for long-term investments and want a steady income can gain from the dividends that value stocks offer. Some popular companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have been increasing their dividends for many years. These companies also have strong financial positions, indicating that their dividends could keep growing.

365,acd16d79-d8fa-31f8-938c-3868f505a402,MAC,2023-08-23,Macerich (MAC) Inks Leases for 2.4MSF YTD on Solid Demand,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macerich-mac-inks-leases-2-171500874.html,1692724500,STORY,['MAC'],"[With robust retail demand and muted new supply continuing to drive the recovery in the retail real estate industry, The Macerich Company’s MAC portfolio of premium assets in the vibrant markets of the United States is experiencing robust leasing activity, leading to occupancy gains.Retailers are renting out more physical store spaces to meet this demand. This has also helped the company backfill its spaces, which is encouraging.Notably, during the second quarter of 2023, Macerich signed 191 leases encompassing 1.4 million square feet. On a comparable center basis, this reflected a 21% increase in square footage signed year over year.This brings the company’s year-to-date leasing volume to 2.4 million square feet, a record. The same indicates a 34% increase in square footage signed from the prior-year period.Moreover, solid demand has boosted occupancy levels at the company’s shopping centers. As of Jun 30, 2023, portfolio occupancy was 92.6%, up 40 basis points (bps) sequentially and 80 bps year over year. Consequently, MAC’s re-leasing spreads almost doubled quarter over quarter to 11.3%.  In addition, the company’s focus on the reuse and mixed-use of its properties through the recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants has paid off well.The company opened 263,000 square feet of new stores in the second quarter of 2023, a rise of 20% in terms of square footage compared with the second quarter of 2022. These included Apple and Kendra Scott at Tysons Corner Center, Primark at Green Acres Mall, Target and Ashley HomeStore at Kings Plaza, and Louis Vuitton, Allbirds and Alo Yoga at Broadway Plaza, to name a few.Per Doug Healey, senior executive vice president, Leasing, Macerich, “Macerich’s top-quality Regional Town Centers continue to mean more things to more people, thanks to the wide variety of categories and uses we successfully attract. In addition to apparel and accessories retailers, these categories now include health and fitness, food and beverage, entertainment, sports, hotels, multifamily residences and more – at interest levels we have never seen before.”Macerich’s encouraging leasing pipeline of new store openings is expected to fuel its rental income growth in the upcoming years, poising it well to ride the growth curve. Specifically, it expects to realize around $66 million of incremental rent in the aggregate over 2023, 2024 and 2025 and be accretive to its net operating income and cash flow.Further, the company expects to continue approving new deals and sign new leases in the upcoming period, especially with those in large formats, aiming to boost traffic and sales at its Regional Town Centers.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 16.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.7%.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest rate environment remain key concerns for the company.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Saul Centers, Inc.

366,acc85941-90b1-311d-9f39-8658d681bb0e,DHI,2023-08-23,Is MDC a Profitable Pick Amid High-Interest Rate Environment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdc-profitable-pick-amid-high-173100487.html,1692725460,STORY,"['DHI', 'MDC', 'KBH', 'LEN-B']","[M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC has been rallying this year, thanks to improving demand trends and a lack of housing supply.The stock grew 45.3% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 39.8% growth.Reduced supply chain issues and reduced cycle times are also likely to aid the homebuilding industry in the near term.However, a more than 7% 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, elevated construction and financing costs and a lack of skilled labor are major concerns.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMDC and its peers like KB Home KBH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and Lennar Corporation LEN have undertaken various price actions as well as cost-saving moves that will certainly add to the bliss.MDC currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with an impressive VGM Score of A. This helps identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.What Makes MDC A Profitable Pick?Built-to-Order Process Bode Well: The company’s Build-to-Order process, also known as “dirt sales,” provides buyers with a wide range of choices in major aspects of their future home and a personalized customer experience through in-house community teams. This highly consumer-centric approach helps homebuyers design a home with the features and amenities of their choice, with the flexibility to customize their options according to their preferences and affordability.The company limits the number of homes started without a contract, also known as “spec homes” and follows a strategy of initiating construction only after a purchase agreement has been executed. This reduces inventory risk, enhances efficiencies in construction and provides greater visibility as well as predictability for future deliveries. MDC’s build-to-order homes model gives it a competitive edge over its peers.Focus on Affordability: MDC remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. In view of these strategic efforts, the growing share of first-time buyers is encouraging, especially post-pandemic.Improving Housing Trends: The Housing market has shown signs of recovery of late. This is reflected in the company’s order pattern. Net new orders grew 54.3% year over year to 2,167 units in the second quarter. This was driven by an increase in the monthly sales absorption pace, which was backed by the high pace of gross orders as well as a decrease in cancellation rates. Cancellations, as a percentage of gross sales, decreased year over year to 20.2% from 37.2%. The monthly absorption rate also increased by 34% year over year.The value of net orders increased 36.8% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $1.21 billion, backed by the increase in net new orders. The uptrend in the new home market is driven by reduced existing home supply.Story continuesA Brief Discussion of the Above-Mentioned StocksD.R. Horton now expects consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $34.7-$35.1 billion, up from the prior expectation of $31.5-$33 billion. DHI reported $33.5 billion in revenues in fiscal 2022. Homes closed are anticipated within 82,800-83,300 units versus 77,000-80,000 units expected earlier.For the Rental business, the company expects homes closed within 6,500-7,000 units versus prior guidance of 4,000-5,000 units. Fiscal 2023 cash flow from homebuilding operations on a consolidated basis is expected to be more than $3 billion.DHI’s fiscal 2023 earnings per share have increased to $13.07 per share from $11.28 over the past 30 days, respectively. It carries an impressive VGM Score of A. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVR’s new orders grew 26.6% in the second quarter of 2023 from the year-ago quarter and cancellation rates declined to 11% from 14% a year ago. The shortage of existing homes for sale in the market has been driving demand for new homes despite rate-hike challenges. Also, a high ROE and a solid liquidity position add to the tailwinds.NVR presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

367,7e669e64-a687-3bd6-803f-e555329a1f4c,DHI,2023-08-23,Here's Why Lennar (LEN) is in Warren Buffett's Bucket List,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-lennar-len-warren-172600792.html,1692725160,STORY,"['LEN', 'LEN-B', 'BRK-B', 'DHI']","[Despite the recent hike in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, elevated construction and financing costs and a lack of skilled labor, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) — Warren Buffett — recently invested $814 million in three leading U.S. homebuilders, which include Lennar Corporation LEN, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and NVR, Inc. NVR.A lack of existing inventory and solid demand for housing has been driving the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry. Homebuilding is one of the classic early-stage cyclical industries to emerge from an anticipated recession. A nationwide shortfall of approximately 1.5 million housing units substantiates this position.Lennar, one of the top homebuilders in the United States, also has an optimistic view for the second half of fiscal 2023. Although its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results were down for major metrics due to difficult year-over-year comparisons, the company expects solid third-quarter and fiscal 2023 deliveries and orders.Lennar shares have declined 9% in a month compared with the industry's 7.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s check the factors supporting this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s growth potential.Impressive Q3 &amp; FY’23 Guidance Supports Buffett’s Solid PickFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, Lennar expects deliveries within 17,750-18,250 homes compared with 17,248 units reported a year ago. New orders are likely to be between 18,000 and 19,000 units (significantly up from 14,366 units posted a year ago) and the average selling price is expected to be similar to the fiscal second quarter.Financial Services’ operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $100-$105 million, up from $63 million generated in the prior-year period.For fiscal 2023, Lennar projects deliveries between 68,000 and 70,000 (versus 62,000 and 66,000 homes expected earlier). The new projection is strong compared with the previous year’s reading of 66,399 homes.Story continuesFactors Supporting Lennar’s Growth ProspectLennar has undertaken various price actions and cost-saving moves that are helping it mitigate macroeconomic woes. Also, digital marketing platforms, a land-lighter strategy and a dynamic pricing model bode well. Strong liquidity positions Lennar well for the future.LEN has adopted a price-to-market strategy, which means the company is continuously searching for a market-clearing price for each of its homes on a community-by-community basis.The company has increasingly integrated its marketing strategy via digital channels. It strategically invests in companies involved in technology initiatives that enhance the homebuying experience, reduce SG&amp;A expenses and boost innovation. A dynamic pricing model, along with an improving digital marketing platform, is expected to drive sales volume and maintain consistent production levels.LEN is mainly focused on becoming a pure-play homebuilder and a financial services company. To this end, it plans to spin off all or parts of non-core businesses and create a joint venture to provide single-family homes for rent. The company will now be an asset-light asset management business with a limited balance sheet.A Look at DHI &amp; NVR’s Growth PotentialDHI now expects consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $34.7-$35.1 billion, up from the prior expectation of $31.5-$33 billion. DHI reported $33.5 billion in revenues in fiscal 2022. Homes closed are anticipated within 82,800-83,300 units versus 77,000-80,000 units expected earlier.For the Rental business, the company expects homes closed within 6,500-7,000 units versus prior guidance of 4,000-5,000 units. Fiscal 2023 cash flow from homebuilding operations on a consolidated basis is expected to be more than $3 billion.DHI’s fiscal 2023 earnings per share have increased to $13.07 per share from $11.28 over the past 30 days. It carries an impressive VGM Score of A. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVR’s new orders grew 26.6% in the second quarter of 2023 from the year-ago quarter and cancellation rates declined to 11% from 14% a year ago. The shortage of existing homes for sale in the market has been driving demand for new homes despite rate-hike challenges. Also, a high ROE and a solid liquidity position add to the tailwinds.NVR presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has been revised upward to $440.88 per share from $408.99 over the past 30 days.About Berkshire HathawayBRK.B is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates financial flexibility.Berkshire presently has a Zacks Rank #3.

In the entire exercise, 95% pilots participated with 72.7% casting their votes in favor of the deal. Voting on the issue had been in progress since Aug 7.The approval makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life. In fact, improvements pertaining to quality of life represent nearly 20% of the increased value of the new contract.The approval implies that company contributions to retirement plans will increase. The four-year contract boosts the overall compensation of AAL pilots by more than 46% over its duration, is valued at $9.6 billion. The contract becomes amendable on Aug 1, 2027 and includes a provision that the next round of bargaining can begin as soon as November 2026.Expressing delight on the development, the union’s president Ed Sicher said, “This contract is a big first step toward restoring the wages, benefits, and work rules that were lost during the past two decades while our profession was under continuous assault.""  AAL’s CEO Robert Isom believes that the approval allows AAL to expand its pilot training and provide pilots with more opportunities pertaining to their career advancement.The approval at AAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has not come without hurdles.

376,b1111192-7c26-34a3-878a-3438a6171414,PFG,2023-08-23,Kimberly Etchings: When Risks Lead to Wins,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kimberly-etchings-risks-lead-wins-134500545.html,1692711900,STORY,['PFG'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 22, 2023 / Principal Financial GroupOriginally published on principal.comKimberly Etchings has never been afraid to take risks.From finding her own way to attend a college she'd never visited across the country, to building her own financial advising firm, to taking two years off to reevaluate her career, Etchings has never led with fear. And so far, it's led her to success.""I can look back and say, yes, every time that I've either paused or took a risk, it has proven to be the right decision,"" Etchings says.It's this risk-taking confidence that landed her a regional managing director role-leading an effort to build a financial advisor network from the ground up-at Principal® nearly 10 years ago. And what drove her to rise in the ranks to a national vice president with the company just six years later.Starting from scratchGrowing up in Boston, Etchings was surrounded by a big family with a lot of love and little means. After her parents' divorce, Etchings watched her mom work three jobs-never complaining.""A big motivator for me early on in life was making sure that she never had to worry,"" Etchings says, ""and that I never had to depend on anybody else financially.""Without money for a plane ticket, Etchings found her own way to university, arranging rides from Boston to Tuscan, Arizona, with friends and family. An avid athlete fascinated by how the body works, she began her college career studying nutrition biochemistry. But after being approached by an acquaintance who worked in the financial industry, she shifted her focus to financial advising.""I'm so grateful for him because he saw something in me that never would have been on my radar."" Etchings says.After graduating, Etchings worked for eight years as a financial advisor under a corporation before deciding to go out on her own as an advisor in the Tucson area. Hustling for a couple years, it was clear to Etchings that for greater opportunity, she'd have to move. So, she packed up for Los Angeles, leaving behind her book of business, knowing she'd again be starting from scratch.Story continues""I took that risk and networked nonstop,"" Etchings says. ""And that's when I started to build out my team, brought in two business partners, and then we started to grow and built out a team of 11.""As business hummed along, Etchings relocated to Boston and managed her practice flying from coast to coast monthly. Eventually, it caught up to her. ""I kind of lost my passion for the day to day of being an advisor,"" Etchings says.""After about nine months of hemming and hawing about what I wanted to do, I sold my book of business to my partners, and I took some time off.""Etchings gave herself a strict timeline-no less than six months and no more than 24 months-to figure out how to translate her passions to her next career.Was she scared? Sure, she was worried about being able to connect to and find her purpose. But did she fear that she wouldn't be successful? Absolutely not.Focusing on long-term potentialAfter about two years of reflection and conversations with her business coach, Etchings realized her passion: leadership. She cold called a financial company and earned a leadership position. It was a huge financial step backward, ""but I knew that if I took that risk, and I doubled down and just believed in what I could accomplish, ultimately I'd get to where I want to go,"" Etchings says. And she did.Through this success, Principal got Etchings' name and tapped her to help build and lead a group of advisors in the New England area. Understanding she was stepping into another career gamble with no immediate financial upside, Etchings wanted to make sure she got to know the people she'd be working with.Talking to her potential future colleagues, Etchings says, ""I remember thinking there was one person that was there for less than 15 years-only one. And I thought, wow, Principal must be doing something right if all these people are still here.""Etchings took the job on one condition: If she delivered on the expectations, she'd be given the opportunity to take on more.""I delivered after two years. And to the company's credit, I was asked to take on a regional vice president role,"" Etchings says. ""Two years after that, I was promoted to national vice president.""Etchings credits her ability to see past the short term as a key factor in her success.""The short-term decisions really can help dictate that long-term growth,"" Etchings says. ""And I feel like a lot of people step over dollars to pick up dimes because they're more concerned about immediate gratification versus the opportunity to look at what a future opportunity can be.""Creating more equal opportunityEtchings' success is somewhat of an anomaly in the financial world. If not educated by an acquaintance all those years ago, Etchings says, she may have never even known about financial advising as a career possibility.And even with this exposure, Etchings recalls being the only female and one of only three out of 32 trainees in her class who successfully became licensed to practice. ""There was always something fundamentally outdated in bringing people on,"" she says.So, Etchings and colleagues created the Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship within the Principal Financial Network, a program designed to create an additional runway for diverse financial advisor candidates.""We need to create opportunities and a pathway to bring people into the industry so they can help create financial stability for individuals and families from all different backgrounds,"" Etchings says.She thinks about her own family and the difference a financial advisor could've made for them. Getting out ahead despite this is ""gratifying for sure,"" Etchings says. But that doesn't mean she's satisfied.""I'm always looking at what impact I can make next,"" she says.Find a career that fits your skills and passions at principal.com/careers.Disclosures and compliance number​Insurance products issued by Principal National Life Insurance Company (except in NY) and Principal Life Insurance Company®, and the companies available through the Preferred Product Network, Inc.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores.

380,11c91a68-75f4-3330-add7-5805d48e1fa5,PEP,2023-08-23,The 3 Most Undervalued Retirement Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-retirement-stocks-201429059.html,1692216869,STORY,"['JNJ', 'PEP', 'MSFT']","[The past few years have made many people realize the importance of building a retirement portfolio. Having dealt with a pandemic, layoffs, and inflation, investors realize the importance of having a solid portfolio that sustains any market situation. For most, retirement investing is about picking stocks that pay high dividends and can generate passive income. However, I like to pick stocks that not only generate steady income but also have the potential to sustain any market situation and offer capital growth over the years. Such companies have stable balance sheets, solid histories, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. These undervalued retirement stocks are low-risk and offer stability for your retirement portfolio. Let’s take a look at the top retirement stocks to buy in August. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockA personal favorite, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), doesn’t disappoint. Inflation has had a huge impact on our wallets over the past year and reduced consumer discretionary spending. However, the demand for healthy snacks and beverages remained strong. In these types of environments, brands with pricing power win. PepsiCo showed its pricing power in the second quarter earnings. The company increased the prices of its products to offset the rising costs and still saw a double-digit rise in organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share. PepsiCo demonstrated resilience and the ability to grow in an inflationary environment.The company also enjoys an edge in the market with its wide range of brands. It owns several snack brands that helped the company achieve GAAP 10% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter. In an uncertain market, PepsiCo is a safe bet. PEP stock is trading at $181 today and is moving toward the 52-week high of $196. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.79% and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.26, which is a 10% rise over the previous dividend. It has a dividend payout ratio of 65% which is much higher than the industry standards. PepsiCo also can increase the dividends in the coming years and as we see the revenue grow, we could see a higher dividend payout. It is one of the undervalued retirement stocks to buy now. Story continuesPepsiCo has raised its outlook for organic revenue growth to 10% for this year and expects the EPS to come in at $7.47 for the year. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. The company has a vast portfolio of products and a solid history. However, it has been dealing with several lawsuits and offered settlements. The lawsuits grab headlines, but investors don’t need to worry much. The company is financially strong and has an impressive balance sheet.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a diversified portfolio of products and is less volatile than the stock market. The demand for pharmaceuticals and medical devices is insulated from the short term ups and downs. The company is in a good position to continue generating revenue for years to come. Johnson &amp; Johnson also owns some blockbuster devices and medicines that continue to generate significant income year after year. JNJ stock is exchanging hands at $172 and is not cheap, but this stock is poised to continue rewarding investors for many years to come. Johnson &amp; Johnson split off the consumer health division into a separate company and I believe this will boost its revenue growth over the long run. Even with inflation, people will be looking for ways to improve their health and wellbeing which bodes well for JNJ. The Dividend King has enjoyed consecutive dividend increases for 62 years and is a top pick for dividend investors. It enjoys a dividend yield of 2.75% and has recently paid a quarterly dividend of $1.19. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 44% which is much higher than the industry average. Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech leader that holds a position in every portfolio. The company has been steadily moving upwards and I strongly believe it will continue to do so. It is dominating the software business and is known for some of the top brands including Windows and Azure. Several global companies depend on Microsoft for their daily operations and it is investing heavily into artificial intelligence. While the company has a comparatively low dividend yield at 0.85% and a quarterly dividend of $0.68, it has enough room to raise the dividend for many years. Its AI expansion is moving at a strong pace and the company has reported impressive revenue numbers. The company reported earnings per share of $2.69 and revenue of $56.19 billion. One solid reason to invest in the company is its diversified portfolio of products and the ability to sustain any market condition. MSFT stock is trading at $320 today and while the stock isn’t cheap, it does have the potential to hit $500 in the long term.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:18% = US$4.3b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 20%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 24% seen over the past five years by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 24% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Given that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has entered into an agreement with Regeneron to support clinical development, clinical manufacturing and the regulatory licensure process of a next-generation COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The agreement is part of ‘Project NextGen,’ an initiative by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to advance a pipeline of new, innovative vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.BARDA, part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at HHS, and Regeneron have previously worked together to deliver novel medicines for Ebola and COVID-19 at unprecedented speed and under urgent circumstances. The new program announced today falls under Regeneron and BARDA’s ongoing Other Transactions Agreement initiated in 2017 to develop a portfolio of antibodies targeting up to 10 pathogens that pose significant risk to public health. For the new COVID-19 program, HHS will fund up to 70 percent of Regeneron’s costs for certain clinical development activities for a next-generation monoclonal antibody therapy with broad neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The new contract has an estimated value of up to approximately $326 million of government funding.“We’re pleased to expand our longstanding BARDA relationship, which is predicated on Regeneron’s decades of investment in deep scientific research and enabling technologies,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “Although COVID-19 has moved to an endemic stage, many people – including those with immunocompromising conditions – continue to face exposure that impacts their everyday life and could cause serious health consequences. We believe Regeneron can once again apply our drug discovery and development expertise to help prevent disease in vulnerable populations. American biopharmaceutical companies developed remarkable COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines in record time, successfully changing the course of the pandemic, and we’re gratified that the U.S. Government continues to support early research from this uniquely innovative industry.”Story continuesUnder the project structure, Regeneron independently invents and proposes an antibody candidate, which BARDA and Regeneron will then evaluate and agree upon for further development, manufacturing and regulatory activities. Regeneron’s most advanced next-generation antibody candidate under this agreement is expected to enter clinical trials later this year.Starting in early 2020, Regeneron scientists rapidly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by discovering and manufacturing a highly potent, anti-spike antibody cocktail that successfully neutralized many SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta. Developed at record speed and first granted Emergency Use Authorization in November 2020, the antibody cocktail was used as a COVID-19 treatment and preventative for millions of people around the globe, with nearly 3 million doses delivered to the U.S. Government between 2020 and 2022.The next-generation antibody project is being funded in part with federal funds from BARDA under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.About Regeneron Regeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops, and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. Founded and led for 35 years by physician-scientists, Regeneron’s unique ability to repeatedly and consistently translate science into medicine has led to numerous FDA-approved treatments and product candidates in development, almost all of which were homegrown in Regeneron's laboratories.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Portions of Union Pacific’s Yuma subdivision in California are still offline following Tropical Storm Hilary, but “progress continues to be made” to restore the tracks, UP said in a Tuesday service update.UP (NYSE: UNP) is referring to an area between Banning and Indio, California, on the Yuma subdivision. Water, mud and debris covered areas of track as a result of the storm, according to recent service advisories, and reopening track there will depend on when UP can repair a bridge.“Mud continues to flow back onto the tracks. Our Operating and Engineering teams are bringing in additional equipment to assist in clearing the track. There is a segment of double track that traverses a bridge that will need to be rebuilt. We anticipate one of these tracks will reopen early in the morning. Once the first track is open, we will have limited use of this line segment. The second track is dependent upon the bridge repair. Early estimates indicate the track may be out of service for approximately two weeks,” UP said in the service update.Portions of Union Pacific’s Yuma subdivision got hit by Tropical Storm Hilary. (Photo: Union Pacific)But UP’s Mojave subdivision, which had also been offline because of the storm, is now back in service. The areas that had been affected were near Mojave and north of Fontana, according to UP.“Although we have returned service to some of the impacted segments, it will take multiple days to work through the backlog of trains,” UP said. “For safety purposes, these line segments will have temporary slow order speed restrictions placed upon them. We will also need to re-align locomotive power and crews to the region and customers should expect extended delays through the week.”On Monday, BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B) said in a service advisory that it was working with UP on restoring the Mojave subdivision. BNSF uses UP’s tracks between Bakersfield, California, and Mojave. Because of that temporary outage, BNSF warned customers moving shipments to and from Northern California to expect delays.BNSF also said Monday that its intermodal facilities in greater Los Angeles are fully operational and that there were no Hilary-related impacts at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.Story continuesRail network visibility platform RailState, which recently expanded its coverage to include Southern California, noted that “normal rail flows stopped” after Sunday evening. The last loaded train to pass through the Loma Linda area was an eastbound mixed-manifest train with 109 cars, and it passed by at 8:39 p.m. PT, according to RailState.Ten days before the storm hit, the route saw an average of 31 trains, carrying a total of 3,600 carloads and 4,300 containers, RailState said.“The weather this year is something most of us would like to forget, but these are the trends that we all have to react to, including the railroads,” John Schmitter, RailState co-founder and chief commercial officer, said in a Monday release. “Some of these recent examples show how resilient rail can be. Tracks can be repaired quickly and service can be back to normal in days, while fixes to roadways may cause congestion for months or longer.”Meanwhile, the Surface Transportation Board said late Monday afternoon that it is actively monitoring rail service disruptions caused by Hilary. The agency also asked rail carriers, shippers and other stakeholders to contact STB if they are experiencing rail service disruptions that could create an emergency situation.“Freight and passenger rail service interruptions extending north and east from Southern and Central California have been reported,” STB said, adding that it will use its emergency service authority under federal law if needed.Southern California braced for the storm over the weekend, with California Gov.

If you want to skip our introduction to insider trading and Mr. Fisher then skip to Ken Fisher's and Insiders' 5 Stock Picks.Insider trading is often thought to be illegal. The most commonly understood definition of insider trading, and one that is also against the law, is trading the shares of a firm based on non publicly available information. As an example, if your uncle worked at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and he told you that during its upcoming earnings call the firm will announce a shut down of U.S. manufacturing, and you used this information to buy Put options before the earnings to profit from a drop in the share price, then this would be insider trading. Depending on the scale of your trade, the SEC might fine you and your uncle or even send you to jail.However, another variety of insider trading is legal. This involves the purchasing or selling of a firm's shares by its management or large investors, and the transactions are reported on a publicly traded firm's SEC page and the purchases are often evaluated by investors to gauge what these people, which generally have a deeper insight into the firm's operations, are thinking about their company. At the same time, management, and particularly top level executives such as chief executive officers also buy shares to project their confidence in their firm's prospects to potentially assuage any large investor concerns that might be present.The lucrative nature of the stock market and the potential it offers to make millions means that even though insider trading is illegal, it will most likely never go away. It continues to generate headlines in the media, and recently, one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading companies in the world is finding itself on its web. This firm is none other than the embattled cryptocurrency trading platform Binance, whose chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has stopped all Binance employees from engaging in any form of futures trading. Additionally, the company has a new policy in place that now require employees from holding their investments for at least 90 days, which is aimed to stop them from profiteering in the short term on the basis of information that might be unavailable to the broader public.Story continuesAt the same time, while Binance might not be facing any legal action against insider trading, one publicly traded firm that is facing an insider trading lawsuit is Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG). The growth in online learning after the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the demand for such platforms, and at the same time, it has also allowed unscrupulous students to cheat on their tests or use other unfair advantages to distort their academic results. This has landed the CEO of San Francisco 49ers Mr. Jed York at the center of a lawsuit against Chegg which claims that not only did the company profit from college students using it to cheat on their exams, but that Mr. York and other directors sold stock while the shares were at their peak without informing investors about the scale of the fraud that was being conducted through Chegg. The company's shares were trading at $113 in February 2021 when online education was at its peak but then lost their luster as in person classes resumed. Mr. York is accused of making a cool $1.4 million from inflated share prices, and for its part, Chegg has denied any wrongdoing as it claims that it is ""vigorously defending itself"" from the allegations.While insider purchases provide one way to determine if a stock might appreciate in the future, another popular method of sifting through the thousands of companies on the stock market is by taking a look at what hedge funds are doing. After all, these are professionals who spend most of their day pouring over anything and everything related to the stock market, so their decision carry a lot of weight as well. One of the most successful hedge fund investors of all time is the billionaire founder of Fisher Investments Mr. Ken Fisher. Having spent decades on the stock market, Mr. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, and he often has remarkable insights into the market that are based purely on the key determinants of market health such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth instead of the chatter that often clouds the truth behind what can take place in the future. He was one of the few investors that was actually bullish last year, and we all know how that played out as markets stunned everyone in 2023 to produce double digit returns. So naturally, his words have a lot of weight to them, and as to what he thinks will happen in the future, here's a glimpse inside his mind about the rest of the year:Let me just say that all these sentiment features lead to pessimism. And as a bull market begins, there's this feature that I've talked about before that I call the Pessimism of Disbelief, which is the tendency of people to get more pessimistic as the market starts to go up. Where maybe we had a bottom in June, the middle of June, on June 14. Maybe we had a bottom, depending on how you measure it, which indexes you look at in July, the stocks are higher either way. And when you think about these things, it is normal. I'm not saying those were the bottom. I don't really know.But it is normal when you have a bear market make a bottom and start to go up for people to keep getting more pessimistic as it goes up. The pessimism leads to future positive surprise which becomes doubly bullish fully buoying the bull market.And you should view today's sentiment as the precursor to higher prices ahead without any precise timing of whether we've had the bottom, the bottom still a little bit ahead. What's going on? That negative sentiment is not consistent with a world that's about to fall apart. It's more consistent with a world that's already seen its stock market bottom and is starting to rise and the Pessimism of Disbelief builds.So, you get yes buts to all positivity, all new things that come along better than people feared as people keep looking for the bad that looking for the bad is a good. And you should view sentiment in that way because negative sentiment is one of the most bullish features you can get.So, we decided to take a look at some stocks that are both the top picks of Ken Fisher and have seen insider activity lately. The top picks are The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Adobe Inc.

389,d36e3c4a-c59e-33bf-864d-c8d39f336cd4,UNP,2023-08-23,Those who invested in Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) five years ago are up 63%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-union-pacific-nyse-130017890.html,1692709217,STORY,['UNP'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) share price is 47% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 5.7% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Union Pacific actually saw its EPS drop 5.3% per year.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.The revenue growth of 2.0% per year hardly seems impressive. So why is the share price up? It's not immediately obvious to us, but a closer look at the company's progress over time might yield answers.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnion Pacific is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Union Pacific's TSR for the last 5 years was 63%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Union Pacific had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 6.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Union Pacific , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:CSCO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-ownership-cisco-systems-inc-120020226.html,1692792020,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Cisco Systems' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 43% ownership Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$226b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 21% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cisco Systems, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cisco Systems' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cisco Systems. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Cisco Systems. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support growth in data services.More efforts to develop smart connected homes, hospitals, factories, buildings, cities and self-driving vehicles bode well for industry players. These firms invest heavily in LTE, broadband and fiber to provide additional capacity and improve Internet and wireless networks. These initiatives hold promise.The Uptick in Wi-Fi 6 Networking to Drive Momentum: Brisk technological advancement, dynamic products, high-speed connectivity, low latency and evolving industry standards define the Computer Networking industry.

The rapid proliferation of IoT, the increasing popularity of smart connected devices and the growing adoption of cloud computing in network security fuel the demand for an efficient network support infrastructure.The advancements in AI and ML and the high adoption of cloud applications hold immense potential for companies in the industry. Enterprises are striving to manage fixed and wireless devices in a secured infrastructure. To address the demand, industry firms are driving innovation in networking technologies, including network virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which favors growth prospects.Increase in IT Spending Amid Economic Turmoil Bodes Well: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 4.3% in 2023 from 2022 levels and reach around $4.7 trillion. The report added that despite macroeconomic headwinds, enterprises are increasing spending on digital business initiatives, which bodes well for industry participants.Gartner states that the software segment is likely to witness double-digit growth in the current year. However, consumers are deferring spending on the purchase of devices, which will likely affect the IT spending growth to an extent in 2023. Gartner expects the devices segment to decline by nearly 8.6% in 2023.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Near-Term ProspectsThe Zacks Computer - Networking Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

395,d054b917-6fe6-3c2b-b0d0-8263ff68c8d1,CSCO,2023-08-23,Cisco's Sustainability 101: What Are Virgin Plastics?,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciscos-sustainability-101-virgin-plastics-124500127.html,1692708300,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 22, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, August 22, 2023, Press release pictureDo you feel a bit lost when people refer to certain environmental sustainability topics and aren't sure where to start when it comes to learning more? Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering.This blog was written by Nicole Kenney, Program Manager, Sustainable Packaging, and Drew Phan, Packaging Engineer.As part of modern life, most of the products we buy come in plastic packaging. When you buy something with plastic packaging, you're probably not aware of what type of plastic it is. There is recycled plastic, which is when recycled bits of plastic are reprocessed into plastic products. And there is also virgin plastic, also known as virgin plastic polymers, which according to a 2022 report, means ""newly manufactured resin produced from petrochemical or biomass feedstock used as the raw material for the manufacture of plastic products and which has never been used or processed before.""Essentially, virgin plastics are manufactured from previously unused materials, which means they can take a bigger toll on the environment.Since the 1950s, plastic has overrun the packaging industry by providing inexpensive and light-weight protection for products. Plastic packaging is widely available in the form of conventional foams, bags, and clamshell trays. Over the decades, this has led to a global build up of plastic pollution, since these materials are not always managed correctly at end of use. Although plastics are found in all major municipal solid waste categories, in the United States the containers and packaging category had the most plastic tonnage at over 14.5 million tons in 2018 alone (EPA Source #1). That is equivalent to the weight of over 300,000 gray whales. The sheer volume of waste has led to growing awareness around the impact of packaging and increased customer demand for sustainable alternatives.Story continuesAt the same time, a product has little to no value if it arrives damaged. Cisco's Packaging Engineering division thinks holistically when it comes to designing Cisco's packaging with sustainability in mind. We are rethinking product packaging and are sourcing alternative materials to plastic. Our strategy includes eliminating plastic bags in our packaging wherever possible. As an example, we have removed plastic packaging from our power cords, resulting in a reduction of over 10 million bags annually. Work is underway to apply the same efforts across additional component categories.Design for RecyclabilityWhere we cannot completely remove plastic packaging, we must choose alternatives with a smaller environmental footprint. This means opting for recyclable materials that are easily separated and widely accepted in curbside recycling streams. Once these materials are recovered, they can be broken down and re-processed into the feedstock for the next round of packaging.As an example, our plastic thermoform cushions are made of the same high-density polyethylene material as milk jugs and can be accepted in the same plastic curbside recycling stream.* According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) is one of the most frequently recycled plastics in the United States (EPA source #1).In the case of plastic bags in our accessory kits, efforts are underway to utilize fiber-based paper envelopes and corrugated sleeves that are recyclable. Paper is currently the best alternative because it is the most recycled material in the United States (EPA source #2).Choose Recycled MaterialsRecycled materials are different from recyclable materials in that recycled packaging has a percentage of material inputs that have already been broken down and reprocessed after use. By incorporating more recycled content into our packaging, we conserve valuable resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to manufacturing virgin materials. Choosing recycled materials also promotes recycling by increasing the demand for recycled materials.We are focusing our energy on recyclable and recycled plastics because, unfortunately, biodegradable and compostable plastics aren't well suited for use in the electronics industry.Biodegradable and bio-based are terms used loosely to describe plastics made from plant sources. The biggest concern for these materials is that it is not always clear how long it will take for these plastics to break down. Since they are often not certified compostable, they can potentially leech toxins into the soil. (SPC source #3)When it comes to compostable packaging, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Green Guides explain that this packaging must be certified with ""competent and reliable scientific evidence that all materials in the product or package will break down into - or become part of - usable compost safely and in about the same time as the materials with which it is composted"" (FTC source #4). This is good for organic waste like food scraps, grass clippings and yard waste. But currently, the shorter shelf life of compostable packaging makes it better suited for food packaging than the electronics industry.A circular strategyWe are evolving to a more circular model in which we reduce the resources we consume and the waste we generate. With this approach, we try to prioritize materials with recycled content; design products for resource efficiency; and facilitate repair, remanufacturing, and recycling to extend product life. That's why we have a goal for 100% of new Cisco products and packaging to incorporate Circular Design Principles by fiscal year 2025.** Using recycled materials is an example of one of our principles.By pursuing our goal to incorporate Circular Design Principles, we can use less virgin material, and consume less material overall. Reducing our packaging carbon footprint will drive progress towards Cisco's packaging goals (Source #5).As we take the necessary steps to embed Circular Design Principles into our packaging portfolio, it is important to remember that every choice has tradeoffs - there is no one-size fits all solution. Achieving circularity is an iterative process - what is best for today may not be what's best for tomorrow. But if we remain agile and strive for success, we can continue to move in a positive direction towards a circular economy.Follow our Packaging Engineering team's journey as we continue to evolve our circular packaging portfolio (Source #6).__________________________________________________________________________* Check your local municipality for more info.** In fiscal year 2022, we had conducted a soft launch of a new scoring tool that evaluates circularity in products and packaging. We used the soft launch to evaluate 13% of new products and packaging, and found that 33% of them successfully met our circular design criteria. This is equivalent to 4% of total new products and packaging released in fiscal year 2022 meeting circular design criteria. In early fiscal 2023, the scoring tool was formally launched across all business units, and we expect the universe of new products and packaging evaluated to increase in fiscal 2023.SOURCES:Plastics: Material-Specific Data | US EPAPaper and Paperboard: Material-Specific Data | US EPAPublic_SPC-Position-Statement_Biodegradable-Packaging.pdf (sustainablepackaging.org)Environmental Claims: Summary of the Green Guides | Federal Trade Commission (ftc.gov)Environmental Goals - Cisco ESG HubCisco Sustainable Packaging - CiscoView original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/775935/Ciscos-Sustainability-101-What-Are-Virgin-Plastics]"
