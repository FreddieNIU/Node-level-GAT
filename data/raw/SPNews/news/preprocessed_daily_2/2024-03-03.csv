Although the company has conducted multiple stock splits in the past, its most recent was nearly 25 years ago."", ""However, Walmart's biggest news of 2024 so far has nothing to do with its 3-for-1-stock split. The company's most momentous announcement offers an opportunity to boost the giant retailer's fastest-growing business."", ""Before we get to that major announcement, let's take a quick look at Walmart's fastest-growing business. It isn't the company's brick-and-mortar retail stores. Walmart's stores still generate the lion's share of total revenue. However, this part of the company's business isn't its top growth driver, whether we're talking about U.S. or international stores. It isn't Sam's Club, either."", ""What about e-commerce? Nope. To be sure, this is a booming area for Walmart. Global e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal 2024. This figure includes 44% international growth."", ""Walmart's fastest-growing business, though, is...advertising. Overall, the company's advertising revenue soared 33% year over year in Q4. In the U.S., Walmart Connect allows advertisers to reach customers through search, online, and in stores via screens, events, product samples, and more. Outside the U.S., the company's Flipkart and Walmex units generate advertising sales."", ""Granted, Walmart's advertising revenue only amounts to pocket change for the giant retailer right now. In fiscal 2024, global advertising sales totaled $3.4 billion. That's only around 0.5% of Walmart's total revenue. But there's no other revenue source for the company that's climbing as rapidly."", ""So, what is Walmart's biggest news of 2024 so far? The company announced plans to acquire Vizio (NYSE: VZIO) in an all-cash deal valued at close to $2.3 billion."", ""Walmart has sold Vizio's TVs in its discount retail stores for years. However, the company's main goal in buying Vizio is to get its SmartCast Operating System. SmartCast enables users to stream content from multiple sources on devices. And it's a perfect fit with Walmart's advertising business."", 'In the press release announcing the deal, Seth Dallaire, Walmart U.S. executive vice president and chief revenue officer, stated: ""Our media business, Walmart Connect, is helping brands create meaningful connections with millions of customers who shop with us each week."" He added, ""We believe the combination of these two businesses would be impactful as we redefine the intersection of retail and entertainment.""', ""More than 500 direct advertisers use the SmartCast platform, including many of the biggest companies in the world. Vizio's Platform+ unit, made up primarily of its advertising business, is the main source of the company's gross profit."", ""I don't think Walmart's acquisition of Vizio provides a compelling reason to rush out and buy the stock. For one thing, the deal hasn't been finalized yet. Regulators must approve the transaction. Vizio can also terminate the agreement within a specified period if it receives a more attractive offer."", 'However, I expect the transaction will close relatively soon. I view it as a smart business move for Walmart that will indeed increase its advertising revenue.', ""My main reason for being reluctant to buy Walmart stock right now, though, is valuation. Walmart's shares trade at more than 25 times forward earnings. That's not ridiculously expensive, but it's still a premium price. That said, I like Walmart as a long-term investment. In my view, it's a good stock to buy on a pullback -- especially if or when the Vizio transaction finalizes."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

That drop stands in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has rallied by nearly 28% in the past 12 months. Target's returns even trailed industry peers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) by a wide margin."", ""That performance gap reflects the company's weakening customer traffic trends as shoppers shifted spending away from discretionary purchases like home furnishings. It's hard to grow sales when you're catering to fewer guests with each passing quarter."", ""Target's growth problems could be ending soon, however. And as investors wait for the rebound, they can collect an unusually high dividend yield for the retailing industry. Let's look at some reasons why income investors might want to put Target stock near the top of their watch lists."", ""The retailer is slated to post its holiday-quarter earnings results in March, and there's reason for cautious optimism about that update. That's because Costco and Walmart each announced accelerating sales gains for their holiday quarters, confirming that shoppers were spending more freely as 2023 ended."", ""The latest report from Costco was particularly encouraging because it showed rising demand in the consumer discretionary space, which has been under significant pressure lately. This niche is Target's most important, and even a small rebound here could put the chain on the cusp of a revenue resurgence."", ""Comparable-store sales fell 5% in the third quarter (ended Oct. 28, 2023), and management predicted that Q4 results would land in a wide range around that same rate. Most Wall Street pros are looking for reported revenue to rise slightly this quarter, perhaps ending the chain's long sales slide."", ""The news is more clearly positive when it comes to Target's finances. Cash flow soared in 2023 as the company focused on efficiency and cut inventory in slow-moving merchandise categories. Prices rose in other areas, too, leading to a 27% gross profit margin through the first three quarters of 2023 (compared to 24% a year earlier). Target's operating profit improved to 5.1% of sales from 3.5% of sales, putting it closer to its pre-pandemic level of 6%."", ""It's great news that this rebound is happening even amid weak demand in the consumer discretionary niche. Resurgent growth there, then, could allow Target to easily boost margins while providing more resources that management can use to raise the dividend."", ""The big operating metric to watch in 2024 will be customer traffic, because Target absolutely needs to return to growth in this area. Yet its lower inventory and strong profitability and cash flow all point to a potentially large dividend increase when the chain makes its annual payout announcement (typically in June). Last year's hike was a modest 2% as management decided to pivot toward saving more cash."", ""The good news is Target has raised its dividend in each of the last 52 consecutive years, and its current yield of 2.9% is far above Walmart's 1.3% and Costco's 0.6%. Most investors will still want to watch this stock for now until there are concrete signs that Target has put its customer traffic slump behind it heading into fiscal 2024. That's the retailer's surest path toward rebounding earnings and higher shareholder returns from here."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Target right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Target, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024. ', 'The stock market of 2024 is driven by the same trends that saw investors glued to their screens in 2023. The primary themes in the market right now are artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, with the final week of February providing investors with key data points and news on both fronts.', ""Before we get to the news, it's important to see how large cap stocks are fairing these days. These stocks are typically sizeable, mature, and established companies that command strong market positions along with comforting balance sheets. Like other stocks, their performance is also tied to the stock market, and large cap stocks typically attract investors during economic downturns or shaky conditions as they offer comfort with their ability to hedge against major losses."", 'Diving deeper into large cap stocks, these can be divided either along their industries or their fundamentals to further fine tune any performance expectations. Large cap stocks in stable sectors such as consumer defensive, the likes of the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) or the consumer goods behemoth Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are sizeable entities whose global brand following enables investors to rest in comfort knowing that even if the stock and revenue are down in a recession, both will pick up ones the economic winds become more favorable.', 'On the flip side, large cap stocks belonging to high risk sectors such as biotechnology are significantly vulnerable to market whims as well as any whiff that investors might get about potential troubles. For instance, consider the large cap biotechnology stocks Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). These two stocks are household names due to their coronavirus vaccine, but despite being multi billion dollar firms, the shares have painted quite an eye watering performance if we consider their performance over the course of the past couple of years.', ""In fact, the risky nature of these large cap stock industries means that investors have to be on constant watch out for any headwinds that could affect business performance. For Moderna, this came in the form of a report in February 2024 that its vaccine for a respiratory virus had demonstrated reduced efficacy. The shares tumbled 7% on that day, and overall, the stock is down 22% year to date, proving that just because a stock is a large cap does not mean that it will always remain stable. Similarly, BioNTech's stock is down by nearly 15% during its latest earnings report that saw the firm stress that it would return to growth in 2025 after it scales up oncology products to mitigate the effects of a bottoming out of its COVID vaccine market."", ""So, with some drivers of large cap stock performance out of the way, let's focus on the news before a brief primer on value stocks. The tail end of February 2024 has seen large cap artificial intelligence stock Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) beat analyst second quarter revenue and profit estimates as it shared that growth in its semiconductor design products and solutions for AI chips should help with a great second quarter. Focusing on the Fed, the central bank's January meeting minutes show that participants continued to be worried about cutting interest rates too soon. This is natural since recent producer inflation prints remain stubbornly high, and for large cap value stocks, this might be good news."", 'This is because, in tight economic conditions, growth stocks, such as those characterized by high price to earnings (P/E) ratios typically fall. On the flip side, value stocks tend to hold their ground as investors have set their market share price reasonably in comparison to fundamentals such as EPS.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top large cap value stocks to buy. A couple of major names are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)."", 'A close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best large cap value stocks to buy, we ranked the top 40 holdings of the Vanguard Value ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked the top stocks.', ""For these best large cap value stocks we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

They are both leaders in their respective retailing niches, for one, and tend to show steady market-share gains with each passing year. Shareholders' returns are also boosted by significant dividend and stock buyback spending as well."", ""But which stock is a better fit for your portfolio at these prices? Let's dive right in."", ""Home Depot's business expands more quickly during economic boom times, as you might expect given its smaller revenue footprint and the chain's focus on the volatile home improvement industry. Comparable-store sales jumped 11% in 2021 as shoppers spent their rising incomes aggressively. Walmart grew at a 7% rate, by comparison."", ""The flip side of that performance is that you'll get more stable growth from owning Walmart stock. Even though consumers are spending less on merchandise these days, comps were up 6% in the just-concluded fiscal year. Home Depot reported a 4% decline. If your priority is predictability and low-risk growth, then Walmart will better satisfy your investing criteria."", ""Walmart doesn't hold a candle to Home Depot when it comes to earnings power. Sure, profits declined by 10% this past year due to the softening home improvement market. But the chain still converted over 14% of sales into operating profit compared to Walmart's 4% rate."", ""Both companies are highly efficient cash generators. Home Depot's operating cash flow jumped to $21 billion from $15 billion in 2023. Walmart grew its comparable figure by $7 billion to a cool $36 billion. Cash-focused investors won't be disappointed, in other words, with either stock."", 'Cash returns favor Home Depot, which sends more money to its shareholders through a combination of stock buybacks and dividends. The home improvement retailer also pays a bigger initial dividend yield and has hiked that payout more substantially over the last several years.', ""One understandable knock against Home Depot is that it doesn't have a particularly impressive track record of steady dividend raises. Management paused its annual hikes during the worst of the Great Recession and so the chain can only claim fewer than 20 years of consecutive increases. That's well below Walmart and rival Lowe's Companies, which each qualify as Dividend Kings due to their 50-plus years of annual boosts."", ""Home Depot is also expecting a second straight year of weak earnings growth ahead in 2024. There's little danger of another imminent dividend pause in that case. Still, the chain might announce unusually small annual increases in 2025 and into 2026 if the housing market doesn't rebound."", ""Walmart is priced at a more tempting valuation, meanwhile. Its shares will cost you around 0.75 times sales, which is lower than peers like Target and Costco Wholesale. Home Depot trades at 2.4 times sales, which is near its post-pandemic high and well above Lowe's price-to-sales ratio of 1.5."", ""These factors mostly point to Walmart as the better stock to buy today. But investors have to weigh the main benefits (stability, value) against the biggest drawbacks (lower profitability and cash returns). Walmart will deliver acceptable returns for most investors through the widest range of selling conditions. If you're a fan of high dividends and don't mind volatility, though, then you might want to take a closer look at Home Depot."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now."", ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Ron Gross sitting in for Dylan Lewis. Joining me today are senior analysts Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. Fools, how are you doing?"", 'Andy Cross: Hey, Ron.', 'Emily Flippen: Hey.', ""Ron Gross: Fools, earnings season rolls on. We've got a lot to talk about. Today, we're going to talk acquisitions and e-commerce, but we must begin with Nvidia. On Thursday, Nvidia reported results that knocked it out of the park, and management provided guidance that was higher than analysts were expecting. Andy, I'm not even sure where to begin. This was really some report. The stock's performance is outstanding. What stood out to you? Where do we go from here?"", ""Andy Cross: Ron, these are like monopoly numbers. Nvidia has become the bellwether stock for this rally. It's up more than 60% this year alone, 275% for the past year. Since those earnings came out, team, it's added around $300 billion in market cap to be close to that $2 trillion level. That's the size of AMD. It's like a close competitor. The growth has been insane, so quickly, the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 22% from the third quarter, up 265% from a year ago. This is for a $2 trillion dollar company, don't forget. Earnings at $5.16, up 486% from a year ago. The data center revenues, that's the biggest part of their business and what is driving so much of the growth, up more than 400%."", ""When you think about what the world is spending on right now, it is so much in artificial intelligence technology, driven by Nvidia, the Hopper GPU for training and inferencing these large language models. With about half the revenues coming from these large cloud providers like Meta, like Microsoft, like AWS, revenue for China fell significantly, and those were really the only weak spots when you think about what happened. Growth accelerated through the year. For the full year, growth was up more than 120%. Again, 120% for the year, and more than 275% for the quarter. Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO, said we've hit a tipping point in generative AI."", ""Generative AI is the new application. It's enabling new ways to create software. It's a new way of computing, and this is enabling a whole new industry. Now you just see this massive growth going into the biggest part of their business, which is data center revenues. Gaming was still pretty nice, was up 15% for the entire full year. Automotive was up 20% for the full year, down for the quarter. CFO Colette Kress expects demand to far exceed supply for these next-gen products. This quarter they are expecting similar growth rates. You just don't see this kind of performance, such a large company, and Nvidia is just clearly not just knocking it out of the park, they're setting the park. If it's an artificial intelligence park, I don't know what, but these performance numbers are really outstanding."", ""Emily Flippen: It's actually amazing they're not more supply constrained than they are, because think about the businesses that can support this amount of growth. Like if you come to Chipotle and you're looking at a 100% increase in Chipotle, they're out of guac. They haven't had the opportunity to even meet that demand. The fact a year ago, management was talking about the demand cycle. They saw it coming down the pipeline. They communicated it to investors and they said, this is what we're ramping up for, and investors, myself included, were maybe a little bit skeptical and said these projections are insane. Here's the reality, they're not insane."", ""Andy Cross: It's a really interesting advantage they have is in the manufacturing because these chips they're making are so complex. They've done this for so long and invested so much into this with their partners like TSMC. They really have an edge there. What was really interesting from the call is they said that about 40% of their revenue is for the inference revenues. That's like when you do a prompt on generative AI and you get an answer, and that was really encouraging for the future growth in the chip spending for Nvidia. That was a little bit of light they shined on in the quarter."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Etsy and Wayfair reported results. Etsy's results were mixed and shares fell while Wayfair showed improved results and the stock was up 10%. Emily, any similarities here in these reports? What's Wayfair doing that Etsy isn't?"", ""Emily Flippen: This is a great example of don't judge a company by a single quarter, because if you look at these two quarters as you just mentioned, Ron, it makes it seem like, oh, Wayfair's executing right, those costs are coming down and Etsy is struggling. In reality, both of these businesses are struggling a bit, although Etsy has a better track record, I think, of proving out the usefulness of its platform in comparison with someone like Wayfair who has struggled to maintain its strategy, especially in the world post-pandemic. But both of these companies do have a similarity, as you mentioned Ron, which is both of these platforms right now are pretty out of favor. Wayfair is struggling to increase demand even as consumers remain relatively resilient."", 'If you look at just their results, their active customers over the course of the year were flat, but within the quarter as well as throughout the entirety of 2023, their lifetime revenue per active customer and their average order value all declined. The good news for Wayfair in the quarter was just the fact that they were able to cut costs. Any margin expansion is them just trying to narrow the size of their business despite the fact that their top line has been so paltry. Etsy, on the other hand, I think has struggled to maintain growth in the post-pandemic world, in the sense that its growth has continuously grown smaller than the e-commerce sector at large.', ""If you look at this quarter, this is their second full year of negative GMS growth, that's their gross merchandise sales. The second full year of negative growth, which of course is below industry averages. Both these companies, I think, are still going back to the drawing board to say, what can we do to drive consumers to our platform? Because it's not enough to say high interest rates are driving consumers away. Because we see time and time again from other consumer-facing businesses, people are willing to spend, just not here."", 'Ron Gross: Is it fair to say that Etsy is more discretionary spending focused and Wayfair has some non-discretionary and could that be impacting results?', ""Emily Flippen: I think that's fair. I will say I think Etsy has an understanding about where it stands in the consumer cycle more than something like Wayfair does. Wayfair has a ton of competitors. They're a known website, but they don't get as much direct traffic as say, Etsy. They spend more money to acquire those customers. They're competing with the Amazons of the world in a way that Etsy just isn't. They have a distinct brand at Etsy, which I think benefits them a bit more, despite the fact that what people are purchasing are things like gifts or presents, which can be, to your point, more discretionary."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, a 9% increase in its dividend, and plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio to boost its ad business. Andy, a lot to unpack here. Results look good. The acquisition is interesting to me. What's your headline here?"", 'Andy Cross: Hard to find a mass retailer with a better quarter than Walmart. As you mentioned, e-commerce sales were up 23% for the quarter. Walmart U.S. gains in grocery and those e-commerce sales were up 17% in the U.S. Global advertising was up 33%, with EPS, earnings per share, up $1.80, handily beating estimates. Generated $15 billion in free cash flow for the year, up $3 billion. Ron, as you mentioned, boosted that dividend 9%, which was the highest in 10 years. But what was really interesting was this acquisition of Vizio. It had been rumored for a week or so. It was a $2.3 billion acquisition, so not very large for the likes of someone like Walmart.', 'But as CEO Doug McMillon said, ""This acquisition accelerates the build-out of our advertising platform into the connected TV business,"" and Vizio has this SmartCast operating system. It\'s going to connect with the Walmart Connect ad platform. I think it\'s a really interesting, reasonably priced way for Walmart to continue to build out that advertising network. Interesting, you saw a lot of those adtech companies fall off on this news because now all of a sudden you have one of the best operators in the world, really making a deeper push into connected television advertising. Vizio has 500 direct advertising partners and many of them are part of the Fortune 500, so it\'s a really good fit for Walmart.', 'Ron Gross: Fifty-first consecutive year of dividend increases, 25 times forward earnings for Walmart. Do you like the stock?', ""Andy Cross: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. Don't expect the massive growth because they are really looking and pushing aggressively into these, what we all thought were like side businesses, but very much could be core. Also, their international business is doing quite well, too."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Teladoc reported a fourth-quarter loss that was less than expected, but sales were disappointing and management issued weak forward guidance. Emily, the stock got whacked. Is Teladoc's growth story officially coming to an end here?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think Teladoc's growth story has been coming to an end for a pretty extensive period of time. I know a lot of people will point to the pandemic as an indicator that this telemedicine provider was always going to be something that people only used when they were stuck at home, and that of course, people go back to their doctors' offices whenever the pandemic has let up. Certainly, there has been some of that, but I think that oversimplifies the story of Teladoc, which is to say that the thesis behind this business was that they were going to spend immediately of a lot of money up front to acquire and roll up all of these smaller telemedicine providers until they were the dominant force."", ""They have a fair amount of relationships with healthcare plans, but that roll-up strategy ended up being incredibly expensive at a time when the businesses that they were acquiring were just trading at insane valuations, which made it really challenging for Teladoc to actually gain market share, as well as drive profitability. We're still seeing the outfall of that today. That was what we saw in this most recent quarter, which was sales growth was pretty paltry, only around 4%. Indicators for that slowdown, especially in margin expansion, to continue. But they are still looking to improve their business. Now, I will say this, that margin expansion they're aiming for, they're saying 5,200 basis points of margin expansion for adjusted EBITDA over the next three years, each year. It's always good to be like, hey, look, we're driving profitability, but gosh, 5,200 basis points with this company is not enough. In this past quarter, they had 260 basis points of expansion. That just shows you how much that slowdown is happening in terms of their margin."", ""Ron Gross: Coming up, we'll talk cybersecurity and an acquisition in the banking sector. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here in studio with Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. On Tuesday, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks reported results that were not met with enthusiasm. It wasn't necessarily the quarterly results, but more so a change to its strategy that's spooked investors. Emily, results didn't seem to warrant a 25% drop in the stock. What's the problem with the new strategy that has investors running for the door?"", ""Emily Flippen: Just looking at the quarter as you mentioned, things look great, that's 16% billings growth. Whatever strategy Palo Alto has been implementing to this point, has worked for the stock, it's worked for investors. So when the management came out and said, hey, we had 16% of billings growth this quarter, but we think that's going to be 2%-3% next quarter. Investors shot first and asked questions later, which is understandable. In addition with Palo Alto falling, a lot of other cybersecurity companies start falling as well. Which begs the question of, is this a slowdown in demand for cybersecurity in general, or is this a Palo Alto-specific issue? The answer, in my opinion, is very much the latter."", ""Palo Alto is implementing a change in their kind of, I wouldn't call strategy, I'd say tactics of way of acquiring customers, which is to say when companies are in the process of shifting their security to the cloud, they're oftentimes working with numerous different vendors, all of which Palo Alto seeks to replace. It can make that transition challenging for them. Palo Alto historically, alongside other companies, has been transitioning and charging full up front despite the fact that that company may be working with different vendors. Under their new strategy, what they're effectively doing is providing their services for free until those existing vendor contracts end later on. This could be a period of effectively years. But management thinks that this is going to accelerate their long-term revenue growth even though it shows a slowdown in the short term and that this could theoretically be a more offensive strategy to gain market share in an industry that is becoming increasingly competitive."", 'Ron Gross: Price wars maybe in the future here as a result of this move.', ""Emily Flippen: That's what a lot of people are saying, but I think it still remains TBD whether or not companies like CrowdStrike, for instance, are really going to feel the need to provide their platform for free when they've managed to convert so many enterprise spenders with full payments right up front."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Capital One announced that it would acquire Discover Financial in an all-stock transaction worth $32.3 billion. This deal would combine two of the largest credit card companies in the U.S. Andy, what's got Capital One interested in Discover? Do you like the deal?"", ""Andy Cross: Yeah, it's really about the network. So buying that Discover network, it's one of the major ones with Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Granted, it's much smaller than those, based on data from our sister company, The Ascent, reports that Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have about 96% market share of payment volume with Discovery at 4%. So it's much smaller but it's unique. Capital One now is going out to spend an all-stock deal valued about $35 billion to acquire this network and that network that they'll be able to bring into their family and start to move some of their Mastercard and Visa credit cards over to Discover family."", ""When you start thinking about what Richard Fairbank, the co-founder and CEO of Capital One, calls the Holy Grail, to be both an issuer and a network provider. That's real magic because it starts to connect them with those merchants that Discover has that Capital One just didn't have access to. It is not a sure thing. The stock's at about $120-ish and the deal point would be at about $140. There's some concern that regulatory issues are going to keep this deal from happening. But overall, if you're a Cap One shareholder, I think that's a good deal for you to buy this. It could dilute a little bit of the book value, but overall, I think the long-term picture for Cap One with Discover is pretty bright."", 'Ron Gross: Banking sector always controversial, especially within the Senate. It is an election year. Do you think we will have some senators here, some government officials here clamoring for this deal not to get done?', ""Andy Cross: We're already seeing it. Senator Warren's come out pretty aggressively saying don't do the deal. They do expect it to close late 2024, or early 2025. I can't see a closing this year. If it gets through it will probably be early next year. But I do think it'll get very high scrutiny and that's one reason why the stock is not really that close to the acquisition price."", 'Ron Gross: Would you recommend an arbitrage here?', ""Andy Cross: I would not arbitrage the stock. I think if you're a Discover shareholder, hold onto your shares."", 'Ron Gross: Sounds good. On Thursday, MercadoLibre reported solid sales results, but earnings were hurt by what appears to be two non-recurring tax charges. Emily, first, are the charges really non-recurring? Second, how do results look if we adjust for them?', ""Emily Flippen: To answer your question with a non-answer, yes and no. It is not recurring in the sense that the business in this most recent quarter is recognizing a lot of expenses associated with the change in tax status right up front, when less than 1% of that is actually attributable to their actions over the last quarter. You can understand why they backed that out. But yes, it can be recurring in the sense that management did say that moving forward under these new tax rules, they're going to have around $20 million a quarter in incremental charges."", ""In addition to that, they have this lawsuit that they are expecting that they're now going to lose it. It seems to be non-material for the business moving forward, stemming from some rather old liability associated with its business over the past decade. But all those expenses being recognized in the quarter did bring that non-adjusted number down. But even if you just back out those numbers, results still came in a bit less than what the market expected."", ""The good news is sales were strong, so the stock is not down massively. The thesis for MercadoLibre hasn't been broken, but they did fail to keep up with the pace of inflation in Argentina, which resulted in the margin of sales coming from that country to be a little bit lower. I think investors should continue to really watch the fintech business here, though. This is the driving force, what I believe to be the driving force behind MercadoLibre's profitability, which is their expansion of credit offerings, debit cards, bank accounts. All of which continue to explode."", ""Andy Cross: When you think about that fintech business that Emily just talked about, the performance of non-performing loans due 90 days or longer fell from almost 30% to 18.7% this quarter over the past year. That's a good sign. They're seeing less and less on the non-performing side. But they have increased the provision to those doubtful accounts to the highest of the year. I think there is maybe perhaps some investor concern that it is going to be a little bit more challenging environment for them. But the fintech side, aside for Mercado Libre, what I think it's just continues to be interesting is the logistics business."", ""They shipped 407 million items. That was up 31%, next-day items shipped was up 21% year over year. Now almost 50% of all the products they ship go across the MercadoLibre logistics business. Again, they just continue to build out that ecosystem. They've a little budding streaming business. I just really liked the way they are positioning themselves, but there are all these macro factors that investors have to watch and we certainly watch them over in Stock Advisor."", ""Ron Gross: On Friday, stock was down about 10%. I'm still not really seeing the reason for it. Do you think that potentially could be overblown?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think there's an expectation now with those impending tax charges that their margin's going to be just mildly lower than what analysts expect. That combined with the failure in expansion of profitability and inflation, Argentina, probably just lowered expectations."", ""Ron Gross: All right, Fools, we'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, a conversation with Bloomberg reporter Kurt Wagner about Twitter and his book, The Battle for the Bird. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Kurt Wagner, a Bloomberg reporter covering social media companies and author of the new book, The Battle for the Bird. They discussed Twitter's early days, lessons from Musk's takeover, and what makes the old Twitter so hard to replicate."", ""Deidre Woollard: I love this book. I love the idea of the history of Twitter, and you go back before everything really started getting crazy. I want to take the listeners back because I want to start with a couple of alternate universe questions because you talk about 2015. Twitter's casting around for a new CEO before bringing back Jack Dorsey, and they look at Andy Jassy, who now of course is Amazon CEO, but was running AWS at that point. Probably a better move for him. But what might Twitter be like with someone a little more organized at the helm?"", 'Kurt Wagner: Maybe more traditional.', 'Deidre Woollard: Traditional is a good word.', ""Kurt Wagner: Traditional business mind. Well, certainly, a more lucrative decision for Andy Jassy to stay working at Amazon. But the reason the board came to this conclusion as they thought at the time that Twitter's biggest issue was the product. They really thought if they could figure out how to grow the product, how to create maybe some killer features that the business would follow and so as a result, Jack Dorsey felt like the product choice here, Andy Jassy felt more like the business choice."", ""He was someone who obviously had a ton of success, but in enterprise software, not necessarily consumer products, and so they ultimately went with Jack Dorsey. It's a fun thought experiment to think like what would Twitter have looked like? Actually, a lot of people don't realize there's a decent chunk of Twitter's business that was related to the API into data-sharing and things like that, and maybe that would have become a much larger thing under someone like Andy Jassy, just given his background, but we'll never really know. They thought that Jack was the product guy that they needed and that's obviously in the direction that they went."", 'Deidre Woollard: Another alternative universe question I have for you is about when Disney and Salesforce were hovering around thinking about buying Twitter. Disney got pretty close, which I found surprising. I know that they, at one point, were thinking of almost buying BuzzFeed. What do you think Twitter would have been like if the deal went through with Disney, would it still exist?', ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I think it would have because the way that Disney was thinking about Twitter at that time was as a streaming service. A lot of people might not remember. But in 2016 when these conversations were happening, Twitter was really pushing into live video. They wanted to be like a TV on the internet. They were streaming Thursday Night Football games. They were making deals with all kinds of other content partners and that was what attracted Disney, was this idea that maybe they could take their catalog of high-quality content and get it to people through Twitter. You look at what Disney+ is right now, for example. It's possible that, that could have been like a role that Twitter played had this acquisition happened or in some way, maybe Twitter would have shifted and looked very different than it does today. But I do think it would have existed because the thing that Disney wanted it for is something that the company is still very much doing."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I find this fascinating with video because Twitter, they got it early on, they got it ahead of everybody, and they struggled with it. You've got the shutdown of Vine and Periscope. You've got these repeated mis-swings. You just talked about the Thursday Night Football. They keep building it, but then they keep not really being successful with it. What made this so hard to master for them?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, the execution was obviously poor. I think when you think about what the Vine, for those who might not remember Vine was this short, six-second looping video. The people who used it were very creative. There was a whole community and culture that had been built around Vine, and it was very reminiscent, or sorry, very similar, I should say, to what we now see with TikTok. Twitter at the time had TikTok in the building, but they didn't nail it, and the biggest I think issue that I gathered was around this time, they were doing three different video offerings at once. All three were led by different people."", ""All three were competing for resources internally, there was no real cohesive effort. They had Periscope, which was live video. They had this professional produced live stuff, the TV stuff we talked about with the NFL, and then they had Vine and there was just no cohesion between those three. They were competitive. This, in my opinion, is one of the biggest mistakes that Jack Dorsey made when he came back was not figuring out a way to bring this strategy together. As a result, even though they were early to a lot of these things, they didn't execute on them well enough to ultimately establish themselves, I guess, as the premier place for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: I feel like they didn't give it enough time, either, especially with Vine because what you just talked about, I mean, you had proto-influencers. You had people that were doing stunts and things like that. It was pretty sticky and Periscope was less so, but Vine was interesting."", ""Kurt Wagner: Well, and one of the big things I think with Vine is, I don't think they ever did enough to convince creators that that was worth their time. Imagine you're a young internet creator. You're creating these fun videos, you built an audience on Vine. Well, at a certain point, you're looking to make money. Twitter and Vine were not offering them the ways to make money that YouTube was, that Instagram would eventually go on to do. If you're someone who that is your livelihood, you're going to go to the place where you can make some money and so I think they were just too slow to recognize that, hey, we have this great community. We need to figure out how they can stay self-sustainable, and they just didn't pivot quick enough to do that for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, before Elon enters the room, we've got Elliott Investment Management. They pop up in the book. I've seen a lot of Elliott in the news lately. They've been looking at Crown Castle, which is a tower REIT I follow. They've been looking at Match, Phillips 66.\xa0What did you learn about Elliott's style by researching what they were doing with Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: It's a pretty simple style, which is what can we do to make the most money? They don't really worry a ton about the collateral damage. In Twitter's case it was, OK, we have this service that's incredibly popular, but we have a guy who's running it who has another full-time job like this just does not equate. Like the thought was, Twitter would simply be worth more money and would be more valuable if the person running it did it as a full-time job."", ""It's a hard thing to argue. Most companies of that size should have a full-time CEO, and so they came in with that mindset like, hey, it's nothing personal. Jack, we don't dislike you as a person But the fact that you're running two jobs, it hurts the value of this company and we need to figure that out. I really liked this chapter and I really liked to digging in on this because it was a really fascinating business clash to watch this activist investor try and boot the CEO from the company while the board of directors is actively fighting to keep him. Ultimately, I would say the board won in the short term, Jack got to keep his job."", 'They had to make a bunch of I guess, concessions to Elliott in order for that to happen. But in the long term, I think Elliott actually got what they wanted, which was they got a much more focused company. They got some very specific goals around the business, around user growth, around revenue, things like that, that Twitter had never had to do before. Ultimately, Jack Dorsey left the company about 18 months later, and I think a big reason was that this had burnt him out and this had really bothered him. Even though he got to keep his job short-term, I think Elliot got what they wanted in the long term, which was that full-time CEO for Twitter.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned that it was nothing personal, but he took it personally and I think that's something that he has in common with Elon Musk, is this idea of taking business things really personally. So the relationship between them is interesting and we knew that Musk loves Twitter, but the relationship between Musk and Dorsey I found really interesting in the book because it gives us a good flavor that there's a mutual admiration society there. But then it seems like there's been less of that over time. So I think I see some of the ways that they're similar but tell me a little bit about where they're similar and where they differ."", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll start with the differences because I think they're more striking. I think the way that these two choose to manage and lead is very different. Jack was very thoughtful, almost to a fault. He was generally slow. He was hands-off. He didn't like to make a ton of decisions. He'd like to empower the people who reported him to do that. He served as an advisor, if you will. Then Elon is the exact opposite. He runs a million miles per hour. He makes all the decisions himself. He doesn't necessarily care too much about the feelings of his employees. He's just working toward his ultimate mission and if you get in the way, you either run with him or you get run over. So I think from a management standpoint, they were incredibly different."", ""Where I think they were similar is that I think jack had this idealistic vision for Twitter about what it could be or maybe should be, if it wasn't a publicly traded company and I think Elon bought into that or agreed with that. I think where they met was like, OK, we manage things differently. We treat people differently, but our vision for what Twitter could be or should be is the same and that's where they shook hands and seemed to be on the same page. Now, obviously, I don't think that's materialized in the way that certainly Jack Dorsey had envisioned but I think there's also something to be said about being rich and being a founder. It's a small crew, it's a small social circle of billionaire tech founders. So I think sometimes people who are in that circles gravitate toward one another simply because there's very few people in the world who can relate to what they go through, what their life is like, and I'm sure that there was some of that as well."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about when he comes in. He comes into this company, he brings a sink in the building, it's all nuts. It's like a how-not-to, because there's layoffs, there's chaos, there's a climate of fear, there's just bad communication, there's threats. Is there any positive lessons that we can learn from the general disaster that happens when he decides to take over?"", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll maybe give him two, I don't even know if they're compliments, but I'll maybe say there's two things that maybe were on the right track at least to start. The one is like when you take over a company like this, being very dramatic in terms of your changes, I actually think is an OK thing to do. Twitter was in a rut. It had spent a long summer as we've talked about with the lawsuit and all these things and I think the idea of coming in and really trying to be radically different is actually OK. I don't think he executed on this idea very well, but I think in theory, being radically different wasn't necessarily a bad idea. The other thing that I think he did or at least the intentions were there to do, was he moves very fast."", ""Twitter had a history of moving very slowly, of second-guessing themselves, of taking forever to launch things and this idea that Elon had came in and wanted to move quickly and was willing to literally sleep at the office to get things done, set it set that example for people. I don't think that's healthy work-life balance by any stretch, but I do think there's something to be said about his willingness to move fast in the tech world can be somewhat commendable sometimes. Now, again, I don't think he executed either these things very well. I think he didn't really have a set plan when he came in and then the moving too quickly actually got them into more trouble because there was no plan that he was following. But I think on paper, those two things could have been positives had they been handled a little bit differently."", ""Deidre Woollard: The new X, it's a different place. I've been on there, I think I joined Twitter in like 2008. I tried to move on, I'm trying -- I've tried Threads, Jack Dorsey's got Bluesky. Nothing has quite measured up so far. So is Twitter like a time-and-place phenomenon, do you think? Or is there room for the next big short message social media service? If so, do you see anything? What are you using? Are you still on Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I am still on Twitter. Now X, of course. I like to think that I'm mostly there because I cover the company, but to be honest, I still do get some real value out of it. I'm a big sports fan and like the sports news and sports community on Twitter, I think is one of the things that has actually been able to stay somewhat strong. But I've been thinking a lot about this, like can Twitter be replicated? I'm not so sure that it can, for a couple of reasons. No. 1, the thing that made Twitter so unique and great was that pretty much everyone felt that they needed to be on it in terms of celebrity. So if you're a politician, if you're a musician, if you're a journalist, if you're a celebrity of some kind, there was this feeling that you had to be on Twitter because that's where people talked about things in public. I'm not sure you could convince that collection of people that they need to be anywhere in 2024 or beyond."", ""I think we've gotten to this point in social media where people, 10-15 years ago thought it was a necessity. Now people have realized, well, there are pros and cons of social media, but it's not something I have to do. So that's what to me made Twitter so unique was like the collection of people who you could hear from, quite frankly, on a regular basis. I just don't think you could convince all those people to come back and then as a result, you're never going to have that community in one place again. I think we're seeing that right now with how things are starting to splinter. As you mentioned, Threads or Bluesky or even Instagram. Obviously, it's not Twitter, but it's a place where I think people have migrated or said like, OK, I don't have my Twitter anymore. I'll focus on Instagram instead. So it's hard for me to imagine all those groups coming back together in one place again."", ""Ron Gross: Coming up after the break, Emily Flippen and Andy Cross return with a couple of stocks on their radar.

What do you got?"", ""Emily Flippen: The stock on my radar this week is Grab. The ticker is G-R-A-B. For investors who are unfamiliar, Grab is based out of Southeast Asia. It operates a little bit like Uber Eats or Grubhub, where they have mobility, they have transportation, delivery, logistics. A one-stop shop of sorts. They came out and they posted their first ever quarterly profit this quarter, fourth quarter 2023. They also approved a $500 million share repurchase plan, which is really interesting. The company doesn't have absurd stock-based compensation, but it does have a ton of cash on its balance sheet. So what they're saying is effectively, well, in the meantime, while we figure out what to do with this cash, why not reward some shareholders through share repurchases? What I'm continuing to watch, though, is just how they manage their incentive payments to drive expansion in both active customers and the number of orders. They've had a 12% increase in transacting users over the last quarter, which is great. But I want to see those incentive payments continue to come down."", 'Andy Cross: Dan, you got a question about Grab?', ""Dan Boyd: So I'd never heard of this stock before Emily brought it to the show. I was looking it up and I still don't really understand what they do. Emily, could you give us a quick primer?"", 'Emily Flippen: Have you have you gotten an Uber before? Have you ordered Grubhub or Uber Eats? Have you sent a package to somebody you love? There you go. You got Grab.', ""Ron Gross: I'm still not sure what they do. Andy, you're up. What are you looking at?"", ""Andy Cross: Team, I'm looking at HubSpot, H-U-B-S, a subscription CRM tool, customer relationship management to more than 205,000 customers who rely on that tool, especially small, medium-sized businesses, $30 billion company, $600 stock price. The stock's up 55% in the past year. It's growing about 25% and sells for about 14 times multiple on those sales. What's really interesting is they have recently announced a new pricing scheme. So they provide these hubs that around operations, content management, customer service for these clients, sales of the big usage of them. They are now doing a new pricing plan that removes some of the seat limitations.\xa0It's easier to upgrade, aligns the pricing with some of the new CRM tools and some of the new AI stuff there they're inputting for. So that's going to hit in March, so I'm really watching to see how that impacts both their subscriber base as well as some of their revenue numbers."", 'Ron Gross: Dan?', ""Dan Boyd: So this company, they don't make hubcaps?"", 'Andy Cross: They do not make hubcaps.

The higher prices come as reports suggest OPEC may extend production cuts.', ""PIMCO Portfolio Manager Greg Sharenow joins Yahoo Finance to discuss OPEC's tightening of the market against a backdrop of Middle East tension."", 'Domestic concerns such as the election of Donald Trump may also impact the broader oil market, Sharenow adds: ""I think it\'s less impact on US markets and more geopolitical consideration. If Trump is elected, then stepping away from support for Ukraine...Over the course of the last few months, Ukraine has successfully attacked several Russian energy assets. Would they ultimately end up doing more?... Similarly, I would expect more aggressive sanctioning policy and more pressure applied to Iran.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Oil prices hitting $80 a barrel. That's for the first time since November. Joining us now to discuss, Greg Sharenow who leads PIMCO's commodity portfolio management group."", ""Greg, thank you so much for being here with us. I know that you anticipate that oil is 15% below your broader target more broadly. I'm curious, what do you see as the biggest catalyst forward for oil then?"", ""GREG SHARENOW: Provided OPEC continues to take the action that they have done for much of the last two years in supporting the market via reducing supplies, which has kept inventories very low, we continue to think that in this environment, we are going to draw inventories over the course of 2024. And that is one reason why we think we're going to have higher prices. In addition to that, one thing that's making OPEC more successful this time than, let's say, four years ago is the capital discipline has started to increase among US and Canadian oil and gas producers."", ""So relative to $80 three years ago, they're spending meaningfully less than they would have spent. As a result, we expect growth, which has been a positive surprise in 2023, to start meaningfully decelerating over the course of '24. And that's going to allow them ultimately to bring on more supplies. But for now, they're able to effectively keep the market tight and prices support it."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And so, Greg, just to put a fine point on it here, OPEC is meeting soon and you do think that they will continue to maintain the production cuts that they have had thus far. If that does happen, then what gets oil-- sort of what's the catalyst for the next leg up? Is it the confirmation of that or does something else need to happen?"", ""GREG SHARENOW: To be honest, I think it's a continuation of low inventories that are going to potentially draw further. You're starting to see the market term structure or the premium for prompt delivery accelerate. You know, the front Brent contract is now 11%, 12% above one year forward."", ""That's historically a fairly high level, suggesting that inventories, and it's consistent with inventories, being very low. So, if OPEC decides to start bringing oil back onto the market, that will help reduce some of the tightness. But in many respects, it's also a positive sign because the oil is needed. You know, ironically, cutting supplies to stop a market from being weak is not nearly as good as when you actually get to increase supplies into a strong market."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: I want to talk about domestic risks a little bit. Obviously, we're heading towards another presidential election. If former President Trump were to take office, what could that do to the oil market?"", ""GREG SHARENOW: Well, I think it's actually less impact on US markets and more geopolitical consideration. What does-- if Trump is elected, then stepping away from support for Ukraine potentially due to Ukraine's decision on their own security and their own defense. Over the course of the last few months, Ukraine has successfully attacked several Russian energy assets."", ""And would they ultimately end up doing more if they view that as an existential threat, that they have to take that action? Which maybe today, they'd be more concerned about doing because of the required support from the US government and European leaders who are sensitive to inflation. Similarly, I would expect more aggressive sanctioning policy and more pressure applied to Iran."", ""We've seen that in 2019 when the extreme pressure was put on to them. They actually were successfully able to attack Saudi energy infrastructure, which, at that time, was remarkable how fast Saudi was able to recover. But was that a warning as much as a complete attempt? And in addition to that, we've seen the efficacy of the Houthis in disrupting shipping. Iran has a similar capability of doing really disruptive activity."", ""And maybe the analog from looking in the '80s when the US and other countries were able to successfully keep the waterways open, now might actually be much more challenging given the use of drones and other military equipment that have come on that can make it harder to do that. So I think that there's real risks in a Trump presidency, that actually geopolitics get less stable and, as a result, potentially more constructive for oil."", ""JULIE HYMAN: That's really interesting and something that we haven't heard as many people talk about, Greg. Does that then, in turn-- if that does happen, one could imagine a scenario in which a theoretical President Trump would be alarmed, right, at seeing higher oil prices that would not necessarily be good for him domestically if that translates into higher prices at the pump in the US."", ""Could that-- and again, this is-- I'm sort of going several steps into conjecture here. But it would tend to be probably more reactive than proactive on that front. So, you know, how would that play out?"", ""GREG SHARENOW: Well, I think the first thing he does is he calls on Saudi Arabia, which has managed to take off meaningful amount of supply from the market, who has roughly 3 million barrels per day of excess capacity. And in that case, ask them to bring on more supplies. Now Saudi Arabia has the East-West pipelines that allow them to redirect some supplies. But certainly, you have to make that calculus. I've made a statement that I think Iran will respond. He may have a different view on exactly what Iran will do in that situation and, as a result, may make that decision. And then the minute he makes that decision, if Iran responds, he got to start calling on allies to try to replace it. Question is, how disruptive will it be? And that will be impacted by how much-- that will impact how much the Allies can actually help.""]"

(NYSE:OMC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Omnicom Group's shares on or after the 8th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 9th of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.80 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Omnicom Group has a trailing yield of 3.2% on the current share price of US$88.44. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Omnicom Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Omnicom Group paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 42% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that Omnicom Group's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Omnicom Group, with earnings per share up 3.7% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share growth in recent times has not been a standout. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Omnicom Group has delivered an average of 5.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", 'From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Omnicom Group? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Omnicom Group is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Omnicom Group is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.', 'Wondering what the future holds for Omnicom Group?

As concern grows around AI systems' potential for harmful biases, misleading output, and black-box decision-making, IBM's approach inspires a deeper trust."", 'The long-term contracts Big Blue signs with enterprise-class customers will depend on that professional-grade trust. ""Hallucinations"" and data mishaps are common themes in today\'s large language models (LLMs), but IBM isn\'t interested in playing that game. The likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet don\'t seem ready to compete from the transparency and quality angle so far.', 'Critics might argue that IBM\'s ""slow and steady"" approach is a disadvantage. But in the realm of enterprise solutions, patience and thoroughness should be seen as strengths. The slow and heavy vetting IBM\'s prospective clients apply to the Watson AI systems today will result in lucrative, hard-to-replace, multiyear contracts.', '""The early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said in the recent fourth-quarter earnings call.', ""Moreover, IBM's current valuation presents a potential value opportunity compared to some of the AI market's highfliers. The stock trades at a modest 2.7 times sales and 13 times free cash flow, making even Alphabet look expensive in comparison with the same ratios clocking in at 5.6 and 25, respectively."", ""If the company can continue to prove that its AI solutions add tangible, measurable value to businesses, investors who focus on long-term potential may find IBM to be the unsung workhorse of the AI revolution. If nothing else, you're looking at a generous dividend payer with torrential cash flows and a centennial business history."", 'IBM\'s big AI bet is starting to pay off right now, but even if the business-grade AI strategy fizzles, it\'s still a great income-generating stock to own in the long run. That\'s a big ""if,"" though. AI and hybrid cloud computing have emerged as leading growth drivers for the ultra-experienced tech giant. I expect good things and big wins from Big Blue\'s AI business in the coming years.', 'Billy Duberstein (Cloudflare): The past 18 months in artificial intelligence have been all about training, which is the act of building extremely large language models out of billions of data parameters. But now the AI industry is moving to an ""if you build it, they will come"" phase. In layman\'s terms, companies are now actually putting these models to work.', ""When a trained model is prompted and then goes to work on finding answers or completing a task, that's called inferencing. And inferencing applications are about to take off."", ""To see how that shift is unfolding, look no further than Nvidia's recent earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang said he estimates about 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue over the past year was actually for inference, not training. That's somewhat surprising, as Nvidia is thought to be the only game in town for training, whereas it's possible inferencing could be done with some lower-power processors from competitors."", 'One company that could be an under-the-radar inference play is Cloudflare, which began as a software company that helped speed up websites, software applications, and content delivery.', ""But Cloudflare's management was forward-thinking, taking the time and cost to build an integrated software stack from the beginning, whereby all of its new products and services can be run on the same type of commodity hardware. That has paid off in the form of an ever-increasing portfolio of products, including cybersecurity, network management, and developer platforms that run on its lightweight servers in internet service provider data centers close to customers at the edge."", 'Today, Cloudflare\'s servers are in 310 cities in over 120 countries connecting 13,000 networks, with its network now within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the world\'s population. And that makes Cloudflare a potentially ideal place for businesses to run their inference workloads. That\'s because inference workloads are likely too computing-intense to run on end devices such as PCs or phones, but are likely ""lightweight"" enough so that they don\'t have to be run all the way back in a large, cloud-based data center.', ""Management began to capitalize on this potential last September when Cloudflare released Workers AI, an inferencing-as-a-service platform for developers in Cloudflare's servers, which could potentially put Cloudflare up against the big cloud computing players for inference workloads."", ""And the new offering is showing early signs of success, with Workers AI requests growing 9x between September and December, according to Cloudflare's recent fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. And even though the new inference offering just came out and contributes little to revenues today, Cloudflare still saw a very healthy 32% revenue growth in the last quarter, driven by its core products. Of note, Cloudflare is really penetrating larger enterprise customers now, with the company recording its largest customer win, as well as its largest customer renewal ever last quarter."", ""With much-loved offerings across its core content delivery, network, and cybersecurity markets that are still growing strong, Cloudflare's new inference products could bolster its already-strong growth rate for years to come."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): After a couple of years of unwinding out-of-control spending that cropped up during the pandemic, customer data and relationship management platform Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is totally back. The software giant reported revenue growth of 11% this past year, despite a big slowdown in corporate spending as companies looked to tighten up as the economy slowed. Salesforce is predicting some of this soft spending among its users will continue, but is still nevertheless predicting revenue growth of about 9% for 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Salesforce).', 'As the business has matured, Salesforce made a quick pivot from all-out growth (it had been putting up 20%-plus sales growth for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock over the last two decades) to a more value-generating business. CEO Marc Benioff and the top team ratcheted up generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit margins this last year to 14.4%, and expects that figure to jump to 20.4% for full-year fiscal 2025.', ""Along the way, Salesforce started repurchasing its own stock as part of a new strategy to begin returning cash to shareholders. And starting this year, Salesforce will also begin paying a quarterly dividend -- which, as of this writing, is worth 0.5% in annualized yield. That's not too exciting, but it nevertheless signals this data management software company's successful evolution into a more mature business."", ""Of course, customer data is more important than ever in a new era of AI-fueled computing technology. Salesforce's own development of AI throughout its platform isn't translating into any pick-up in growth just yet. However, that tees up the possibility of management underpromising and overdelivering this year on financial guidance. Plus, Benioff and company said its own internal use of its AI tools should fuel the profit margin expansion story for years to come."", ""Salesforce stock now trades for about 45 times expected GAAP earnings per share (EPS), or about 30 times EPS on an adjusted basis (which corresponds a bit more closely to free cash flow). Shares have been on a hot run in the last year, but there are still years' worth of profitable returns left in the tank for this cloud software leader.

The top four AI stocks by position size represent nearly half the total portfolio!"", ""So, feast your eyes on Buffett's top four AI stocks:"", ""Warren Buffett isn't afraid to let a winning investment become a large piece of Berkshire's portfolio. Look no further than iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The stock, which Buffett first bought in 2016, has grown to 44.2% of the portfolio. Nonetheless, Apple is a bonafide AI stock, and Buffett has only sold minimal shares despite sitting on tremendous unrealized gains today. Why? Buffett has credited fierce customer loyalty, quipping that people would give up their second car for an iPhone."", ""Tech companies, Apple included, are investing in AI and combining it with their consumer-facing products. Apple has already implemented AI into the iOS experience for creature comforts, like Siri assistance, facial recognition, content recommendations, and more. However, Tim Cook recently shared at an event that Apple is prioritizing investments in generative AI. It recently shut down its electric car project and will shift employee resources to Apple's AI division. Buckle up for the future."", ""Corporate credit and analytics firm Moody's (NYSE: MCO) is more similar to Buffett's known style. Berkshire has owned Moody's stock since 2000, and it has been a very successful investment over the years. It's a much smaller piece of Berkshire's portfolio at 2.5%, but then again, Moody's is a much smaller company than Apple. Berkshire's stake represents 13.5% ownership in the company."", ""Moody's analyzes data to rate corporate credit and sell market research. Artificial intelligence is a natural progression for a company like Moody's. The business possesses invaluable data from decades of operations and uses OpenAI and Azure to build models for that data. Moody's evolution to more tech-driven data analytics is critical to maintaining its stellar reputation in the financial markets. Moody's has grown revenue for 64 consecutive quarters, a testament to the company's durability."", ""Tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock Buffett got into late; he didn't add shares to Berkshire's portfolio until 2019. However, the stock has more than doubled since then, showing that it's hardly ever too late to invest in great businesses. Amazon has built a reputation as an innovator. After becoming the dominant e-commerce company in America, Amazon has since built a leading cloud platform and streaming service and is now leaning into AI."", ""Like Apple, Amazon is using generative AI in its consumer-facing businesses. E-commerce customers can view a product, and AI will summarize buyers' product reviews into shortened summaries to save time. In AWS, Amazon is amassing massive resources, including Nvidia chips and its own, to give cloud customers the tools to build AI applications. Amazon's ability to tie AI into its business could support long-term growth in e-commerce and cloud -- industries with gas left in the tank."", ""Data cloud and analytics company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is a unique Buffett AI stock in that it's the only one Berkshire Hathaway has been invested in since day one. The holding company participated in Snowflake's public offering in 2020 and has held the stock since. It's also the smallest position of the companies on this list and represents just 0.3% of Berkshire's portfolio."", ""Snowflake could become an enormous company in the AI era. The company's cloud platform stores and organizes data, allowing customers to easily search and integrate it with third-party apps, all through the cloud. Additionally, Snowflake operates a data marketplace where customers can share data and buy access to third-party data sets to combine with their own."", ""Data is fundamentally the building block of AI as it's all trained on data. That makes Snowflake a potentially crucial party to AI moving forward, and it's noteworthy that Berkshire jumped into the stock early."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Whether the AI market darlings deserve their rich valuations or not, three Fool.com contributors believe it's time to look beyond the usual suspects."", 'They put their heads together to uncover existing tech giants like International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Cloudflare (NYSE: NET), and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM)\xa0-- three great companies with deep AI expertise. This trio offers compelling value and potentially significant long-term returns from their AI initiatives.', ""Investing is a marathon. IBM, Salesforce, and Cloudflare have been running the AI race for years, and they won't stop anytime soon."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): Generative AI tools and flashy consumer tech often dominate the headlines. Meanwhile, good old tech titan IBM is quietly positioning itself as the backbone of enterprise-grade AI solutions.', ""The company's hybrid cloud focus, emphasis on explainability and trackable data sources, and deep industry relationships might not seem as sexy as the latest ChatGPT upgrade, but these are the very elements that should make IBM an enduring force in the AI space."", ""IBM's focus on long-term partnerships and sustainable solutions aligns with the needs of businesses wanting to use AI in an impactful yet responsible way. As concern grows around AI systems' potential for harmful biases, misleading output, and black-box decision-making, IBM's approach inspires a deeper trust."", 'The long-term contracts Big Blue signs with enterprise-class customers will depend on that professional-grade trust. ""Hallucinations"" and data mishaps are common themes in today\'s large language models (LLMs), but IBM isn\'t interested in playing that game. The likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet don\'t seem ready to compete from the transparency and quality angle so far.', 'Critics might argue that IBM\'s ""slow and steady"" approach is a disadvantage. But in the realm of enterprise solutions, patience and thoroughness should be seen as strengths. The slow and heavy vetting IBM\'s prospective clients apply to the Watson AI systems today will result in lucrative, hard-to-replace, multiyear contracts.', '""The early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said in the recent fourth-quarter earnings call.', ""Moreover, IBM's current valuation presents a potential value opportunity compared to some of the AI market's highfliers. The stock trades at a modest 2.7 times sales and 13 times free cash flow, making even Alphabet look expensive in comparison with the same ratios clocking in at 5.6 and 25, respectively."", ""If the company can continue to prove that its AI solutions add tangible, measurable value to businesses, investors who focus on long-term potential may find IBM to be the unsung workhorse of the AI revolution. If nothing else, you're looking at a generous dividend payer with torrential cash flows and a centennial business history."", 'IBM\'s big AI bet is starting to pay off right now, but even if the business-grade AI strategy fizzles, it\'s still a great income-generating stock to own in the long run. That\'s a big ""if,"" though. AI and hybrid cloud computing have emerged as leading growth drivers for the ultra-experienced tech giant. I expect good things and big wins from Big Blue\'s AI business in the coming years.', 'Billy Duberstein (Cloudflare): The past 18 months in artificial intelligence have been all about training, which is the act of building extremely large language models out of billions of data parameters. But now the AI industry is moving to an ""if you build it, they will come"" phase. In layman\'s terms, companies are now actually putting these models to work.', ""When a trained model is prompted and then goes to work on finding answers or completing a task, that's called inferencing. And inferencing applications are about to take off."", ""To see how that shift is unfolding, look no further than Nvidia's recent earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang said he estimates about 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue over the past year was actually for inference, not training. That's somewhat surprising, as Nvidia is thought to be the only game in town for training, whereas it's possible inferencing could be done with some lower-power processors from competitors."", 'One company that could be an under-the-radar inference play is Cloudflare, which began as a software company that helped speed up websites, software applications, and content delivery.', ""But Cloudflare's management was forward-thinking, taking the time and cost to build an integrated software stack from the beginning, whereby all of its new products and services can be run on the same type of commodity hardware. That has paid off in the form of an ever-increasing portfolio of products, including cybersecurity, network management, and developer platforms that run on its lightweight servers in internet service provider data centers close to customers at the edge."", 'Today, Cloudflare\'s servers are in 310 cities in over 120 countries connecting 13,000 networks, with its network now within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the world\'s population. And that makes Cloudflare a potentially ideal place for businesses to run their inference workloads. That\'s because inference workloads are likely too computing-intense to run on end devices such as PCs or phones, but are likely ""lightweight"" enough so that they don\'t have to be run all the way back in a large, cloud-based data center.', ""Management began to capitalize on this potential last September when Cloudflare released Workers AI, an inferencing-as-a-service platform for developers in Cloudflare's servers, which could potentially put Cloudflare up against the big cloud computing players for inference workloads."", ""And the new offering is showing early signs of success, with Workers AI requests growing 9x between September and December, according to Cloudflare's recent fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. And even though the new inference offering just came out and contributes little to revenues today, Cloudflare still saw a very healthy 32% revenue growth in the last quarter, driven by its core products. Of note, Cloudflare is really penetrating larger enterprise customers now, with the company recording its largest customer win, as well as its largest customer renewal ever last quarter."", ""With much-loved offerings across its core content delivery, network, and cybersecurity markets that are still growing strong, Cloudflare's new inference products could bolster its already-strong growth rate for years to come."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): After a couple of years of unwinding out-of-control spending that cropped up during the pandemic, customer data and relationship management platform Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is totally back. The software giant reported revenue growth of 11% this past year, despite a big slowdown in corporate spending as companies looked to tighten up as the economy slowed. Salesforce is predicting some of this soft spending among its users will continue, but is still nevertheless predicting revenue growth of about 9% for 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Salesforce).', 'As the business has matured, Salesforce made a quick pivot from all-out growth (it had been putting up 20%-plus sales growth for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock over the last two decades) to a more value-generating business. CEO Marc Benioff and the top team ratcheted up generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit margins this last year to 14.4%, and expects that figure to jump to 20.4% for full-year fiscal 2025.', ""Along the way, Salesforce started repurchasing its own stock as part of a new strategy to begin returning cash to shareholders. And starting this year, Salesforce will also begin paying a quarterly dividend -- which, as of this writing, is worth 0.5% in annualized yield. That's not too exciting, but it nevertheless signals this data management software company's successful evolution into a more mature business."", ""Of course, customer data is more important than ever in a new era of AI-fueled computing technology. Salesforce's own development of AI throughout its platform isn't translating into any pick-up in growth just yet. However, that tees up the possibility of management underpromising and overdelivering this year on financial guidance. Plus, Benioff and company said its own internal use of its AI tools should fuel the profit margin expansion story for years to come."", ""Salesforce stock now trades for about 45 times expected GAAP earnings per share (EPS), or about 30 times EPS on an adjusted basis (which corresponds a bit more closely to free cash flow). Shares have been on a hot run in the last year, but there are still years' worth of profitable returns left in the tank for this cloud software leader. I'm happy to keep holding."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

Now, just months later, market watchers are debating whether it's too late to buy the stock. Indeed, Arm Holdings has delivered 176% returns (as of market close on Thursday) since its late September initial public offering (IPO), more than 13 times the returns of the S&P 500."", ""Make no mistake -- it's the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that has sparked those gains. Arm's central processing units (CPUs) are found in a wide variety of electronic devices, including personal computers, tablets, smartphones, thermostats, drones, and smart TVs. However, its CPUs are also the gold standard, helping to run hyperscale computers, data centers, and cloud infrastructure services. It's this last group that represents the most compelling opportunity."", ""What does all this mean for investors who sat out Arm's recent run? Should they buy the stock now in the hope of additional upside or simply look elsewhere due to the company's frothy valuation? Let's dig in to see what the evidence reveals."", ""While Arm conducted its (most recent) IPO just five months ago, the company has a long and distinguished history in the tech world. The British semiconductor company was founded in 1990. Just a few years later, management revised Arm's business model. Rather than make processors, the company focused on licensing the intellectual property (IP) it developed."", ""That move was prescient. By offering licenses to all comers, Arm reached the scale necessary to make its licenses more cost-effective for customers than their own in-house development. Arm's chip designs quickly became the go-to processors powering mobile phones, eventually capturing an eye-catching 99% of the market."", 'The company went public on both the London and Nasdaq stock exchanges in 1998 before being taken private by SoftBank in late 2016. By then, the company was a household name in tech circles. Fast forward to late 2020, and chipmaker Nvidia made an offer to buy Arm for $40 billion before the deal was quashed by regulators. Late last year, SoftBank decided to spin off Arm while retaining a roughly 91% stake in the company.', 'And the rest, as they say, is history.', ""Lest there be any doubt, it's the rapid adoption of generative AI that represents Arm's biggest opportunity. While graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia do much of the heavy lifting, they're not alone. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines the capabilities of CPUs and GPUs working in unison, contains 144 of Arm's latest version 9 (V9) CPU cores. Nvidia isn't the only one: Microsoft designed a new AI server chip that incorporates more than 100 Arm cores."", ""The use of AI is spreading like wildfire as companies scramble to leverage the productivity gains these advanced algorithms offer. The strong demand helped boost Arm's recent financial results. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter, Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, while record royalty revenue climbed 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 32% to $0.29."", ""Yet that only tells part of the story. Arm's remaining performance obligation -- a forward-looking sales indicator -- grew 38% year over year, suggesting Arm's growth spurt will accelerate. As the adoption of AI grows, so too will Arm's fortunes."", 'Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann argues that the ""shift to accelerated computing ... for generative AI models"" will spark an upgrade cycle in the data center space. With an installed base of roughly $1 trillion, that\'s a lot of CPU cores, with Arm a primary beneficiary.', ""There's no clear consensus about the economic impact of AI, but everyone agrees the potential is massive. A report by Goldman Sachs suggests AI will boost labor productivity, driving a 7% or $7 trillion increase in global GDP. Morgan Stanley came in a close second at $6 trillion."", ""Whatever the total market ends up being, Arm's IP will be at the heart of this shift in the technological landscape, making the company a major player in the space."", ""There's no question that Arm's price tag is steep -- that is, when using the most popular valuation metrics. For example, the stock is selling for 1,874 times earnings (not a typo) and 50 times sales. Unfortunately, those metrics don't take into account Arm's current growth spurt. However, when measured using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which factors in its growth trajectory -- it sells for less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock."", ""Given the magnitude of the opportunity and its place in the industry, it's not too late to buy Arm stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.17 = US$7.0b ÷ (US$49b - US$8.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Netflix has an ROCE of 17%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10.0% generated by the Entertainment industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""In the above chart we have measured Netflix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Netflix ."", ""The trends we've noticed at Netflix are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 17%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 105%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Netflix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital."", ""In summary, it's great to see that Netflix can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with a respectable 77% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist."", 'While Netflix looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Despite the pandemic pulling forward demand, customer gains have been fairly consistent."", ""Netflix was able to scale up so rapidly on the back of broadband internet penetration, as well as the cord-cutting trend. Consumers find better value and convenience in streaming TV, a shift that the management team realized early on. According to CFO Spence Neumann, there are 1 billion broadband-enabled households worldwide (outside of China, where Netflix isn't available), providing a massive opportunity for the growth to continue."", ""While Netflix's business model of creating or acquiring content and distributing it over the internet hasn't changed, what has evolved is the leadership team's strategy. Netflix has not only cracked down on password sharers but also introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier, both moves that have boosted subscriber numbers in recent quarters."", 'In order to achieve monumental growth, it was and still is required of Netflix to spend huge amounts, tens of billions of dollars per year, on content to create greater choices for its viewers. Consequently, the bears were convinced that Netflix would never be able to stop burning cash.', ""Things have changed thanks to Netflix's scale, represented by $34 billion of revenue in 2023. The company reported positive free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion in 2022 and $6.9 billion last year. In 2024, executives forecast FCF to total $6 billion."", 'This is an extremely encouraging development because it means Netflix no longer needs to access the capital markets to fund its operations. This is despite the fact that $17 billion will be spent on content this year. Netflix is able to spread out these fixed costs over a bigger user base than any of its rivals, which gives it an advantage in the industry.', 'The business has even started to return capital to shareholders.

Netflix is getting close to saturation in its most mature markets, the U.S. and Canada. Competition is only going to intensify. And because this is a much larger company nowadays, the days of greater than 20% sales growth are likely a thing of the past."", ""But thanks to an expanding bottom line, shares don't look outrageously expensive.

Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Public Service Enterprise Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Public Service Enterprise Group's payout ratio is modest, at just 44% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out an unsustainably high 236% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Our definition of free cash flow excludes cash generated from asset sales, so since Public Service Enterprise Group is paying out such a high percentage of its cash flow, it might be worth seeing if it sold assets or had similar events that might have led to such a high dividend payment."", ""While Public Service Enterprise Group's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Public Service Enterprise Group's ability to maintain its dividend."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Public Service Enterprise Group's earnings per share have been growing at 12% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Public Service Enterprise Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.2% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth."", ""Is Public Service Enterprise Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're glad to see the company has been improving its earnings per share while also paying out a low percentage of income. However, it's not great to see it paying out what we see as an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Public Service Enterprise Group from a dividend perspective."", ""In light of that, while Public Service Enterprise Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Public Service Enterprise Group (2 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""We have to calculate the value of NextEra Energy slightly differently to other stocks because it is a electric utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%. Relative to the current share price of US$55.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NextEra Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024. ', 'The stock market of 2024 is driven by the same trends that saw investors glued to their screens in 2023. The primary themes in the market right now are artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, with the final week of February providing investors with key data points and news on both fronts.', ""Before we get to the news, it's important to see how large cap stocks are fairing these days. These stocks are typically sizeable, mature, and established companies that command strong market positions along with comforting balance sheets. Like other stocks, their performance is also tied to the stock market, and large cap stocks typically attract investors during economic downturns or shaky conditions as they offer comfort with their ability to hedge against major losses."", 'Diving deeper into large cap stocks, these can be divided either along their industries or their fundamentals to further fine tune any performance expectations. Large cap stocks in stable sectors such as consumer defensive, the likes of the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) or the consumer goods behemoth Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are sizeable entities whose global brand following enables investors to rest in comfort knowing that even if the stock and revenue are down in a recession, both will pick up ones the economic winds become more favorable.', 'On the flip side, large cap stocks belonging to high risk sectors such as biotechnology are significantly vulnerable to market whims as well as any whiff that investors might get about potential troubles. For instance, consider the large cap biotechnology stocks Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). These two stocks are household names due to their coronavirus vaccine, but despite being multi billion dollar firms, the shares have painted quite an eye watering performance if we consider their performance over the course of the past couple of years.', ""In fact, the risky nature of these large cap stock industries means that investors have to be on constant watch out for any headwinds that could affect business performance. For Moderna, this came in the form of a report in February 2024 that its vaccine for a respiratory virus had demonstrated reduced efficacy. The shares tumbled 7% on that day, and overall, the stock is down 22% year to date, proving that just because a stock is a large cap does not mean that it will always remain stable. Similarly, BioNTech's stock is down by nearly 15% during its latest earnings report that saw the firm stress that it would return to growth in 2025 after it scales up oncology products to mitigate the effects of a bottoming out of its COVID vaccine market."", ""So, with some drivers of large cap stock performance out of the way, let's focus on the news before a brief primer on value stocks. The tail end of February 2024 has seen large cap artificial intelligence stock Synopsys, Inc.

The foundation of my strategy is to make investments that produce an increasing stream of passive income.

', ""This month, I plan to buy a few more shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA). Here's why I believe they will help me on my steady march toward financial independence."", ""Chevron pays a 4.3%-yielding dividend. That's triple the 1.4% yield of the S&P 500. "", 'The oil giant has done an exceptional job increasing its dividend over the years. It delivered its 37th straight year of dividend growth in 2024, boosting its payment by another 8%. That continued its strong dividend growth rate. It has expanded its payout faster than the S&P 500 over the last five years and at more than double the rate of its closest peer. ', ""Chevron should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend. The company's high-return capital program will drive 10%-plus annual free cash flow growth through 2027, assuming oil averages around $60 a barrel (well below the current price in the high $70s). That would give it the funds to invest in high-return capital projects, boost its dividend, and buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range (enough to repurchase 3% of its outstanding shares at the current price). It could buy back shares at the top end of that range when crude is over $70 a barrel (enough to retire 6% of its outstanding shares each year). Meanwhile, Chevron's pending acquisition of Hess has the potential to enhance and extend its growth outlook. Finally, while oil and gas are the company's main fuel source, it's investing in several lower-carbon energy businesses to drive its future expansion. "", ""Brookfield Renewable's dividend yield is currently around 6%. The renewable energy giant has delivered at least 5% annual dividend growth for the past 13 years. That should continue, with Brookfield aiming to increase its payout by 5% to 9% annually over the long term. "", ""The company should have ample power to deliver on that goal. Brookfield's existing power purchase agreements contain inflation escalators that should grow its funds from operations (FFO) per share by 2% to 3% per year. Meanwhile, margin enhancement activities should add another 2% to 4% annually. On top of that, Brookfield has a massive pipeline of development projects that should power another 3% to 5% in annual FFO-per-share expansion. Those organic drivers alone can support its dividend growth target. "", 'Acquisitions could push its FFO growth rate above 10% annually. The company routinely recycles capital (selling mature assets to fund higher-return new investments) to enhance its ability to make acquisitions. It agreed to deploy $2 billion last year on deals that will supply it with increasing streams of cash flow to support its rising dividend. ', ""Mid-America Apartment Communities, or MAA, pays a 4.7%-yielding dividend. The apartment-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) has been an excellent passive income producer over the years. It declared its 120th consecutive quarterly dividend in early 2024. While the REIT hasn't increased its dividend every year, it has never cut its payment and has steadily raised it over time, including by 5% earlier this year. "", ""That stable upward trend in its dividend should continue. The company's existing portfolio delivers consistent net operating income growth. The REIT focuses on owning properties in the high-growth Sun Belt region that benefit from high occupancy levels and steadily rising rental rates. It will spend money to renovate older units, which helps keep occupancy up and enables it to charge a higher rental rate. "", 'Meanwhile, MAA also invests in new apartment community developments. It currently has five projects under construction that it expects to complete over the next two years. It plans to begin four to six more projects over the next two years. On top of that, the REIT will opportunistically acquire developable land and operating communities. For example, it bought two recently developed communities during the fourth quarter of last year for $210 million. It also purchased a half-acre land parcel near one of its current development projects. Growing rental income from its existing portfolio and new additions should enable MAA to continue steadily increasing its attractive dividend. ', ""Chevron, Brookfield Renewable, and MAA pay high-yielding dividends that steadily rise. Because of that, they'll help me on my march toward financial independence. That's why I plan to buy a few more shares of each this month, which likely won't be the last time I add to these terrific income stocks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

However, given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future.

Demand for its COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and its treatment (Paxlovid) soared during the pandemic's height. With the coronavirus contagion abating in the meantime, though, last year's sales fell 41%. Income fell more than 70% year over year. Yikes."", ""However, the stock's sellers have arguably overshot their target. Pfizer stock is not only now well undervalued, but it's now sporting a big dividend yield of 6.2% as well."", ""That's a well-funded dividend, by the way, that's been raised every year for the past 15 years."", 'The rapid rise and equally rapid fall of Pfizer stock makes sense. Circumstances in 2020 and 2021 were unusual to the point of being scary. Then in 2022, interest in combating the COVID-19 pandemic waned faster than the pandemic itself did. Investors were forced into making buying and selling decisions faster than they normally might.', ""The dust is finally settling, though. We can start making calls based on a company's plausible long-term prospects. And Pfizer's long-term prospects look pretty compelling."", ""Sure, Paxlovid's and Comirnaty's enormous revenue is in the past. But look forward. This is the same pharmaceutical company behind blood thinner Eliquis, pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, cancer-fighting Ibrance and Xtandi, and arthritis drug Xeljanz, just to name a few. All of these are blockbuster drugs (annual sales of more than $1 billion), and they're only a sampling of Pfizer's entire portfolio. To this end, excluding COVID-19-driven revenue, Pfizer's 2023 top line was actually up 7%."", ""Comparable growth is in the cards too. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 2.5% this year, which is expected to accelerate to a growth pace of 4.6% next year. Earnings are apt to grow even more, from last year's $1.84 per share to $2.20 this year, and $2.74 per share in 2025."", ""It sounds like a lot ... and it is. But the drugmaker has been busy in recent years at the same time it's been addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, early last year Pfizer announced plans to launch 19 new drugs -- or at least new indications -- within the following 18 months that will generate $20 billion worth of annual revenue by 2030. It's on track to reach that goal too, with last year's debut of RSV vaccine Abrysvo, the recent expansion of Elrexfio's approval label to include multiple myeloma, and more."", ""Near the end of this year, look for Pfizer to begin a deeper integration of recently acquired Seagen, which bolsters the pharmaceutical giant's oncology portfolio. The company believes the addition of Seagen's drugs could add more than $10 billion per year to the top line by 2030."", ""Beyond that, know that Pfizer's current pipeline includes 112 different trials, 31 of which are in the third and final phase of their testing, and six of which are already being reviewed by regulators for potential approval."", ""So why isn't any of this being reflected in the price of Pfizer stock? Good question. But it would be naïve to ignore the dynamic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It put a white-hot bullish spotlight on the company. Investors weren't quite sure how to value the stock while the spotlight was dimming, and they were even less certain once that light finally faded. It's now been a few years since COVID-related products weren't the focal point of discussions about Pfizer's results."", ""That ensuing correction does appear to have finally run its full course, however, and then some. Shares are trading at less than 15 times their trailing earnings, and less than 10 times next year's projected per-share profits. Both measures are unusually low, even for a slow-growth behemoth like Pfizer. For perspective, the S&P 500's trailing and forward-looking price-to-earnings ratios are both above 20 at this time. The index's dividend yield is also a modest 1.4%, versus Pfizer's 6.2%."", ""Connect the dots -- there's a clear value-based argument to be made for owning a piece of the pharmaceutical company. The argument for owning Pfizer for the long haul -- maybe even forever -- is even stronger."", ""This is a company that's been around for 175 years. Its executives collectively have decades of experience in the drug business. And, Pfizer itself has the financial wherewithal to either develop or buy the new products it needs to replace its aging ones. Remember, this is the same company many investors feared would struggle to get past the expiration of its patent on cholesterol-fighting Lipitor in 2011, and then the loss of patent protection on Viagra in 2017. Yet, here we are talking about Eliquis, Elrexfio, and the potential of the Seagen acquisition."", ""A position in Pfizer is never going to be as rewarding as a stake in, say, Nvidia or Amazon. The pharmaceutical business just doesn't move that fast, particularly for bigger players like Pfizer."", ""What Pfizer lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in longevity. Right now, it more than makes up for its slower growth pace with an incredible dividend yield. Income-seeking investors won't want to miss this boat."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

The mRNA-focused vaccine maker rose to prominence following a successful attempt at developing a coronavirus vaccine.', ""However, the stock fell out of favor once sales of the company's only product on the market started moving in the wrong direction. Moderna's shares are down by 30% in the past year, but their total return over the past four years is 230%, and there remain good reasons to invest in the company."", ""Though the coronavirus vaccine market is no longer as lucrative as it once was, it isn't going away completely. COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. in 2023. Millions of people, particularly those who have underlying conditions that make them more at risk of hospitalization and death, will continue to get inoculated every year."", 'So Moderna should continue to generate sales from this market. Things are looking good on that front: The numbers show that Moderna is improving its position in the coronavirus vaccine space. The biotech had a 48% share of the U.S. market in the fall of 2023, compared to 37% in the comparable period of 2022.', ""Moderna has substantially closed the gap on its biggest rival, Pfizer. In 2022, Moderna had sales of $18.4 billion, compared to $37.8 billion for Pfizer. Last year, it was $6.7 billion to $11.2 billion in sales, still in favor of Pfizer. But that's a much smaller difference than in 2022."", ""Things are a bit more complicated for 2024. Moderna expects $4 billion in sales for the year, but that won't be solely from its COVID-19 franchise. At least $3 billion should be from coronavirus-related sales. And even if you take the lower end of that COVID franchise guidance, the company would still gain ground on Pfizer's estimated $5 billion in coronavirus vaccine revenue this year."", ""Even though the coronavirus vaccine market won't be as important for Moderna in future years, the company's success in gaining ground against its most notable competitor is great."", ""Moderna seems close to launching a non-coronavirus product. Last year, the company's investigational vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mRNA-1345, reported positive results in a phase 3 clinical trial. The biotech submitted applications to various regulatory authorities, including in the U.S., and expects a response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May."", 'The RSV market is still new; the first vaccines earned approval just last year. But RSV is especially dangerous for seniors and Moderna estimates this market could hit peak sales of $10 billion. It was worth just $2.5 billion in 2023.', 'As CEO Stéphane Bancel pointed out in an earnings call this month with analysts, ""This is quite impressive given it was the first year the RSV vaccines were available. They were not even available for a full year, and the products were not approved in many countries."" In other words, Moderna isn\'t too late to the party. The company\'s RSV vaccine could contribute meaningfully to its top line and help it decrease its reliance on its coronavirus franchise.', ""Beyond mRNA-1345, Moderna has several products in its late-stage pipeline that could hit the market within the next three years. It is running a phase 3 study for a vaccine for cytomegalovirus, an area where there are no approved options yet. Moderna is also developing a combination COVID-influenza vaccine that's in late-stage studies."", ""The biotech teamed up with another major player in the industry, Merck, to test its cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, in a phase 3 study. In a midstage study, mRNA-4157, in combination with Merck's famous cancer drug Keytruda, was able to decrease the risk of recurrence or death in melanoma patients."", ""There is significant potential in Moderna's late-stage pipeline and the biotech has many programs in phase 2 studies that should make substantial progress in the years ahead. In total, Moderna has more than two dozen candidates in the works. That's one more reason why, despite recent struggles, Moderna looks like an excellent biotech stock to buy and hold."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Moderna right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Moderna, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Moderna wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024. ', 'The stock market of 2024 is driven by the same trends that saw investors glued to their screens in 2023. The primary themes in the market right now are artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, with the final week of February providing investors with key data points and news on both fronts.', ""Before we get to the news, it's important to see how large cap stocks are fairing these days. These stocks are typically sizeable, mature, and established companies that command strong market positions along with comforting balance sheets. Like other stocks, their performance is also tied to the stock market, and large cap stocks typically attract investors during economic downturns or shaky conditions as they offer comfort with their ability to hedge against major losses."", 'Diving deeper into large cap stocks, these can be divided either along their industries or their fundamentals to further fine tune any performance expectations. Large cap stocks in stable sectors such as consumer defensive, the likes of the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) or the consumer goods behemoth Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are sizeable entities whose global brand following enables investors to rest in comfort knowing that even if the stock and revenue are down in a recession, both will pick up ones the economic winds become more favorable.', 'On the flip side, large cap stocks belonging to high risk sectors such as biotechnology are significantly vulnerable to market whims as well as any whiff that investors might get about potential troubles. For instance, consider the large cap biotechnology stocks Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). These two stocks are household names due to their coronavirus vaccine, but despite being multi billion dollar firms, the shares have painted quite an eye watering performance if we consider their performance over the course of the past couple of years.', ""In fact, the risky nature of these large cap stock industries means that investors have to be on constant watch out for any headwinds that could affect business performance. For Moderna, this came in the form of a report in February 2024 that its vaccine for a respiratory virus had demonstrated reduced efficacy. The shares tumbled 7% on that day, and overall, the stock is down 22% year to date, proving that just because a stock is a large cap does not mean that it will always remain stable. Similarly, BioNTech's stock is down by nearly 15% during its latest earnings report that saw the firm stress that it would return to growth in 2025 after it scales up oncology products to mitigate the effects of a bottoming out of its COVID vaccine market."", ""So, with some drivers of large cap stock performance out of the way, let's focus on the news before a brief primer on value stocks. The tail end of February 2024 has seen large cap artificial intelligence stock Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) beat analyst second quarter revenue and profit estimates as it shared that growth in its semiconductor design products and solutions for AI chips should help with a great second quarter. Focusing on the Fed, the central bank's January meeting minutes show that participants continued to be worried about cutting interest rates too soon. This is natural since recent producer inflation prints remain stubbornly high, and for large cap value stocks, this might be good news."", 'This is because, in tight economic conditions, growth stocks, such as those characterized by high price to earnings (P/E) ratios typically fall. On the flip side, value stocks tend to hold their ground as investors have set their market share price reasonably in comparison to fundamentals such as EPS.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top large cap value stocks to buy.

The company thrived during the pandemic and had lofty growth expectations over the next few years. However, the company has faced challenges since then, leading to revised expectations and a stock sell-off; the stock is down 80% from its peak price in 2021.', ""PayPal is under new leadership that is looking to right the ship, and the stock trades at a cheap valuation relative to its history. Here's what you should know to help you decide if PayPal is right for your portfolio."", 'PayPal experienced massive growth during the pandemic, adding 122 million new accounts and growing revenue by 43% over two years while surpassing $1 trillion in total payment volume.', 'The company was flying high and dreamed of considerable growth in the following years. At the time, the company expected to nearly double its active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million by 2025. It also expected free cash flow and revenue to double. At its peak, investors valued PayPal stock at 16.9 times sales and 109.3 times earnings.', 'As it turns out, those expectations were too optimistic, and the company shifted its focus from rapid growth to a more sustainable one. Customer growth slowed, and PayPal focused on getting more activity from its existing customers instead of adding new accounts hand over fist. This shift in focus alarmed investors. On top of that, eBay, which owned PayPal until spinning it off in 2015, shifted away from the company and moved over to Adyen as its preferred payment platform, creating headwinds for further growth.', ""Investor pessimism regarding PayPal has probably never been higher than it is today, which is evident when looking at the company's valuation. Today, investors are pricing PayPal stock at 2.2 times sales and 15.7 times earnings, both of which are the lowest valuations ever for the company since being spun off from eBay in 2015."", ""Investors have expressed concerns about PayPal's margins, which have gradually declined. Its gross margin, or the company's sales minus its cost of goods sold (transaction costs for PayPal), was around 65% back in 2015. Today, its gross margin is around 46%. One reason for its falling margins is the growing popularity of PayPal's unbranded checkout option, Braintree, over its branded checkout option."", ""Braintree is a rapidly growing part of PayPal's business, which is great for top-line growth but hasn't been so great for increasing its profits. In the fourth quarter, total payment volume (TPV) was up 15% year over year, and Braintree was vital to this growth. Growth has been especially strong internationally, with TPV up 22% (or 17% on a currency-neutral basis), thanks to strength in Europe and Asia."", 'During the fourth-quarter earnings call, new CEO Alex Chriss said that the company will focus on accelerating growth in branded checkout, which has higher margins. It will do this by redesigning the branded checkout experience to make it more efficient and minimize friction, allowing shoppers to check out twice as quickly.', ""Another move the company is making is improving its small and medium-sized business offerings with PayPal Complete Payments. The company will look to scale this offering by leveraging its data and artificial intelligence to improve conversion rates for its merchants while helping them better connect with customers. If PayPal can pull this off, it could boost profit margins and provide additional offerings for small and mid-sized businesses, which was Chriss' specialty at Intuit before becoming PayPal's CEO."", 'In an interview with CNBC last month, Chriss said, ""2024 will be a transition year for us."" PayPal stock will likely experience further volatility throughout the year as it works to improve its margins and scale up its small and medium-sized business offerings.', ""Despite its struggles, PayPal continues to generate strong revenue. Last year, the company grew its revenue by 8% and posted its best net income on record, with its $4.25 billion topping 2021's $4.2 billion.

For example, claims can be processed in seconds instead of days in many cases and getting (and accepting) insurance quotes is a seamless process.', 'In the fourth quarter, Lemonade reported surprisingly strong results. It surpassed the high end of its guidance range for revenue, in-force premium, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The latter showed that losses are narrowing rather quickly.', 'Management said it expects to be cash-flow positive during 2025 and that the business will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2026. With nearly $1 billion in cash and investments, the company has plenty of runway to get there.', ""Not only did all of these metrics look great, but the company's loss ratio came in at 77% -- a big improvement over the 89% figure from the fourth quarter of 2022 and just above its 75% long-term target. (To be fair, the fourth quarter is seasonally strong for insurance profitability.)"", ""Despite the generally stellar results from the business, Lemonade's stock went down by more than 20% after the report. Not only did management's revenue guidance come in a little weaker than investors were hoping for in 2024, but the company said it's returning to growth mode in 2024 and increased growth expenses could put pressure on profitability."", ""Even so, the company's numbers are all heading in the right direction.

With a market cap of only $65 billion, the repurchases would represent nearly 8% of the company's equity value."", 'This is a huge bet for PayPal. Now trading at a depressed valuation, buying back stock could prove a genius move. But if history is any indication, PayPal could end up rapidly destroying shareholder value.', ""The company has already spent $15 billion in share repurchases since going public in 2015. Most of those stock buybacks ended up destroying shareholder value given the repurchase prices were much higher than today's valuation."", 'Is this time different? Here are three reasons the company is optimistic.', 'PayPal may have spent billions of dollars on share repurchases in the past, but 100% of those buyback programs were executed at a higher valuation than today.', 'When the company went public in 2015, PayPal stock traded at roughly 5 times sales. During the pandemic bull market that pushed up the share prices of nearly every tech company, PayPal stock was valued as high as 15 times sales.', ""Today, PayPal stock trades at an all-time low valuation of just 2.2 times sales. There are plenty of reasons for this depressed valuation. From 2015 to 2020, PayPal's quarterly revenue growth averaged between 15% and 20%. In recent quarters, that growth rate has slowed to about 8%."", ""There are also concerns that the company could be underinvesting in its future. In 2020, the company spent roughly 12% of its revenue on research and development. Today, that figure is around 10%. It's not a huge dip, but when growth begins to slow, the last thing a company can afford to do is neglect research and development efforts that can help reverse the trend."", ""There are more positive reasons management believes now is the time to buy back $5 billion in stock. But there's no doubt that negative events and trends during the past year or two have created arguably the best conditions in company history to buy back shares."", 'Despite a slowdown in revenue growth, PayPal has continue to generate huge sums of reliable cash flow. The shares now trade at a free-cash-flow yield of 6.3%, the highest yield in company history thanks to more than $4 billion in free cash flow generated during the past 12 months.', 'Historically, the company has spent a good chunk of this money on share repurchases. More than $11 billion, meanwhile, has been directed toward acquisitions.', 'The recent slowdown in growth suggests that perhaps PayPal should have allocated more funds to research and development. Still, management has to figure out something to do with its excess cash. The company now sits on a record $9.1 billion in cash, a figure that will only continue to grow if management fails to spend inbound cash flow.', ""It's not the greatest rationale in the world, but a big reason PayPal continues to buy back stock is because there is cash burning a hole in its pocket. If acquisitions and a dividend aren't on the table, investing in itself becomes the only option."", 'Strategically, it seems as if PayPal executives prefer additional buybacks versus a boost in internal innovation.', ""PayPal is underinvesting in research and development compared to its past, but that doesn't mean it isn't capable of innovation."", ""Last fall, the company unveiled a suite of new services and features, all meant to reverse the declining growth trend. One innovation in particular shows not only the company's established market power, but also where it could find a new growth engine."", 'PayPal calls this innovation ""Fastlane."" The pitch is simple: PayPal has 400 million active users, meaning it can recognize a huge percentage of visitors to retail sites. With Fastlane, potential buyers can check out without entering any additional information. According to the company, this technology can reduce checkout times by up to 40%.', 'No one feature will return PayPal to its former growth rates, but features like Fastlane appear promising. Currently, the overall e-commerce market is growing faster than PayPal. If the company can find ways to more deeply integrate itself into the global e-commerce market, a rising tide could provide a much needed lift.', ""PayPal executives know the stock is historically cheap. They're also well aware of how much free cash flow the company is generating. By promising to buy back so much stock this year, they're almost certainly betting on new innovations like Fastlane to reverse its growth trajectory, a scenario that would likely result in a sizable valuation bump for PayPal shares."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Whether the AI market darlings deserve their rich valuations or not, three Fool.com contributors believe it's time to look beyond the usual suspects."", 'They put their heads together to uncover existing tech giants like International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Cloudflare (NYSE: NET), and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM)\xa0-- three great companies with deep AI expertise. This trio offers compelling value and potentially significant long-term returns from their AI initiatives.', ""Investing is a marathon. IBM, Salesforce, and Cloudflare have been running the AI race for years, and they won't stop anytime soon."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): Generative AI tools and flashy consumer tech often dominate the headlines. Meanwhile, good old tech titan IBM is quietly positioning itself as the backbone of enterprise-grade AI solutions.', ""The company's hybrid cloud focus, emphasis on explainability and trackable data sources, and deep industry relationships might not seem as sexy as the latest ChatGPT upgrade, but these are the very elements that should make IBM an enduring force in the AI space."", ""IBM's focus on long-term partnerships and sustainable solutions aligns with the needs of businesses wanting to use AI in an impactful yet responsible way. As concern grows around AI systems' potential for harmful biases, misleading output, and black-box decision-making, IBM's approach inspires a deeper trust."", 'The long-term contracts Big Blue signs with enterprise-class customers will depend on that professional-grade trust. ""Hallucinations"" and data mishaps are common themes in today\'s large language models (LLMs), but IBM isn\'t interested in playing that game. The likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet don\'t seem ready to compete from the transparency and quality angle so far.', 'Critics might argue that IBM\'s ""slow and steady"" approach is a disadvantage. But in the realm of enterprise solutions, patience and thoroughness should be seen as strengths. The slow and heavy vetting IBM\'s prospective clients apply to the Watson AI systems today will result in lucrative, hard-to-replace, multiyear contracts.', '""The early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said in the recent fourth-quarter earnings call.', ""Moreover, IBM's current valuation presents a potential value opportunity compared to some of the AI market's highfliers. The stock trades at a modest 2.7 times sales and 13 times free cash flow, making even Alphabet look expensive in comparison with the same ratios clocking in at 5.6 and 25, respectively."", ""If the company can continue to prove that its AI solutions add tangible, measurable value to businesses, investors who focus on long-term potential may find IBM to be the unsung workhorse of the AI revolution. If nothing else, you're looking at a generous dividend payer with torrential cash flows and a centennial business history."", 'IBM\'s big AI bet is starting to pay off right now, but even if the business-grade AI strategy fizzles, it\'s still a great income-generating stock to own in the long run. That\'s a big ""if,"" though. AI and hybrid cloud computing have emerged as leading growth drivers for the ultra-experienced tech giant. I expect good things and big wins from Big Blue\'s AI business in the coming years.', 'Billy Duberstein (Cloudflare): The past 18 months in artificial intelligence have been all about training, which is the act of building extremely large language models out of billions of data parameters. But now the AI industry is moving to an ""if you build it, they will come"" phase. In layman\'s terms, companies are now actually putting these models to work.', ""When a trained model is prompted and then goes to work on finding answers or completing a task, that's called inferencing. And inferencing applications are about to take off."", ""To see how that shift is unfolding, look no further than Nvidia's recent earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang said he estimates about 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue over the past year was actually for inference, not training. That's somewhat surprising, as Nvidia is thought to be the only game in town for training, whereas it's possible inferencing could be done with some lower-power processors from competitors."", 'One company that could be an under-the-radar inference play is Cloudflare, which began as a software company that helped speed up websites, software applications, and content delivery.', ""But Cloudflare's management was forward-thinking, taking the time and cost to build an integrated software stack from the beginning, whereby all of its new products and services can be run on the same type of commodity hardware. That has paid off in the form of an ever-increasing portfolio of products, including cybersecurity, network management, and developer platforms that run on its lightweight servers in internet service provider data centers close to customers at the edge."", 'Today, Cloudflare\'s servers are in 310 cities in over 120 countries connecting 13,000 networks, with its network now within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the world\'s population. And that makes Cloudflare a potentially ideal place for businesses to run their inference workloads. That\'s because inference workloads are likely too computing-intense to run on end devices such as PCs or phones, but are likely ""lightweight"" enough so that they don\'t have to be run all the way back in a large, cloud-based data center.', ""Management began to capitalize on this potential last September when Cloudflare released Workers AI, an inferencing-as-a-service platform for developers in Cloudflare's servers, which could potentially put Cloudflare up against the big cloud computing players for inference workloads."", ""And the new offering is showing early signs of success, with Workers AI requests growing 9x between September and December, according to Cloudflare's recent fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. And even though the new inference offering just came out and contributes little to revenues today, Cloudflare still saw a very healthy 32% revenue growth in the last quarter, driven by its core products. Of note, Cloudflare is really penetrating larger enterprise customers now, with the company recording its largest customer win, as well as its largest customer renewal ever last quarter."", ""With much-loved offerings across its core content delivery, network, and cybersecurity markets that are still growing strong, Cloudflare's new inference products could bolster its already-strong growth rate for years to come."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): After a couple of years of unwinding out-of-control spending that cropped up during the pandemic, customer data and relationship management platform Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is totally back. The software giant reported revenue growth of 11% this past year, despite a big slowdown in corporate spending as companies looked to tighten up as the economy slowed. Salesforce is predicting some of this soft spending among its users will continue, but is still nevertheless predicting revenue growth of about 9% for 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Salesforce).', 'As the business has matured, Salesforce made a quick pivot from all-out growth (it had been putting up 20%-plus sales growth for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock over the last two decades) to a more value-generating business. CEO Marc Benioff and the top team ratcheted up generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit margins this last year to 14.4%, and expects that figure to jump to 20.4% for full-year fiscal 2025.', ""Along the way, Salesforce started repurchasing its own stock as part of a new strategy to begin returning cash to shareholders. And starting this year, Salesforce will also begin paying a quarterly dividend -- which, as of this writing, is worth 0.5% in annualized yield. That's not too exciting, but it nevertheless signals this data management software company's successful evolution into a more mature business."", ""Of course, customer data is more important than ever in a new era of AI-fueled computing technology. Salesforce's own development of AI throughout its platform isn't translating into any pick-up in growth just yet. However, that tees up the possibility of management underpromising and overdelivering this year on financial guidance. Plus, Benioff and company said its own internal use of its AI tools should fuel the profit margin expansion story for years to come."", ""Salesforce stock now trades for about 45 times expected GAAP earnings per share (EPS), or about 30 times EPS on an adjusted basis (which corresponds a bit more closely to free cash flow). Shares have been on a hot run in the last year, but there are still years' worth of profitable returns left in the tank for this cloud software leader. I'm happy to keep holding."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

This reality makes companies that not only pay dividends but also increase them incredibly attractive for those of us who want to keep cash coming in even as our costs keep going up."", ""Dividends are never guaranteed payments, so finding companies that can reliably boost cash flows is often easier said than done. Still, they're worth searching for, so three Motley Fool contributors went looking for businesses that appear to have what it takes to hand their shareholders more cold, hard cash."", 'They picked Target (NYSE: TGT), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI). Read on to find out why and decide for yourself whether one or more of them may deserve a bit of your hard-earned cash.', ""Eric Volkman (Target): If you want a stock that's nearly assured to boost its payout before long (and who doesn't), it's wise to pick from the growing list of Dividend Kings. These are the rare S&P 500 component companies that have raised their payouts at least once a year for a minimum of 50 consecutive years."", 'Target is one of the newer Kings, with a streak of dividend raises ""only"" 52 years long.', ""It's also a stock making something of a comeback. Target was a retail industry rock star during the height of the pandemic, becoming an even more valuable go-to shopping destination for consumers stuck at home."", ""However, the company was careless after this, stocking up on inventory it couldn't sell effectively and failing to cope with the supply chain difficulties that were rife at that time."", ""The company has been recovering from this, but its profitability (and its share price) are still some distance from the lofty heights of the early 2020s. A certain degree of investor mistrust lingers, and for some, it's hard to forget those management miscues from a few years back."", 'Target has improved notably in recent times, though, and still has plenty of potential. Yes, sales were down by 4% year over year in its most recently reported quarter, but the retailer very much surprised on the upside with a monster 36% leap in headline net income.', 'Inflation seems to be moderating, so we might soon see the return of top-line growth; this should support continued profitability improvement.', ""With improving fundamentals, it's almost guaranteed that Target will maintain its dividend streak this year. This would be more than a welcome move, as the payout is already a comparatively high yielder at nearly 3%. That's more than double the average percentage on the S&P 500 index."", 'Jason Hall (Realty Income): Dividend investors have long appreciated Realty Income. It has a monthly payout and has increased it every single year since it went public in 1994.', ""That puts this real estate investment trust (REIT) on some pretty elite lists of dividend growth stocks. But management has long held itself and the company to an even higher standard of dividend growth. How about a payout increase every single quarter? That's right: The company's shareholders see a raise every three months!"", ""It's been happening for decades, too. In December, the company increased its dividend for the 105th straight quarter. That's a little more than 26 years of consecutive quarterly payout increases. That means investors in the company should see their next one in April."", 'How does the company do it? To start: by being conservative with the payout. It ended 2023 with an annualized dividend of $3.08 per share, while it earned $4 in adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share. FFO is a better measure of profits for REITs than net income. That works out to a payout ratio of 76% of FFO, a pretty sizable cushion for a REIT to maintain.', 'Second, and just as important, management has focused its business and capital allocation on some of the most resilient, disruption-resistant industries: 89% of its rents are built to thrive across a variety of economic conditions, and are not threatened by e-commerce. And the company has been very smart about the properties it acquires, using debt responsibly and not overpaying.', ""At recent prices, it's an attractive investment. The yield is close to 6%, and that dividend growth streak is likely to remain intact for many more years to come."", 'Chuck Saletta (Kinder Morgan): On its investor relations page, energy pipeline company Kinder Morgan indicates that it expects to pay about $1.15 per share in dividends for 2024. On a quarterly basis, that works out to $0.2875.', ""Looking over its dividend history, the company has paid $0.2825 over each of the past four quarters. That's $0.005 higher than the $0.2775 that it had paid out over the four quarters before those."", 'So Kinder Morgan has more or less telegraphed that it expects to announce another modest $0.005 quarterly increase in its dividend later this year.', ""Of course, no dividend payment is truly guaranteed until it actually gets paid, but investors have good reasons to believe that Kinder Morgan will follow through on that increase. In particular, in its February investor presentation, it indicated that it expects its distributable cash flow to increase by 8% to $2.26 per share in 2024. That same presentation also called for the company's seventh consecutive annual dividend increase in 2024."", 'Its distributable cash flow is money that Kinder Morgan can use to pay its dividends, pay down its debts, buy back its shares, or invest in its future. If that measure grows as expected, then it will easily generate enough money to cover that modest projected boost in its payout -- while also retaining cash flow for those other key financial purposes.', 'While an even higher payment would be nice, Kinder Morgan was forced to cut its dividend in late 2015 after overextending its balance sheet. Ever since then, the company has focused on assuring more sustainable cash flows to its shareholders.', ""Ultimately, a slowly growing dividend that's well supported by healthy operations and a reasonable balance sheet beats a bigger one that's at greater risk of being cut. As a result, investors should appreciate the fact that having been once bitten, the company is now certainly twice shy about making the same missteps that caused its problems nearly a decade ago."", ""Target, Realty Income, and Kinder Morgan each offer their investors a reason to believe that they could get paid a bit more for taking on the risks of owning their companies' shares. If those prospects seem good enough to you to warrant an investment, then now is a great time to consider buying them. After all, you need to own a company's shares before they go ex-dividend in order to have a chance of receiving its dividend payment."", ""So make today the day you look for ways to get your investments to adequately repay you.

This niche is Target's most important, and even a small rebound here could put the chain on the cusp of a revenue resurgence."", ""Comparable-store sales fell 5% in the third quarter (ended Oct. 28, 2023), and management predicted that Q4 results would land in a wide range around that same rate. Most Wall Street pros are looking for reported revenue to rise slightly this quarter, perhaps ending the chain's long sales slide."", ""The news is more clearly positive when it comes to Target's finances. Cash flow soared in 2023 as the company focused on efficiency and cut inventory in slow-moving merchandise categories. Prices rose in other areas, too, leading to a 27% gross profit margin through the first three quarters of 2023 (compared to 24% a year earlier). Target's operating profit improved to 5.1% of sales from 3.5% of sales, putting it closer to its pre-pandemic level of 6%."", ""It's great news that this rebound is happening even amid weak demand in the consumer discretionary niche. Resurgent growth there, then, could allow Target to easily boost margins while providing more resources that management can use to raise the dividend."", ""The big operating metric to watch in 2024 will be customer traffic, because Target absolutely needs to return to growth in this area. Yet its lower inventory and strong profitability and cash flow all point to a potentially large dividend increase when the chain makes its annual payout announcement (typically in June). Last year's hike was a modest 2% as management decided to pivot toward saving more cash."", ""The good news is Target has raised its dividend in each of the last 52 consecutive years, and its current yield of 2.9% is far above Walmart's 1.3% and Costco's 0.6%. Most investors will still want to watch this stock for now until there are concrete signs that Target has put its customer traffic slump behind it heading into fiscal 2024.

Their stocks have been huge winners in the past, both significantly outpacing the S&P 500 in the last 10 years.', ""The companies might be on your investing radar, so it's important to understand how these two credit card giants make money. Here's a closer look at the businesses of Visa and Mastercard."", ""Besides the customer and merchant, there are typically three other key parties involved in a card transaction. These are the customer's financial institution (issuing bank), the merchant's financial institution (merchant acquirer), and the payment network. All collect revenue in some form."", ""Anytime a card gets swiped, the merchant bears a cost, the biggest portion of which is known as an interchange. Some might think that this interchange fee, usually ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% depending on the card used and other factors, all goes to Visa and Mastercard. That's not true."", ""The interchange fee goes to the issuing bank. It's understandable why the customer's bank would get the largest chunk of a transaction's cost. The issuer has to find borrowers, underwrite them for credit cards, and handle payments. They take on the credit risk. Plus, they use the interchange fees to essentially fund credit card perks and rewards."", 'Anyone who follows the industry knows how much blame gets put on the so-called interchange fees. However, we can see that they serve a valid purpose. Visa and Mastercard have the power to set default interchange rates, but merchant and consumer banks can negotiate their own terms if they choose to.', ""On the other hand, Visa and Mastercard, which operate the underlying payment networks that connect all the different stakeholders, collect what's called an assessment fee, roughly 0.15% of a card transaction. This is a tiny part of what a merchant pays."", 'Given that in the last three months of 2023, Visa handled $3.9 trillion of volume and Mastercard handled $2.4 trillion of volume, the assessment fees can add up to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.', 'Because these companies are simply moving data around when processing transactions, their business models have scaled up extremely well. Both Visa (69% last quarter) and Mastercard (56% last quarter) report stellar operating margins.', ""Besides being incredibly profitable, these companies run two-sided payments platforms that benefit from powerful global network effects. What's more, the long-term secular transition of cash to cashless commerce supports many more years of strong growth for Visa and Mastercard."", ""But that doesn't mean investors don't have anything to worry about. When it comes to dominant enterprises, regulation is always a concern. In this instance, lawmakers are always trying to find ways to lower the fees that merchants pay to process card payments. The thinking is that those savings would result in lower prices for consumers."", 'This is what the Durbin Amendment, enacted in 2011, tried to do when it came at debit card fees. However, studies have shown that there are minimal signs of consumer savings, as merchants likely reap the savings for themselves.', ""And feeling the need to make up for the lower interchange revenue, it's rare to see banks offer rewards or perks on debit cards. Additionally, free checking accounts are hard to find these days."", 'Visa and Mastercard have successfully navigated regulatory challenges in the past. All stakeholders understand the value these businesses provide for the smooth functioning of the economy. This protects their competitive standing.', ""As of this writing, shares of Visa and Mastercard trade at price-to-earnings ratios of 29 and 33, respectively. These aren't cheap on an absolute basis, but some investors might still find the stocks worth buying, given the high quality of these businesses."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

The S&P 500 has surged roughly 28% over the past year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has rocketed over 40%. That has those market indexes trading at higher valuations. ', 'The S&P 500 currently trades at a 23 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while the Nasdaq 100 fetches over 30 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, many stocks trade at even frothier valuations. ', 'However, some good values remain, even in the current bull market. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) are dirt cheap these days. That makes them great value stocks to buy this March.', ""Kinder Morgan produces gobs of stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. The natural gas pipeline giant expects to generate about $5.1 billion, or $2.26 per share, of distributable cash flow this year. That's about 8% more than last year. "", ""With shares recently trading around $17 apiece, Kinder Morgan sells for around 7.5 times its cash flow. That's an extremely cheap price for a company that produces stable and growing cash flow."", 'Kinder Morgan uses about half its steady cash to pay dividends. Its payout currently yields 6.6%, which is one of the highest yields in the S&P 500 due to its bottom-of-the-barrel valuation. It uses the rest to invest in its continued growth, buy back its dirt cheap stock, and strengthen its already solid investment-grade balance sheet. ', ""The company's growing cash flow will give it more fuel to increase the dividend (2024 will be its seventh straight year of dividend growth) and enhance shareholder value through new growth-related investments. "", ""Brookfield Infrastructure also generates lots of steady cash flow backed by similar frameworks. The global infrastructure giant generated $2.95 per share of funds from operations (FFO) last year. That was up 9% from 2022's level. "", ""With the stock recently below $34, Brookfield Infrastructure trades at about 11.5 times its cash flow. Meanwhile, it's even cheaper at its current cash flow run rate. Brookfield closed a couple of needle-moving investments late last year, raising its annualized FFO run rate to $3.16 per share, a 17% year-over-year increase. That lowers its valuation to 10.7 times FFO. "", ""Brookfield expects to continue growing briskly. It sees a trio of organic growth drivers (inflation-driven rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects) powering 6% to 9% annual FFO per share growth. Meanwhile, acquisitions could drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports Brookfield's plan to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.8%) by 5% to 9% annually. "", ""Telecom giant Verizon produces very stable earnings and cash flow. The company expects its adjusted earnings to be in the range of $4.50-$4.70 per share this year. With the stock recently trading at around $40 a share, it sells for about 8.7 times forward earnings at the midpoint. That's incredibly cheap for such a stable company, and a big reason why its dividend yields 6.7%. "", ""Verizon currently uses its stable cash flow ($37.5 billion in 2023) to invest in expanding its network ($18.8 billion in capital expenses), pay dividends ($11 billion in 2023), and strengthen its already strong balance sheet. The company's cash flow should grow in the coming years as its revenue rises and costs decline (Verizon aims to cut costs by $2 billion-$3 billion by next year, while capital spending will fall to a range of $17 billion-$17.5 billion in 2024). That will give it more cash to pay dividends (it has increased its payment for 17 straight years) and continue strengthening its balance sheet. "", 'The company is currently working to transform its balance sheet from strong (with an A-/BBB+/Baa1 bond rating and 2.6 times leverage ratio) to elite (its long-term target is to get leverage down to 1.75-2.0 times). As leverage falls to a lower level (around 2.25 times), Verizon plans to start returning more cash to investors by repurchasing some of its dirt cheap stock. ', 'While the market currently trades at lofty valuations, some compelling values are still out there. Kinder Morgan, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Verizon stand out for their dirt cheap valuations. That makes them great value buys this March.

Their ability to handle many processing tasks simultaneously made them the crucial ingredient for all of the visual elements involved in powering games -- and a few years down the road, this same ability made GPUs critical for powering AI too.', ""Today, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and the company's reputation, full suite of products and services, and rising investment in research and development mean it's likely to stay ahead. Nvidia's earnings over the past year show an impressive pace of growth, with annual revenue and net income rising by triple-digit percentages. Revenue has set records quarter after quarter, led by the company's data center unit, which includes its AI offerings."", ""It's also important to note Nvidia's products are in use by all of the major cloud platforms, meaning the company is able to reach customers through services they know and trust -- and these cloud platforms work to sell Nvidia products to these customers."", ""Even considering Nvidia's enormous gains over the past year and a half, the company only trades for 31 times forward earnings estimates, a reasonable price considering Nvidia's dominance in the market and the growth prospects ahead."", 'Businesses of all kinds own loads of data that, if collected and managed properly, could be extremely valuable for their operations.

In the company\'s most recent letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp referred to AIP as the future of Palantir, and said it has already driven gains in revenue and customers. Palantir\'s manner of introducing AIP to potential customers is particularly clever -- the company hosts ""bootcamps"" to highlight its services and show individual companies how AIP could be a game-changer for them.', ""Palantir once was known largely for serving governments, but these days, it has put its focus on growing its commercial business, and those efforts are bearing fruit. In the fourth quarter, Palantir's commercial revenue growth outpaced government revenue growth -- with a 32% gain versus an 11% gain. And U.S. commercial revenue, in particular, took off, climbing 70% year over year."", ""Now let's talk valuation. Palantir's might seem lofty at 74 times forward earnings estimates, but I'd be willing to pay a premium for this stock, knowing the company is in the process of making an important shift toward increasing its commercial business and growing its newly launched AIP service."", ""Here, it's key to imagine potential a few years down the road.

This trio offers compelling value and potentially significant long-term returns from their AI initiatives.', ""Investing is a marathon. IBM, Salesforce, and Cloudflare have been running the AI race for years, and they won't stop anytime soon."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): Generative AI tools and flashy consumer tech often dominate the headlines. Meanwhile, good old tech titan IBM is quietly positioning itself as the backbone of enterprise-grade AI solutions.', ""The company's hybrid cloud focus, emphasis on explainability and trackable data sources, and deep industry relationships might not seem as sexy as the latest ChatGPT upgrade, but these are the very elements that should make IBM an enduring force in the AI space."", ""IBM's focus on long-term partnerships and sustainable solutions aligns with the needs of businesses wanting to use AI in an impactful yet responsible way. As concern grows around AI systems' potential for harmful biases, misleading output, and black-box decision-making, IBM's approach inspires a deeper trust."", 'The long-term contracts Big Blue signs with enterprise-class customers will depend on that professional-grade trust. ""Hallucinations"" and data mishaps are common themes in today\'s large language models (LLMs), but IBM isn\'t interested in playing that game. The likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet don\'t seem ready to compete from the transparency and quality angle so far.', 'Critics might argue that IBM\'s ""slow and steady"" approach is a disadvantage. But in the realm of enterprise solutions, patience and thoroughness should be seen as strengths. The slow and heavy vetting IBM\'s prospective clients apply to the Watson AI systems today will result in lucrative, hard-to-replace, multiyear contracts.', '""The early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said in the recent fourth-quarter earnings call.', ""Moreover, IBM's current valuation presents a potential value opportunity compared to some of the AI market's highfliers. The stock trades at a modest 2.7 times sales and 13 times free cash flow, making even Alphabet look expensive in comparison with the same ratios clocking in at 5.6 and 25, respectively."", ""If the company can continue to prove that its AI solutions add tangible, measurable value to businesses, investors who focus on long-term potential may find IBM to be the unsung workhorse of the AI revolution. If nothing else, you're looking at a generous dividend payer with torrential cash flows and a centennial business history."", 'IBM\'s big AI bet is starting to pay off right now, but even if the business-grade AI strategy fizzles, it\'s still a great income-generating stock to own in the long run. That\'s a big ""if,"" though. AI and hybrid cloud computing have emerged as leading growth drivers for the ultra-experienced tech giant. I expect good things and big wins from Big Blue\'s AI business in the coming years.', 'Billy Duberstein (Cloudflare): The past 18 months in artificial intelligence have been all about training, which is the act of building extremely large language models out of billions of data parameters. But now the AI industry is moving to an ""if you build it, they will come"" phase. In layman\'s terms, companies are now actually putting these models to work.', ""When a trained model is prompted and then goes to work on finding answers or completing a task, that's called inferencing. And inferencing applications are about to take off."", ""To see how that shift is unfolding, look no further than Nvidia's recent earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang said he estimates about 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue over the past year was actually for inference, not training. That's somewhat surprising, as Nvidia is thought to be the only game in town for training, whereas it's possible inferencing could be done with some lower-power processors from competitors."", 'One company that could be an under-the-radar inference play is Cloudflare, which began as a software company that helped speed up websites, software applications, and content delivery.', ""But Cloudflare's management was forward-thinking, taking the time and cost to build an integrated software stack from the beginning, whereby all of its new products and services can be run on the same type of commodity hardware. That has paid off in the form of an ever-increasing portfolio of products, including cybersecurity, network management, and developer platforms that run on its lightweight servers in internet service provider data centers close to customers at the edge."", 'Today, Cloudflare\'s servers are in 310 cities in over 120 countries connecting 13,000 networks, with its network now within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the world\'s population. And that makes Cloudflare a potentially ideal place for businesses to run their inference workloads. That\'s because inference workloads are likely too computing-intense to run on end devices such as PCs or phones, but are likely ""lightweight"" enough so that they don\'t have to be run all the way back in a large, cloud-based data center.', ""Management began to capitalize on this potential last September when Cloudflare released Workers AI, an inferencing-as-a-service platform for developers in Cloudflare's servers, which could potentially put Cloudflare up against the big cloud computing players for inference workloads."", ""And the new offering is showing early signs of success, with Workers AI requests growing 9x between September and December, according to Cloudflare's recent fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. And even though the new inference offering just came out and contributes little to revenues today, Cloudflare still saw a very healthy 32% revenue growth in the last quarter, driven by its core products. Of note, Cloudflare is really penetrating larger enterprise customers now, with the company recording its largest customer win, as well as its largest customer renewal ever last quarter."", ""With much-loved offerings across its core content delivery, network, and cybersecurity markets that are still growing strong, Cloudflare's new inference products could bolster its already-strong growth rate for years to come."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): After a couple of years of unwinding out-of-control spending that cropped up during the pandemic, customer data and relationship management platform Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is totally back. The software giant reported revenue growth of 11% this past year, despite a big slowdown in corporate spending as companies looked to tighten up as the economy slowed. Salesforce is predicting some of this soft spending among its users will continue, but is still nevertheless predicting revenue growth of about 9% for 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Salesforce).', 'As the business has matured, Salesforce made a quick pivot from all-out growth (it had been putting up 20%-plus sales growth for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock over the last two decades) to a more value-generating business. CEO Marc Benioff and the top team ratcheted up generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit margins this last year to 14.4%, and expects that figure to jump to 20.4% for full-year fiscal 2025.', ""Along the way, Salesforce started repurchasing its own stock as part of a new strategy to begin returning cash to shareholders. And starting this year, Salesforce will also begin paying a quarterly dividend -- which, as of this writing, is worth 0.5% in annualized yield. That's not too exciting, but it nevertheless signals this data management software company's successful evolution into a more mature business."", ""Of course, customer data is more important than ever in a new era of AI-fueled computing technology. Salesforce's own development of AI throughout its platform isn't translating into any pick-up in growth just yet. However, that tees up the possibility of management underpromising and overdelivering this year on financial guidance. Plus, Benioff and company said its own internal use of its AI tools should fuel the profit margin expansion story for years to come."", ""Salesforce stock now trades for about 45 times expected GAAP earnings per share (EPS), or about 30 times EPS on an adjusted basis (which corresponds a bit more closely to free cash flow). Shares have been on a hot run in the last year, but there are still years' worth of profitable returns left in the tank for this cloud software leader. I'm happy to keep holding."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has given investors its best Nvidia impression. The stock is up a whopping 750% over the past year.', ""Now, a stock rarely goes up that much, that quickly. That's why it might seem wild that I'm predicting it will continue. Of course, success may not be a straight line. Still, I believe Supermicro, as it is better known these days, could easily mimic Nvidia's epic multiyear run and soar upward over the coming years."", ""The recipe for Supermicro's success is simple. Dominant leadership in a rapidly growing industry equals outperformance. Investors are already seeing the equation play out, which helps explain the stock's remarkable success. My prediction is based on the simple theory that artificial intelligence (AI) spending will continue well into the future."", 'First, the basics. Supermicro is a computing hardware innovator. It began with motherboards in the early 1990s but today sells turn-key modular server systems to corporations. Do you know how to build a computer from scratch? Neither do many companies. So, like most would do, they turn to an expert like Supermicro.', ""Supermicro's modular system can be easily scaled to the size a company needs and can be built upon in the future if needs grow. Like Nvidia's AI chips, customers are flocking to Supermicro for their AI needs:"", ""Management is basing this on its internal data and industry data from Gartner. Supermicro's revenue grew 103% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and guidance is for up to 218% year-over-year growth in the current quarter."", 'The million-dollar question, of course, is whether this can last. According to the people most connected to AI, it can and will. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made headlines for his call to expand global chip capacity, claiming a need to invest trillions of dollars for the cause. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted an additional $1 trillion in data center spending over the next several years.', ""If these predictions are remotely accurate, Supermicro, which just did $3.7 billion in revenue in Q2, is poised to have more opportunities than it can shake a stick at. Ultimately, this has to play out, and an inability to support demand could send business to Supermicro's competitors. However, it's hard to see how Super Micro Computer doesn't have every opportunity to fulfill these skyrocketing expectations for long-term growth."", ""Given the abovementioned situation, it's reasonable to expect growth estimates to rise. That's happened already. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 48% annually over the long term. This seems realistic for a company now growing at a triple-digit rate."", ""At a forward P/E ratio of just 40, Supermicro's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, signaling that the stock is still a bargain for its expected future growth potential."", ""There's a fascinating psychological phenomenon called anchoring bias, in which the mind sticks to the first number it sees. In other words, investors see how much Supermicro has climbed over the past year and assume that the stock must be expensive. To be fair, most stocks are overpriced if they rise that much in a year."", 'However, data shows that Supermicro could be the exception. Now, there are investment risks because you are projecting things in the future. Nothing is guaranteed in life. However, the data and recent financial performance indicate a bright future for Super Micro Computer and its shareholders.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

60,43289516-ba1e-30bb-8f0a-c9a38c62e639,NVDA,2024-03-03,Is It Too Late to Buy Arm Holdings Stock?,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/43289516-ba1e-30bb-8f0a-c9a38c62e639/is-it-too-late-to-buy-arm.html,1709467500,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT']","[""It was only six months ago that investors were talking about the reintroduction of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) to the public markets. Now, just months later, market watchers are debating whether it's too late to buy the stock. Indeed, Arm Holdings has delivered 176% returns (as of market close on Thursday) since its late September initial public offering (IPO), more than 13 times the returns of the S&P 500."", ""Make no mistake -- it's the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that has sparked those gains. Arm's central processing units (CPUs) are found in a wide variety of electronic devices, including personal computers, tablets, smartphones, thermostats, drones, and smart TVs. However, its CPUs are also the gold standard, helping to run hyperscale computers, data centers, and cloud infrastructure services. It's this last group that represents the most compelling opportunity."", ""What does all this mean for investors who sat out Arm's recent run? Should they buy the stock now in the hope of additional upside or simply look elsewhere due to the company's frothy valuation? Let's dig in to see what the evidence reveals."", ""While Arm conducted its (most recent) IPO just five months ago, the company has a long and distinguished history in the tech world. The British semiconductor company was founded in 1990. Just a few years later, management revised Arm's business model. Rather than make processors, the company focused on licensing the intellectual property (IP) it developed."", ""That move was prescient. By offering licenses to all comers, Arm reached the scale necessary to make its licenses more cost-effective for customers than their own in-house development. Arm's chip designs quickly became the go-to processors powering mobile phones, eventually capturing an eye-catching 99% of the market."", 'The company went public on both the London and Nasdaq stock exchanges in 1998 before being taken private by SoftBank in late 2016. By then, the company was a household name in tech circles. Fast forward to late 2020, and chipmaker Nvidia made an offer to buy Arm for $40 billion before the deal was quashed by regulators. Late last year, SoftBank decided to spin off Arm while retaining a roughly 91% stake in the company.', 'And the rest, as they say, is history.', ""Lest there be any doubt, it's the rapid adoption of generative AI that represents Arm's biggest opportunity. While graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia do much of the heavy lifting, they're not alone. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines the capabilities of CPUs and GPUs working in unison, contains 144 of Arm's latest version 9 (V9) CPU cores. Nvidia isn't the only one: Microsoft designed a new AI server chip that incorporates more than 100 Arm cores."", ""The use of AI is spreading like wildfire as companies scramble to leverage the productivity gains these advanced algorithms offer. The strong demand helped boost Arm's recent financial results. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter, Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, while record royalty revenue climbed 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 32% to $0.29."", ""Yet that only tells part of the story. Arm's remaining performance obligation -- a forward-looking sales indicator -- grew 38% year over year, suggesting Arm's growth spurt will accelerate. As the adoption of AI grows, so too will Arm's fortunes."", 'Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann argues that the ""shift to accelerated computing ... for generative AI models"" will spark an upgrade cycle in the data center space. With an installed base of roughly $1 trillion, that\'s a lot of CPU cores, with Arm a primary beneficiary.', ""There's no clear consensus about the economic impact of AI, but everyone agrees the potential is massive. A report by Goldman Sachs suggests AI will boost labor productivity, driving a 7% or $7 trillion increase in global GDP. Morgan Stanley came in a close second at $6 trillion."", ""Whatever the total market ends up being, Arm's IP will be at the heart of this shift in the technological landscape, making the company a major player in the space."", ""There's no question that Arm's price tag is steep -- that is, when using the most popular valuation metrics. For example, the stock is selling for 1,874 times earnings (not a typo) and 50 times sales. Unfortunately, those metrics don't take into account Arm's current growth spurt. However, when measured using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which factors in its growth trajectory -- it sells for less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock."", ""Given the magnitude of the opportunity and its place in the industry, it's not too late to buy Arm stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), on the other hand, is an under-the-radar cloud services provider emerging as an on-ramp to the AI revolution for small and mid-size businesses."", ""Here's why investors might do well to buy both stocks right now."", 'Cyberthreats are a growing concern in the corporate world. Data breaches not only have severe financial consequences, but they also shatter the trust between companies and their customers. Attacks are increasing in sophistication with each passing year, and malicious actors are even using tools like generative AI to trick employees into handing over sensitive information through realistic phishing emails and phone calls.', ""Automation has never been more important to cybersecurity, because it's impossible to train every employee within an organization to be an expert. Palo Alto Networks says 93% of security operations centers still rely on manual, human-led processes, and the workload is so heavy that 23% of security incidents are left uninvestigated. That creates enormous vulnerabilities."", ""Palo Alto offers three cybersecurity platforms addressing cloud security, network security, and security operations. It's weaving AI into all of them, including its new Cortex XSIAM security operations product. For one customer, it resolves up to 90% of security incidents autonomously, with no human input required. XSIAM was released a little over one year ago, and it has already amassed a sales pipeline worth $1 billion."", ""Palo Alto is the world's largest cybersecurity company, and it plans to use that scale to crush its competitors. Many large organizations use cybersecurity tools from multiple providers based on their needs, but Palo Alto wants its customers to ditch competing products in favor of using its products exclusively."", ""To achieve this, Palo Alto will offer customers lengthy fee-free periods so they can integrate its software at no cost, which should encourage them to make the switch once their contracts are up with competing providers. A customer who uses all three of Palo Alto's platforms gets a lifetime value 40 times greater than a customer using just one, so this could drive significant long-term growth."", ""On the other hand, this strategy will lead to a short-term dip in Palo Alto's revenue and billings growth, which is why its stock suffered a sharp fall recently and now trades 16% below its all-time high. Nevertheless, the company still forecasts record revenue of up to $8 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending July 31)."", 'Therefore, the dip in its stock price might be a great entry point for long-term investors. Once Palo Alto begins reaping the rewards of its strategy, it could unlock a new phase of growth.', ""The world's largest cloud platforms, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, are spending billions of dollars to build data centers for AI development, mainly using chips from Nvidia. While they are focused on serving large organizations and cashed-up AI developers, DigitalOcean is making sure small and medium-sized businesses aren't left behind."", ""DigitalOcean is a provider of cloud services that help these businesses store data, host websites, and develop software. It offers cheap and transparent pricing, highly personalized service, and mountains of educational material to help customers maximize their output. It's an ideal platform for start-ups and businesses with less than 500 employees that can't afford in-house technical teams to manage their cloud infrastructure."", 'Last year, DigitalOcean spent $111 million to acquire Paperspace, a data center operator focused on delivering AI infrastructure at affordable prices. It offers the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) -- including the industry-leading H100 from Nvidia -- up to 70% cheaper than Microsoft Azure. Paperspace charges customers by the second with no lock-in contracts, and its narrow business model allows it to maintain a slim cost structure compared to the cloud giants. Those features lead to lower prices for the end user.', 'DigitalOcean estimates its opportunity in the small and medium-sized business cloud services industry will be worth $114 billion in 2024, which could swell to $213 billion by 2027. However, AI could dramatically expand that addressable market into the trillions of dollars, considering Wall Street predicts the technology could add somewhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.', 'DigitalOcean could soon become the go-to platform for these businesses who want to access AI. At the end of 2023, the company had only $730 million in annual recurring revenue, so it has barely scratched the surface of its addressable market, let alone the AI opportunity.', 'DigitalOcean stock remains 71% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021.

Perhaps -- eventually -- all the way to $1 trillion."", 'Will Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): When it comes to the AI chip market, Nvidia is dominant, claiming at least 80% of the market, according to analyst estimates. The insatiable demand for this type of semiconductor has taken Nvidia to an approximately $2 trillion market cap. It has also led customers to look elsewhere for such chips, and the company best positioned for second place is likely to be Advanced Micro Devices.', 'As a leader in CPUs, GPUs, and data centers, the company is well suited for this role, and it recently leveraged this expertise by releasing its AMD Instinct MI300 Series Accelerators to meet this demand. The MI300A combines the CPU and GPU in one unit, while its MI300X chip is the most advanced generative AI accelerator, according to the company.', 'Moreover, Allied Market Research forecasts the AI chip market will reach $384 billion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate of 38%! Thus, AI chipmakers should benefit across the board.', ""Currently, the data center and AI segment makes up around $6.5 billion of AMD's revenue, about 29%. Additionally, AMD is prominent in the client, gaming, and embedded segments, and combined, they made up over $16 billion of AMD's nearly $23 billion in revenue in 2023. Hence, these segments will contribute to the company's growth, though probably at a slower pace than AI."", 'As conditions stand now, it has reached a market cap of around $300 billion, meaning the stock has to rise by about 3.3 times to reach a $1 trillion market cap. This looks like an attainable goal. Analysts project 36% higher profits in 2024, with an additional 51% increase next year. Also, its forward P/E ratio is about 48.', ""Such a valuation is high, but it's far from bubble levels, indicating AMD could achieve a $1 trillion market cap organically. If AMD can meet part of this massive demand for AI chips, the semiconductor stock's market cap could reach the $1 trillion level sooner rather than later."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them.

In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), its yield is low because its stock price has outpaced its dividend raises."", 'Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) and MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM) both yield over 3% and have rich histories of raising their dividends over time. But both stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years.', ""Here's why we should see record-high payouts from all three companies this year and why each business has what it takes to continue rewarding shareholders in the future."", ""Daniel Foelber (Apple): Last May, Apple raised its dividend for the 11th consecutive year to $0.24 per share per quarter. I'd expect Apple to announce another raise when it reports its Q2 fiscal results this May. The question is how large the dividend raise will be."", 'Apple has issued minimum raises for a few years now of one cent per share per quarter. These raises keep the streak alive, but they do little to attract income investors, especially with the stock yielding just 0.5%.', 'As investors familiar with Apple may know, it could easily pay a much larger dividend. It just prefers to prioritize buybacks over dividends in its capital return program.', ""Last quarter, Apple spent $3.83 billion on dividends and $20.14 billion on buybacks. If it returned all of that capital to shareholders through the dividend and did no buybacks, Apple would yield 3%, which is double the S&P 500's 1.5% yield and far higher than any of its big tech peers."", ""Buybacks have been a far better use of capital than dividends. Apple stock is up over 825% over the past decade, and it has reduced its outstanding share count by 36%. The buyback program has been nothing short of brilliant. But there's a good argument that Apple should shift its capital spending program toward the dividend, mainly because the business is slower-growing and more mature than in past years."", 'Apple is posting record results in its service segment and iPhone demand from North America and many emerging markets. But its sales are falling in China, enough to make the whole business look bad right now.', ""Apple is a quality company that's going through a difficult downturn. It has also been largely left out of the artificial intelligence craze and has drastically underperformed Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia over the past six months."", ""Apple's ace in the hole is that it generates far more money than it needs to operate the business. That capital can be used to transform Apple into a surefire high-yield dividend stock, or spur growth, or something in between. Wall Street may be unwilling to take a bite out of Apple stock today, but underestimating the company's prospects could be a big mistake."", 'Scott Levine (Air Products): Air Products is poised to achieve a record payout to shareholders in 2024. But then the industrial gas producer and supplier has consistently hit the same mark for decades. For 42 consecutive years, Air Products has raised its dividend, making it a leading option for income investors seeking a high-quality dividend opportunity.', ""But wait: There's more."", 'Shares of Air Products, currently offering a forward yield of 3%, are sitting in the bargain bin, making it a compelling option for income and value investors alike.', ""Operating more than 750 production facilities and about 1,800 miles of gas pipeline, Air Products provides materials critical to various industries, including healthcare, energy, and aerospace. This business model helps to mitigate risk, since a downturn in any one industry is highly unlikely to catastrophically impair the company's financial well-being."", ""Moreover, its robust portfolio of assets contributes to the company's significant competitive advantage, making it highly unlikely that upstart companies will succeed in challenging Air Products' business."", ""Logging its 42nd year of consecutive increases, Air Products raised its quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share in January. If the company maintains this payout in the remaining quarters of 2024, it will mean the company has raised its payout at a 9% compound annual growth rate since 2014, a clear indication of the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders. And the company hasn't imperiled its financial well-being in achieving the feat. Over the past decade, Air Products has averaged a 62.3 % payout ratio."", 'With shares of Air Products currently valued at 13.5 times operating cash flow, notably lower than its five-year average cash flow multiple of 17.4, now seems like a great time to gas up on this leading dividend stock.', 'Lee Samaha (MSC Industrial): This is going to be a challenging year for MSC Industrial Direct.

MSC Industrial is a metalworking and maintenance, repair, and operations products and services distributor, so its sales are governed by manufacturing conditions and susceptible to changes in its customers' manufacturing activity and the industrial sector at large."", ""That's bad news in slowing conditions, as of now, but it's nothing that won't turn around with lower interest rates taking the brakes off the economy later in the year. In addition, while conditions are softening now, there's an underlying trend for manufacturing to reshore to the United States."", ""In addition, MSC Industrial is improving the quality of its earnings by increasing its installed base of vending machines and its sales through customer locations accordingly. Meanwhile, investors can earn a well-covered dividend, currently yielding 3.3%, while they wait for conditions to improve.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'As you can see below, Walt Disney had US$47.7b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$7.19b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$40.5b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Walt Disney had liabilities of US$31.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$61.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.19b and US$14.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$71.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Walt Disney has a huge market capitalization of US$205.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""Walt Disney has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 6.8 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. It is well worth noting that Walt Disney's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 54% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Walt Disney's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. In the last three years, Walt Disney's free cash flow amounted to 43% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness."", ""On our analysis Walt Disney's EBIT growth rate should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Walt Disney is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Walt Disney is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Fools, how are you doing?"", 'Andy Cross: Hey, Ron.', 'Emily Flippen: Hey.', ""Ron Gross: Fools, earnings season rolls on. We've got a lot to talk about. Today, we're going to talk acquisitions and e-commerce, but we must begin with Nvidia. On Thursday, Nvidia reported results that knocked it out of the park, and management provided guidance that was higher than analysts were expecting. Andy, I'm not even sure where to begin. This was really some report. The stock's performance is outstanding. What stood out to you? Where do we go from here?"", ""Andy Cross: Ron, these are like monopoly numbers. Nvidia has become the bellwether stock for this rally. It's up more than 60% this year alone, 275% for the past year. Since those earnings came out, team, it's added around $300 billion in market cap to be close to that $2 trillion level. That's the size of AMD. It's like a close competitor. The growth has been insane, so quickly, the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 22% from the third quarter, up 265% from a year ago. This is for a $2 trillion dollar company, don't forget. Earnings at $5.16, up 486% from a year ago. The data center revenues, that's the biggest part of their business and what is driving so much of the growth, up more than 400%."", ""When you think about what the world is spending on right now, it is so much in artificial intelligence technology, driven by Nvidia, the Hopper GPU for training and inferencing these large language models. With about half the revenues coming from these large cloud providers like Meta, like Microsoft, like AWS, revenue for China fell significantly, and those were really the only weak spots when you think about what happened. Growth accelerated through the year. For the full year, growth was up more than 120%. Again, 120% for the year, and more than 275% for the quarter. Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO, said we've hit a tipping point in generative AI."", ""Generative AI is the new application. It's enabling new ways to create software. It's a new way of computing, and this is enabling a whole new industry. Now you just see this massive growth going into the biggest part of their business, which is data center revenues. Gaming was still pretty nice, was up 15% for the entire full year. Automotive was up 20% for the full year, down for the quarter. CFO Colette Kress expects demand to far exceed supply for these next-gen products. This quarter they are expecting similar growth rates. You just don't see this kind of performance, such a large company, and Nvidia is just clearly not just knocking it out of the park, they're setting the park. If it's an artificial intelligence park, I don't know what, but these performance numbers are really outstanding."", ""Emily Flippen: It's actually amazing they're not more supply constrained than they are, because think about the businesses that can support this amount of growth. Like if you come to Chipotle and you're looking at a 100% increase in Chipotle, they're out of guac. They haven't had the opportunity to even meet that demand. The fact a year ago, management was talking about the demand cycle. They saw it coming down the pipeline. They communicated it to investors and they said, this is what we're ramping up for, and investors, myself included, were maybe a little bit skeptical and said these projections are insane. Here's the reality, they're not insane."", ""Andy Cross: It's a really interesting advantage they have is in the manufacturing because these chips they're making are so complex. They've done this for so long and invested so much into this with their partners like TSMC. They really have an edge there. What was really interesting from the call is they said that about 40% of their revenue is for the inference revenues. That's like when you do a prompt on generative AI and you get an answer, and that was really encouraging for the future growth in the chip spending for Nvidia. That was a little bit of light they shined on in the quarter."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Etsy and Wayfair reported results. Etsy's results were mixed and shares fell while Wayfair showed improved results and the stock was up 10%. Emily, any similarities here in these reports? What's Wayfair doing that Etsy isn't?"", ""Emily Flippen: This is a great example of don't judge a company by a single quarter, because if you look at these two quarters as you just mentioned, Ron, it makes it seem like, oh, Wayfair's executing right, those costs are coming down and Etsy is struggling. In reality, both of these businesses are struggling a bit, although Etsy has a better track record, I think, of proving out the usefulness of its platform in comparison with someone like Wayfair who has struggled to maintain its strategy, especially in the world post-pandemic. But both of these companies do have a similarity, as you mentioned Ron, which is both of these platforms right now are pretty out of favor. Wayfair is struggling to increase demand even as consumers remain relatively resilient."", 'If you look at just their results, their active customers over the course of the year were flat, but within the quarter as well as throughout the entirety of 2023, their lifetime revenue per active customer and their average order value all declined. The good news for Wayfair in the quarter was just the fact that they were able to cut costs. Any margin expansion is them just trying to narrow the size of their business despite the fact that their top line has been so paltry. Etsy, on the other hand, I think has struggled to maintain growth in the post-pandemic world, in the sense that its growth has continuously grown smaller than the e-commerce sector at large.', ""If you look at this quarter, this is their second full year of negative GMS growth, that's their gross merchandise sales. The second full year of negative growth, which of course is below industry averages. Both these companies, I think, are still going back to the drawing board to say, what can we do to drive consumers to our platform? Because it's not enough to say high interest rates are driving consumers away. Because we see time and time again from other consumer-facing businesses, people are willing to spend, just not here."", 'Ron Gross: Is it fair to say that Etsy is more discretionary spending focused and Wayfair has some non-discretionary and could that be impacting results?', ""Emily Flippen: I think that's fair. I will say I think Etsy has an understanding about where it stands in the consumer cycle more than something like Wayfair does. Wayfair has a ton of competitors. They're a known website, but they don't get as much direct traffic as say, Etsy. They spend more money to acquire those customers. They're competing with the Amazons of the world in a way that Etsy just isn't. They have a distinct brand at Etsy, which I think benefits them a bit more, despite the fact that what people are purchasing are things like gifts or presents, which can be, to your point, more discretionary."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, a 9% increase in its dividend, and plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio to boost its ad business. Andy, a lot to unpack here. Results look good. The acquisition is interesting to me. What's your headline here?"", 'Andy Cross: Hard to find a mass retailer with a better quarter than Walmart. As you mentioned, e-commerce sales were up 23% for the quarter. Walmart U.S. gains in grocery and those e-commerce sales were up 17% in the U.S. Global advertising was up 33%, with EPS, earnings per share, up $1.80, handily beating estimates. Generated $15 billion in free cash flow for the year, up $3 billion. Ron, as you mentioned, boosted that dividend 9%, which was the highest in 10 years. But what was really interesting was this acquisition of Vizio. It had been rumored for a week or so. It was a $2.3 billion acquisition, so not very large for the likes of someone like Walmart.', 'But as CEO Doug McMillon said, ""This acquisition accelerates the build-out of our advertising platform into the connected TV business,"" and Vizio has this SmartCast operating system. It\'s going to connect with the Walmart Connect ad platform. I think it\'s a really interesting, reasonably priced way for Walmart to continue to build out that advertising network. Interesting, you saw a lot of those adtech companies fall off on this news because now all of a sudden you have one of the best operators in the world, really making a deeper push into connected television advertising. Vizio has 500 direct advertising partners and many of them are part of the Fortune 500, so it\'s a really good fit for Walmart.', 'Ron Gross: Fifty-first consecutive year of dividend increases, 25 times forward earnings for Walmart. Do you like the stock?', ""Andy Cross: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. Don't expect the massive growth because they are really looking and pushing aggressively into these, what we all thought were like side businesses, but very much could be core. Also, their international business is doing quite well, too."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Teladoc reported a fourth-quarter loss that was less than expected, but sales were disappointing and management issued weak forward guidance. Emily, the stock got whacked. Is Teladoc's growth story officially coming to an end here?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think Teladoc's growth story has been coming to an end for a pretty extensive period of time. I know a lot of people will point to the pandemic as an indicator that this telemedicine provider was always going to be something that people only used when they were stuck at home, and that of course, people go back to their doctors' offices whenever the pandemic has let up. Certainly, there has been some of that, but I think that oversimplifies the story of Teladoc, which is to say that the thesis behind this business was that they were going to spend immediately of a lot of money up front to acquire and roll up all of these smaller telemedicine providers until they were the dominant force."", ""They have a fair amount of relationships with healthcare plans, but that roll-up strategy ended up being incredibly expensive at a time when the businesses that they were acquiring were just trading at insane valuations, which made it really challenging for Teladoc to actually gain market share, as well as drive profitability. We're still seeing the outfall of that today. That was what we saw in this most recent quarter, which was sales growth was pretty paltry, only around 4%. Indicators for that slowdown, especially in margin expansion, to continue. But they are still looking to improve their business. Now, I will say this, that margin expansion they're aiming for, they're saying 5,200 basis points of margin expansion for adjusted EBITDA over the next three years, each year. It's always good to be like, hey, look, we're driving profitability, but gosh, 5,200 basis points with this company is not enough. In this past quarter, they had 260 basis points of expansion. That just shows you how much that slowdown is happening in terms of their margin."", ""Ron Gross: Coming up, we'll talk cybersecurity and an acquisition in the banking sector. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here in studio with Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. On Tuesday, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks reported results that were not met with enthusiasm. It wasn't necessarily the quarterly results, but more so a change to its strategy that's spooked investors. Emily, results didn't seem to warrant a 25% drop in the stock. What's the problem with the new strategy that has investors running for the door?"", ""Emily Flippen: Just looking at the quarter as you mentioned, things look great, that's 16% billings growth. Whatever strategy Palo Alto has been implementing to this point, has worked for the stock, it's worked for investors. So when the management came out and said, hey, we had 16% of billings growth this quarter, but we think that's going to be 2%-3% next quarter. Investors shot first and asked questions later, which is understandable. In addition with Palo Alto falling, a lot of other cybersecurity companies start falling as well. Which begs the question of, is this a slowdown in demand for cybersecurity in general, or is this a Palo Alto-specific issue? The answer, in my opinion, is very much the latter."", ""Palo Alto is implementing a change in their kind of, I wouldn't call strategy, I'd say tactics of way of acquiring customers, which is to say when companies are in the process of shifting their security to the cloud, they're oftentimes working with numerous different vendors, all of which Palo Alto seeks to replace. It can make that transition challenging for them. Palo Alto historically, alongside other companies, has been transitioning and charging full up front despite the fact that that company may be working with different vendors. Under their new strategy, what they're effectively doing is providing their services for free until those existing vendor contracts end later on. This could be a period of effectively years. But management thinks that this is going to accelerate their long-term revenue growth even though it shows a slowdown in the short term and that this could theoretically be a more offensive strategy to gain market share in an industry that is becoming increasingly competitive."", 'Ron Gross: Price wars maybe in the future here as a result of this move.', ""Emily Flippen: That's what a lot of people are saying, but I think it still remains TBD whether or not companies like CrowdStrike, for instance, are really going to feel the need to provide their platform for free when they've managed to convert so many enterprise spenders with full payments right up front."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Capital One announced that it would acquire Discover Financial in an all-stock transaction worth $32.3 billion. This deal would combine two of the largest credit card companies in the U.S. Andy, what's got Capital One interested in Discover? Do you like the deal?"", ""Andy Cross: Yeah, it's really about the network. So buying that Discover network, it's one of the major ones with Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Granted, it's much smaller than those, based on data from our sister company, The Ascent, reports that Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have about 96% market share of payment volume with Discovery at 4%. So it's much smaller but it's unique. Capital One now is going out to spend an all-stock deal valued about $35 billion to acquire this network and that network that they'll be able to bring into their family and start to move some of their Mastercard and Visa credit cards over to Discover family."", ""When you start thinking about what Richard Fairbank, the co-founder and CEO of Capital One, calls the Holy Grail, to be both an issuer and a network provider. That's real magic because it starts to connect them with those merchants that Discover has that Capital One just didn't have access to. It is not a sure thing. The stock's at about $120-ish and the deal point would be at about $140. There's some concern that regulatory issues are going to keep this deal from happening. But overall, if you're a Cap One shareholder, I think that's a good deal for you to buy this. It could dilute a little bit of the book value, but overall, I think the long-term picture for Cap One with Discover is pretty bright."", 'Ron Gross: Banking sector always controversial, especially within the Senate. It is an election year. Do you think we will have some senators here, some government officials here clamoring for this deal not to get done?', ""Andy Cross: We're already seeing it. Senator Warren's come out pretty aggressively saying don't do the deal. They do expect it to close late 2024, or early 2025. I can't see a closing this year. If it gets through it will probably be early next year. But I do think it'll get very high scrutiny and that's one reason why the stock is not really that close to the acquisition price."", 'Ron Gross: Would you recommend an arbitrage here?', ""Andy Cross: I would not arbitrage the stock. I think if you're a Discover shareholder, hold onto your shares."", 'Ron Gross: Sounds good. On Thursday, MercadoLibre reported solid sales results, but earnings were hurt by what appears to be two non-recurring tax charges. Emily, first, are the charges really non-recurring? Second, how do results look if we adjust for them?', ""Emily Flippen: To answer your question with a non-answer, yes and no. It is not recurring in the sense that the business in this most recent quarter is recognizing a lot of expenses associated with the change in tax status right up front, when less than 1% of that is actually attributable to their actions over the last quarter. You can understand why they backed that out. But yes, it can be recurring in the sense that management did say that moving forward under these new tax rules, they're going to have around $20 million a quarter in incremental charges."", ""In addition to that, they have this lawsuit that they are expecting that they're now going to lose it. It seems to be non-material for the business moving forward, stemming from some rather old liability associated with its business over the past decade. But all those expenses being recognized in the quarter did bring that non-adjusted number down. But even if you just back out those numbers, results still came in a bit less than what the market expected."", ""The good news is sales were strong, so the stock is not down massively. The thesis for MercadoLibre hasn't been broken, but they did fail to keep up with the pace of inflation in Argentina, which resulted in the margin of sales coming from that country to be a little bit lower. I think investors should continue to really watch the fintech business here, though. This is the driving force, what I believe to be the driving force behind MercadoLibre's profitability, which is their expansion of credit offerings, debit cards, bank accounts. All of which continue to explode."", ""Andy Cross: When you think about that fintech business that Emily just talked about, the performance of non-performing loans due 90 days or longer fell from almost 30% to 18.7% this quarter over the past year. That's a good sign. They're seeing less and less on the non-performing side. But they have increased the provision to those doubtful accounts to the highest of the year. I think there is maybe perhaps some investor concern that it is going to be a little bit more challenging environment for them. But the fintech side, aside for Mercado Libre, what I think it's just continues to be interesting is the logistics business."", ""They shipped 407 million items. That was up 31%, next-day items shipped was up 21% year over year. Now almost 50% of all the products they ship go across the MercadoLibre logistics business. Again, they just continue to build out that ecosystem. They've a little budding streaming business. I just really liked the way they are positioning themselves, but there are all these macro factors that investors have to watch and we certainly watch them over in Stock Advisor."", ""Ron Gross: On Friday, stock was down about 10%. I'm still not really seeing the reason for it. Do you think that potentially could be overblown?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think there's an expectation now with those impending tax charges that their margin's going to be just mildly lower than what analysts expect. That combined with the failure in expansion of profitability and inflation, Argentina, probably just lowered expectations."", ""Ron Gross: All right, Fools, we'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, a conversation with Bloomberg reporter Kurt Wagner about Twitter and his book, The Battle for the Bird. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Kurt Wagner, a Bloomberg reporter covering social media companies and author of the new book, The Battle for the Bird. They discussed Twitter's early days, lessons from Musk's takeover, and what makes the old Twitter so hard to replicate."", ""Deidre Woollard: I love this book. I love the idea of the history of Twitter, and you go back before everything really started getting crazy. I want to take the listeners back because I want to start with a couple of alternate universe questions because you talk about 2015. Twitter's casting around for a new CEO before bringing back Jack Dorsey, and they look at Andy Jassy, who now of course is Amazon CEO, but was running AWS at that point. Probably a better move for him. But what might Twitter be like with someone a little more organized at the helm?"", 'Kurt Wagner: Maybe more traditional.', 'Deidre Woollard: Traditional is a good word.', ""Kurt Wagner: Traditional business mind. Well, certainly, a more lucrative decision for Andy Jassy to stay working at Amazon. But the reason the board came to this conclusion as they thought at the time that Twitter's biggest issue was the product. They really thought if they could figure out how to grow the product, how to create maybe some killer features that the business would follow and so as a result, Jack Dorsey felt like the product choice here, Andy Jassy felt more like the business choice."", ""He was someone who obviously had a ton of success, but in enterprise software, not necessarily consumer products, and so they ultimately went with Jack Dorsey. It's a fun thought experiment to think like what would Twitter have looked like? Actually, a lot of people don't realize there's a decent chunk of Twitter's business that was related to the API into data-sharing and things like that, and maybe that would have become a much larger thing under someone like Andy Jassy, just given his background, but we'll never really know. They thought that Jack was the product guy that they needed and that's obviously in the direction that they went."", 'Deidre Woollard: Another alternative universe question I have for you is about when Disney and Salesforce were hovering around thinking about buying Twitter. Disney got pretty close, which I found surprising. I know that they, at one point, were thinking of almost buying BuzzFeed. What do you think Twitter would have been like if the deal went through with Disney, would it still exist?', ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I think it would have because the way that Disney was thinking about Twitter at that time was as a streaming service. A lot of people might not remember. But in 2016 when these conversations were happening, Twitter was really pushing into live video. They wanted to be like a TV on the internet. They were streaming Thursday Night Football games. They were making deals with all kinds of other content partners and that was what attracted Disney, was this idea that maybe they could take their catalog of high-quality content and get it to people through Twitter. You look at what Disney+ is right now, for example. It's possible that, that could have been like a role that Twitter played had this acquisition happened or in some way, maybe Twitter would have shifted and looked very different than it does today. But I do think it would have existed because the thing that Disney wanted it for is something that the company is still very much doing."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I find this fascinating with video because Twitter, they got it early on, they got it ahead of everybody, and they struggled with it. You've got the shutdown of Vine and Periscope. You've got these repeated mis-swings. You just talked about the Thursday Night Football. They keep building it, but then they keep not really being successful with it. What made this so hard to master for them?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, the execution was obviously poor. I think when you think about what the Vine, for those who might not remember Vine was this short, six-second looping video. The people who used it were very creative. There was a whole community and culture that had been built around Vine, and it was very reminiscent, or sorry, very similar, I should say, to what we now see with TikTok. Twitter at the time had TikTok in the building, but they didn't nail it, and the biggest I think issue that I gathered was around this time, they were doing three different video offerings at once. All three were led by different people."", ""All three were competing for resources internally, there was no real cohesive effort. They had Periscope, which was live video. They had this professional produced live stuff, the TV stuff we talked about with the NFL, and then they had Vine and there was just no cohesion between those three. They were competitive. This, in my opinion, is one of the biggest mistakes that Jack Dorsey made when he came back was not figuring out a way to bring this strategy together. As a result, even though they were early to a lot of these things, they didn't execute on them well enough to ultimately establish themselves, I guess, as the premier place for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: I feel like they didn't give it enough time, either, especially with Vine because what you just talked about, I mean, you had proto-influencers. You had people that were doing stunts and things like that. It was pretty sticky and Periscope was less so, but Vine was interesting."", ""Kurt Wagner: Well, and one of the big things I think with Vine is, I don't think they ever did enough to convince creators that that was worth their time. Imagine you're a young internet creator. You're creating these fun videos, you built an audience on Vine. Well, at a certain point, you're looking to make money. Twitter and Vine were not offering them the ways to make money that YouTube was, that Instagram would eventually go on to do. If you're someone who that is your livelihood, you're going to go to the place where you can make some money and so I think they were just too slow to recognize that, hey, we have this great community. We need to figure out how they can stay self-sustainable, and they just didn't pivot quick enough to do that for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, before Elon enters the room, we've got Elliott Investment Management. They pop up in the book. I've seen a lot of Elliott in the news lately. They've been looking at Crown Castle, which is a tower REIT I follow. They've been looking at Match, Phillips 66.\xa0What did you learn about Elliott's style by researching what they were doing with Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: It's a pretty simple style, which is what can we do to make the most money? They don't really worry a ton about the collateral damage. In Twitter's case it was, OK, we have this service that's incredibly popular, but we have a guy who's running it who has another full-time job like this just does not equate. Like the thought was, Twitter would simply be worth more money and would be more valuable if the person running it did it as a full-time job."", ""It's a hard thing to argue. Most companies of that size should have a full-time CEO, and so they came in with that mindset like, hey, it's nothing personal. Jack, we don't dislike you as a person But the fact that you're running two jobs, it hurts the value of this company and we need to figure that out. I really liked this chapter and I really liked to digging in on this because it was a really fascinating business clash to watch this activist investor try and boot the CEO from the company while the board of directors is actively fighting to keep him. Ultimately, I would say the board won in the short term, Jack got to keep his job."", 'They had to make a bunch of I guess, concessions to Elliott in order for that to happen. But in the long term, I think Elliott actually got what they wanted, which was they got a much more focused company. They got some very specific goals around the business, around user growth, around revenue, things like that, that Twitter had never had to do before. Ultimately, Jack Dorsey left the company about 18 months later, and I think a big reason was that this had burnt him out and this had really bothered him. Even though he got to keep his job short-term, I think Elliot got what they wanted in the long term, which was that full-time CEO for Twitter.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned that it was nothing personal, but he took it personally and I think that's something that he has in common with Elon Musk, is this idea of taking business things really personally. So the relationship between them is interesting and we knew that Musk loves Twitter, but the relationship between Musk and Dorsey I found really interesting in the book because it gives us a good flavor that there's a mutual admiration society there. But then it seems like there's been less of that over time. So I think I see some of the ways that they're similar but tell me a little bit about where they're similar and where they differ."", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll start with the differences because I think they're more striking. I think the way that these two choose to manage and lead is very different. Jack was very thoughtful, almost to a fault. He was generally slow. He was hands-off. He didn't like to make a ton of decisions. He'd like to empower the people who reported him to do that. He served as an advisor, if you will. Then Elon is the exact opposite. He runs a million miles per hour. He makes all the decisions himself. He doesn't necessarily care too much about the feelings of his employees. He's just working toward his ultimate mission and if you get in the way, you either run with him or you get run over. So I think from a management standpoint, they were incredibly different."", ""Where I think they were similar is that I think jack had this idealistic vision for Twitter about what it could be or maybe should be, if it wasn't a publicly traded company and I think Elon bought into that or agreed with that. I think where they met was like, OK, we manage things differently. We treat people differently, but our vision for what Twitter could be or should be is the same and that's where they shook hands and seemed to be on the same page. Now, obviously, I don't think that's materialized in the way that certainly Jack Dorsey had envisioned but I think there's also something to be said about being rich and being a founder. It's a small crew, it's a small social circle of billionaire tech founders. So I think sometimes people who are in that circles gravitate toward one another simply because there's very few people in the world who can relate to what they go through, what their life is like, and I'm sure that there was some of that as well."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about when he comes in. He comes into this company, he brings a sink in the building, it's all nuts. It's like a how-not-to, because there's layoffs, there's chaos, there's a climate of fear, there's just bad communication, there's threats. Is there any positive lessons that we can learn from the general disaster that happens when he decides to take over?"", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll maybe give him two, I don't even know if they're compliments, but I'll maybe say there's two things that maybe were on the right track at least to start. The one is like when you take over a company like this, being very dramatic in terms of your changes, I actually think is an OK thing to do. Twitter was in a rut. It had spent a long summer as we've talked about with the lawsuit and all these things and I think the idea of coming in and really trying to be radically different is actually OK. I don't think he executed on this idea very well, but I think in theory, being radically different wasn't necessarily a bad idea. The other thing that I think he did or at least the intentions were there to do, was he moves very fast."", ""Twitter had a history of moving very slowly, of second-guessing themselves, of taking forever to launch things and this idea that Elon had came in and wanted to move quickly and was willing to literally sleep at the office to get things done, set it set that example for people. I don't think that's healthy work-life balance by any stretch, but I do think there's something to be said about his willingness to move fast in the tech world can be somewhat commendable sometimes. Now, again, I don't think he executed either these things very well. I think he didn't really have a set plan when he came in and then the moving too quickly actually got them into more trouble because there was no plan that he was following. But I think on paper, those two things could have been positives had they been handled a little bit differently."", ""Deidre Woollard: The new X, it's a different place. I've been on there, I think I joined Twitter in like 2008. I tried to move on, I'm trying -- I've tried Threads, Jack Dorsey's got Bluesky. Nothing has quite measured up so far. So is Twitter like a time-and-place phenomenon, do you think? Or is there room for the next big short message social media service? If so, do you see anything? What are you using? Are you still on Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I am still on Twitter. Now X, of course. I like to think that I'm mostly there because I cover the company, but to be honest, I still do get some real value out of it. I'm a big sports fan and like the sports news and sports community on Twitter, I think is one of the things that has actually been able to stay somewhat strong. But I've been thinking a lot about this, like can Twitter be replicated? I'm not so sure that it can, for a couple of reasons. No. 1, the thing that made Twitter so unique and great was that pretty much everyone felt that they needed to be on it in terms of celebrity. So if you're a politician, if you're a musician, if you're a journalist, if you're a celebrity of some kind, there was this feeling that you had to be on Twitter because that's where people talked about things in public. I'm not sure you could convince that collection of people that they need to be anywhere in 2024 or beyond."", ""I think we've gotten to this point in social media where people, 10-15 years ago thought it was a necessity. Now people have realized, well, there are pros and cons of social media, but it's not something I have to do. So that's what to me made Twitter so unique was like the collection of people who you could hear from, quite frankly, on a regular basis. I just don't think you could convince all those people to come back and then as a result, you're never going to have that community in one place again. I think we're seeing that right now with how things are starting to splinter. As you mentioned, Threads or Bluesky or even Instagram. Obviously, it's not Twitter, but it's a place where I think people have migrated or said like, OK, I don't have my Twitter anymore. I'll focus on Instagram instead. So it's hard for me to imagine all those groups coming back together in one place again."", ""Ron Gross: Coming up after the break, Emily Flippen and Andy Cross return with a couple of stocks on their radar.

Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Ron Gross here with Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. Fools, we've got time for one quick story before we hit stocks on our radar. Beginning Feb. 26, KFC is introducing for the very first time in the U.S., its international smash hit Chizza. Featuring two 100% white meat, extra crispy fillets topped with marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni. So Fools, what do you think? Would you try it? Will it be a hit in the U.S.? Emily, you are up."", 'Emily Flippen: Did you just asked me if I\'ve ever had Parmesan chicken? [laughs] That\'s what this is. You\'re breading a piece of chicken, covering it in marinara sauce, and then putting cheese on it, then selling it as a ""limited time offering,"" like I\'ve never had chicken Parmesan.', ""Ron Gross: That's fascinating."", 'Andy Cross: Emily is not doing the piece of pepperoni.', ""Emily Flippen: That's true."", ""Andy Cross: Add that into and it's a completely different animal, plus you got to eat it on just with at the bottom.\xa0How do you hold the thing to eat it on a piece of paper? I'm just curious in how you eat it."", ""Ron Gross: Knife and fork, I'm guessing."", 'Andy Cross: Knife and fork? No way. [laughs] You just devour that thing.', ""Ron Gross: All right, Fools. We've got a couple of stocks on our radar and I'll bring in our man, Dan Boyd, to ask a question and pick his favorite. Emily, you are up first. What do you got?"", ""Emily Flippen: The stock on my radar this week is Grab. The ticker is G-R-A-B. For investors who are unfamiliar, Grab is based out of Southeast Asia. It operates a little bit like Uber Eats or Grubhub, where they have mobility, they have transportation, delivery, logistics. A one-stop shop of sorts. They came out and they posted their first ever quarterly profit this quarter, fourth quarter 2023. They also approved a $500 million share repurchase plan, which is really interesting. The company doesn't have absurd stock-based compensation, but it does have a ton of cash on its balance sheet. So what they're saying is effectively, well, in the meantime, while we figure out what to do with this cash, why not reward some shareholders through share repurchases? What I'm continuing to watch, though, is just how they manage their incentive payments to drive expansion in both active customers and the number of orders. They've had a 12% increase in transacting users over the last quarter, which is great. But I want to see those incentive payments continue to come down."", 'Andy Cross: Dan, you got a question about Grab?', ""Dan Boyd: So I'd never heard of this stock before Emily brought it to the show. I was looking it up and I still don't really understand what they do. Emily, could you give us a quick primer?"", 'Emily Flippen: Have you have you gotten an Uber before? Have you ordered Grubhub or Uber Eats? Have you sent a package to somebody you love? There you go. You got Grab.', ""Ron Gross: I'm still not sure what they do. Andy, you're up. What are you looking at?"", ""Andy Cross: Team, I'm looking at HubSpot, H-U-B-S, a subscription CRM tool, customer relationship management to more than 205,000 customers who rely on that tool, especially small, medium-sized businesses, $30 billion company, $600 stock price. The stock's up 55% in the past year. It's growing about 25% and sells for about 14 times multiple on those sales. What's really interesting is they have recently announced a new pricing scheme. So they provide these hubs that around operations, content management, customer service for these clients, sales of the big usage of them. They are now doing a new pricing plan that removes some of the seat limitations.\xa0It's easier to upgrade, aligns the pricing with some of the new CRM tools and some of the new AI stuff there they're inputting for. So that's going to hit in March, so I'm really watching to see how that impacts both their subscriber base as well as some of their revenue numbers."", 'Ron Gross: Dan?', ""Dan Boyd: So this company, they don't make hubcaps?"", 'Andy Cross: They do not make hubcaps. But I believe they probably help a company that does make hubcaps.', ""Ron Gross: Dan, we've got Grab Holdings and HubSpot, neither of which you understand, what are you putting on your watch list?"", ""Dan Boyd: This is a tough one, Ron.

Fell 9.5% Short Of Analyst Revenue Estimates And Analysts Have Been Revising Their Models",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revenue-miss-oneok-inc-fell-143728850.html,1709390248,STORY,['OKE'],"[""It's been a good week for ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest full-year results, and the shares gained 3.0% to US$75.13. Revenues came in 9.5% below expectations, at US$18b. Statutory earnings per share were relatively better off, with a per-share profit of US$5.48 being roughly in line with analyst estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK ', ""Following the latest results, ONEOK's ten analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$24.3b in 2024. This would be a substantial 37% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 7.7% to US$4.91. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$24.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.15 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$77.73, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values ONEOK at US$87.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$62.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting ONEOK's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 37% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 17% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 1.7% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect ONEOK to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for ONEOK. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for ONEOK going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""And what about risks?

Its high-margin output helped fuel strong free cash flow, and the oil company returned the bulk of that money to shareholders via a gusher of dividends and share repurchases. ', ""Devon doesn't expect to set another production record in 2024, though. Instead, it plans to trim its capital spending, which will impact its production. However, that strategy positions it to produce even more free cash in 2024 if oil prices cooperate, potentially giving it more money to return to investors. "", 'On Tuesday, Devon Energy reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results. The oil company produced 662,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) during the fourth quarter, including 317,000 barrels of oil per day. That exceeded the high end of its guidance range. Meanwhile, total production for the year averaged 658,000 BOE/d (up 8% from 2022), while crude oil output averaged a record-setting 320,000 barrels per day. The oil and natural gas company benefited from two acquisitions that closed in 2022 (Validus Energy and RimRock Oil & Gas), as well as solid organic production growth fueled by its Delaware Basin position. ', ""Devon's record-setting oil output helped it produce $2.7 billion in free cash flow last year. While that was down sharply from the record $6 billion it generated in 2022, it was still a solid result considering that oil and natural gas prices were much lower while capital expenses increased. Devon used that excess cash to pay more than $1.8 billion in dividends (fixed and variable) and repurchase $979 million in stock. The company's total dividend payments gave it a 7% yield relative to its current stock price. Meanwhile, it has repurchased 6% of its outstanding shares since late 2021. "", ""Devon Energy doesn't expect 2024 will be another record year for oil output. The company recently reaffirmed its 2024 outlook, which would see production average 650,000 BOE/d, with crude output of about 315,000 barrels per day. That oil production level would be about flat compared to its 2023 exit rate of 317,000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, natural gas production would decline as the company focuses on drilling in higher-margin oil-focused regions. "", ""The company's production will dip this year because it plans to trim its capital spending by about 10% to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. Driving that decline is lower service costs and a focus on becoming more efficient. "", '""Looking ahead to 2024, we have designed a plan to deliver a step-change improvement in capital efficiency,"" stated CEO Rick Muncrief in the fourth-quarter earnings press release. ""By allocating additional capital to the core of the Delaware Basin and high-grading activity across our diversified portfolio, we expect to efficiently sustain our oil production for roughly 10% less capital."" ', 'That reduced capital spending positions Devon Energy to produce more free cash flow this year. At $80 a barrel oil (which is just above where West Texas Intermediate crude was trading this week), it could produce $3.2 billion in free cash flow, about 20% more than last year. ', ""Devon plans to return 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders through its base dividend (which it will increase by 10% this year), share repurchases, and variable dividends, while using the rest to further strengthen its balance sheet. While management has prioritized variable dividends in the past (targeting to pay up to 50% of its excess free cash flow in variable dividends), it will shift its focus in 2024 to share repurchases. With shares recently down more than 40% from the 8-year peak they reached in 2022, Devon trades at a dirt-cheap valuation. It trades at a 9% free cash flow yield at $75 a barrel oil, three times higher than the broader market (suggesting it's significantly cheaper). Because of that, it's on pace to retire 9% of its outstanding shares as it deploys what remains of its $3 billion repurchase authorization. "", ""Devon Energy delivered record oil output last year. However, that production growth didn't create value for investors. That's leading management to shift gears to focus on growing its free cash flow. The company hopes that producing more cash and using it to repurchase its now-cheap stock will help fuel stronger returns in 2024. That potential rebound makes Devon Energy a compelling investment opportunity these days."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

Mark, please go ahead."", ""Mark Hood: Good afternoon, and welcome to the P10 fourth quarter and year end 2023 conference call. Today, we will be joined by Luke Sarsfield, Chief Executive Officer and Amanda Coussens, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call, as well as the presentation slides may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain.

During the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the Company's performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Luke."", ""Luke Sarsfield: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, I'm going to provide an overview of our 2023 performance, share some key observations from my first four months as CEO and lay out our plan for the year ahead. P10 delivered strong fourth quarter and full year operating results in 2023, which demonstrated the strength of our strategies and our position as a leading specialized private market solutions platform. In 2023, we generated double-digit top line growth and strong profitability. For the full year, fee-paying AUM increased by 10%. Revenues increased by 22% and adjusted EBITDA rose by 16%. It bears repeating P10 surpassed its two-year gross fundraising expectations of $5 billion months early."", ""And by the end of 2023, we had raised an incremental $2 billion above our original target. Despite the underlying strength of our platform and our positive financial results, since going public in 2021, we continue to face pressure on our valuation. Across most metrics, we trade at a meaningful discount to our alternatives peer group. While we believe this presents a compelling entry point for investors today, we are focused on closing that relative valuation gap through strategic execution underscored by transparent communication. We believe that as we articulate and execute on our new strategic initiatives, the market will take notice and reward shareholders. When we talk about our ownership base, it's important to note that P10 employees make up the largest ownership position in our shareholder register."", ""This is a reflection of our collective conviction in the intrinsic value of our platform. We are firm believers that this ownership stake results and strong alignment between the Company and our broader shareholder base. During the fourth quarter, we bought back 859,600 shares at an average share price of $9.74. Further, our Board of Directors has approved a $40 million expansion of P10's current share repurchase program with $10.6 million remaining on our previous 20 million buyback authorization. We now have over 50 million available for repurchases. We have never been more confident in the franchise and its future and are evaluating every possible avenue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Since being appointed CEO in October, I have had the opportunity to holistically engage in almost every aspect of P10's operations that has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the organization."", 'It was important for me to get to know our teams and equally as critical for them to get exposure to me. I spent the last two months of 2023 on a listening tour across a broad array of constituencies visiting with them in person hearing their perspectives and gaining insights as to what P10 does well and learning how we can continue to enhance the organization and its processes. In addition to visiting with each of our strategies in person and engaging with our employees. I had the privilege to spend time with many of our clients and limited partners both current and prospective as well as our investors and analysts. With the benefit of that insight, I can say with confidence P10 is a world-class business made up of the leading minds in the middle market alternative investment space.', 'Moreover, our managers all have a world-class track record of investing excellence that has resulted in high levels of trust with our LPs. Trust is not something we can buy or create in the short term I take that trust very seriously and we plan to build on the immense credibility our managers have achieved in this next chapter of our growth. The solid foundation that has been built to-date will form the basis of our success going forward. As we look to 2024 and beyond, our strategic priorities are as follows. First, institutionalize our platform and optimize our corporate level organizational structure. Second, drive increased organic growth by expanding our existing client franchise through programmatic cross-selling and strategic partnerships.', ""Third implement a robust disciplined and process-driven approach to inorganic growth. Fourth generate operational efficiencies through incentivizing collaboration and leveraging data insights, and finally enhance our shareholder communications with an eye to greater visibility and transparency. These priorities set the stage for an exciting 2024 as we invest to accelerate profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. We have aggressive goals with a roadmap to achieve them executing on our plan will not occur overnight but progress will be evident as we report each quarter. We also plan to share more about our long-term strategy at P10's first Investor Day in the fall of this year. As I said at the beginning of the call P10 employees are firmly aligned with our shareholder base when we execute on this strategy all P10 stakeholder's benefit."", ""Now, let's dive a bit deeper on each of our priorities. First, we are going to institutionalize our platform and optimize our corporate level organizational structure. In a trust and performance business, our people are our greatest assets and we must set up an appropriate structure to drive success and accountability in this next phase of our growth. With that in mind, I would like to thank our retiring Chief Operating Officer, Fritz Souder for his contributions to P10. He was a founding partner at RCP and has done an outstanding job for our limited partners, our shareholders, and our employees. We thank Fritz for all he has done and wish him the very best. Our go-forward corporate level organizational structure has four key functional areas."", ""Each led by a Senior Executive Vice President level leader reporting directly to me. Our outstanding EVP, CFO and CCO, Amanda Coussens will continue to lead the finance, audit, accounting, legal, and compliance teams. Amanda's contributions to P10 cannot be overstated as she has helped build the strong financial and compliance functions that have positioned P10 for continued organic and inorganic growth. To further augment, our legal and compliance framework. She will lead the external search to identify and recruit General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer to further enhance our P10 control framework. Mark Hood has been elevated to the role of EVP of Operations and Chief Administrative Officer. In this newly created role Mark will oversee our operations, data and technology, human resources, public relations and communications and he will continue in his oversight of our Investor Relations function."", ""Mark has been foundational to P10 since its IPO and I'm incredibly excited about his expanded role. Next, I'm thrilled to report that we have hired a world-class professional to serve as our EVP Head of Strategy and M&A. Arjay Jensen is an incredibly talented seasoned professional with over 20 years of experience at Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities, and Perella Weinberg Partners. Arjay Jensen will oversee our corporate strategy and lead our corporate development and M&A activities, inorganic growth will be a core growth driver for P10 Arjay will be instrumental in building a scalable M&A blueprint identifying key strategic opportunities for P10 and executing on M&A transactions. Additionally we are going to continue to invest in our client franchise to lead this effort."", ""We are seeking an experienced industry veteran. This person will oversee our client organization, including client relationships, distribution, marketing and product development, and we'll work closely with client leaders across our various strategies. As we scale the platform, we're going to build a best-in-class distribution network for our products across strategies. We strongly believe the head of distribution will be critical to maximizing value of each client relationship. Given the importance of finding the right person for this role, we have retained a leading recruiting firm with deep expertise in this area and we are working closely with them in earnest to find the right leader for this function. Second, we plan to drive increased organic growth by expanding our existing client franchise through programmatic cross selling and strategic partnerships."", ""P10 is fortunate to have a large and growing global LP base and we need a scalable and replicable process for expanding our influence with current and prospective LPs. Our new Head of Distribution will be responsible for building this framework to demonstrate progress against our goals. We intend to provide additional details on this topic throughout 2024 culminating at P10's inaugural Investor Day this fall. Third, we are implementing a robust disciplined and process driven approach to inorganic growth. My background is in deal-making and in alternative asset management. I've spent decades doing those two things at the highest level and strongly believe that we are positioned to execute deals on a global scale. We plan to increase our footprint which will also enhance our relationship network."", ""This will mean navigating new jurisdictions and regulations and that's where we're going to be selective, but opportunistic in this pursuit. As our Head of M&A, Arjay Jensen will leverage his vast experience to reaccelerate our M&A engine. Fourth, we plan to drive operational efficiencies through incentivizing collaboration and leveraging data insights. As we focus on accelerated growth in 2025, we need to ensure our operational structure is optimized and designed to encourage efficiency and collaboration across our strategies. We also plan to share more data with the investment community in a format more aligned to our peers. We will communicate how we are leveraging the collective strengths of our platform more regularly. Finally, we plan to meaningfully enhance our shareholder communications with an eye to greater visibility and transparency."", ""I believe that in order to assess the progress we are making against these previous four initiatives. The investment community has a clear and understandable framework through which to evaluate P10's performance both on an absolute and a relative basis. As such we are going to begin rolling out KPI.s that allow our key stakeholders to get their arms around the huge opportunity we're capitalizing on. We will have more to report in future quarters as we work through specific details with our audit partners and Audit Committee and we look forward to updating you appropriately. Now let's turn to our outlook for 2024. Starting with fee-paying AUM, we anticipate we will organically raise more than 2.5 billion of gross new assets across the platform."", ""We expect double-digit revenue growth. That is driven both by this fundraising activity as well as positive fee rate dynamics. We also hope that in 2024 we will announce at least one strategic transaction. As it relates to adjusted EBITDA margin, we expect margins to average in the mid 40s excluding the effect of acquisitions. There are two dynamics at play here that I'd like to highlight. First is an ongoing mix shift within our existing portfolio of strategies. As we have previously noted some of our newer and faster-growing businesses such as Bonaccord, Park and WTI have lower core adjusted EBITDA margins than other parts of our business and the overall margin will continue to reflect this evolution. The second influence on margins is the critical and foundational human capital investments we are making in the business."", 'We expect these investments to drive core growth and provide a high ROI for investors. Aas we move into the new year we will begin using the common descriptor FRE or fee-related earnings in our financial reporting. Before I hand the call over to Amanda, I want to acknowledge some of the recent noise in the marketplace regarding a previously disclosed related party transaction with Crossroads. In step with enhanced transparency we want to speak directly and clearly on this matter. The transaction was reviewed, approved and disclosed in keeping with the appropriate governance controls P10 has in place. P10 not invest any capital in Crossroads. The institutional investors who did invest in Crossroads did so on a non-discretionary basis and conducted their own rigorous due diligence.', 'The transition of our founders and former co-CEOs had absolutely nothing to do with the related party transaction. Robert Albert and Clark Webb will continue in their current roles as Executive Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman respectively. Finally, the committee of our independent directors commissioned Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a third-party law firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the transaction. The committee, the broader board and the law firm all found our governance provisions were properly followed. To close, I want to remind shareholders that the fundamentals of P10’s business remain exceptionally strong. While we view this year as a table setting a year, ahead of acceleration in 2025 and beyond, we are a world-class platform that has momentum across world-class strategies.', ""We are committed to transparency and delivering our investors transparent disclosure. With that, I'll turn the call over to Amanda to further review our financial results."", 'Amanda Coussens: Thank you Luke. In the fourth quarter fee-paying assets under management were $23.3 billion, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter $860 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by $297 million and step-downs in exploration. In the first half of 2024, we estimate $1.2 billion and step-downs in explorations. For the second half of 2024, we estimate an additional $300 million. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $63.1 million, an 8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Year-over-year revenue increased from $198.4 million to $241.7 million, up 22%. Average fee rate in the fourth quarter was 109 basis points, driven by higher fee rates, direct strategies becoming a larger part of our fee-paying AUM.', ""Before I continue with our results, I'd like to provide insight into a one-time event that impacted the performance of our venture equity strategy TrueBridge in the fourth quarter. If not for this event, we would have recognized an additional $3.1 billion of revenue and $2.7 million of adjusted EBITDA. TrueBridge Global Premier-1 or TGP-1 was raised in 2022 with the objective of investing and all funds raised by an undisclosed managers global platform across key vintages, 2022 and 2024, 2025 TrueBridge closed TGP-1 with a total of $275 million of external LP capital, $250 million, we were confident of deploying and $25 million for reserves. TGP only charge management fees on the $250 million at a 1% rate. TGP-1 deployed just under 40% of its total fund size and the 2022 advantages with the remaining 60% planned for 2024 2025 vintages and reserves."", 'In late 2023, the undisclosed manager announced it would be separating a global platform by spinning out its India and China operations into their own independent firms. The TGP-1 mandate did not allow investments in these new independent firms. As a result we recommended that LPs vote to release all TGP-1 LPs from their uninvested capital and we distributed a consent election to that effect. The management fee from inception will be revised based on this new smaller fund size. In addition to preserve goodwill with our limited partners, we have waived 50% of the recalculated management fee from inception June 2022 to December 2023. Turning now to our other strategies. In the quarter, we had 12 funds in the market and saw broad participation across our platform.', 'Our private equity strategies raised and deployed $324 million, our venture equity strategy raised $299 million. Our credit fleet raised and deployed $209 million, also team contributed $28 million. P10 continues to benefit from strategies with long track records of generating durable alpha and offering best-in-class investment opportunities to our global investors. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $57.7 million, a 10% increase over the same period a year ago. For the full year 2023, operating expenses were $220.8 million, a 43% increase over 2022. The increase was primarily driven by additional compensation benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisition of Bonaccord, Hark and WTI. GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter was 1.9 million, a 139% decrease when compared to the year ago period.', 'On a year-over-year basis, GAAP net income decreased from $29.4 million to a net loss of $7.8 million. The GAAP net loss is primarily attributable to compensation expense and non-cash stock-based compensation related to the CEO transition and the acquisitions of Bonaccord Hark and WTI.

Shares sat out of the 2023 rally and have trailed the S&P 500 so far this year, too."", ""That performance could mean excellent returns from here if you don't already own the coffee titan's stock. Even if Starbucks is in your portfolio, you might want to add to your position. Here are a few good reasons why."", ""Starbucks reported a robust 5% comparable-store sales increase for the fiscal Q1 period that ran through late December. That result stacks up well against McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and its 3% uptick this past quarter."", ""It's always good news when your business is outgrowing industry peers. Better yet, looking beneath that headline figure shows even more evidence of solid demand at Starbucks' cafes."", ""The chain is getting its growth through higher customer traffic and increased average spending, for example. McDonald's had to rely entirely on increased spending to counteract weaker customer traffic in the core U.S. market."", 'Starbucks\' relative success here points to more market-share gains ahead and good momentum into 2024, even though the casual dining industry has been slowing. ""Despite headwinds, our brand is very strong,"" CEO Laxman Narasimhan said in a press release .', 'The news is more clearly positive when it comes to Starbucks\' finances. Profit margin jumped by more than a full percentage point last quarter to 16% of sales, leading to a 20% spike in non-GAAP earnings. ""I am proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter,"" CFO Rachel Ruggeri said, ""as it underscores our multiple paths to earnings growth.""', ""One of those paths involves pushing outside of Starbucks' traditional metropolitan focus into more rural locations, anchored by the drive-thru and to-go channels that are popular with consumers right now. The chain is getting a lift from its loyalty program, too, and by the launch of many more premium-drink options."", 'The bright side of the recent stock slump is that you can grab Starbucks stock for an attractive discount today. Shares are trading for 3x sales today, down from a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 4x sales less than a year ago. Its price-to-earnings multiple has dipped to 26x revenue from 36x sales over that same period.', ""Sure, the company is seeing new demand pressures right now due to slowing growth in the core U.S. market. These aren't permanent challenges, though, so it makes no sense to abandon the stock right now."", 'Be sure to keep an eye on customer traffic trends for signs that Starbucks is losing market share to rivals. To date, though, the chain is boosting that metric with help from a steady flow of innovative beverage releases and improvements to the shopping experience.', ""Another metric worth watching is Starbucks' operating profit margin, which recently crossed 16% of sales, putting it right on pace with Chipotle's impressive rate. The bullish investing thesis relies, in part, on this metric continuing to rise in 2024 and beyond.

There's a good reason it's so large, but size alone is no reason to buy the stock of a company. In fact, Prologis, despite being a well-run company, may be a less than desirable choice for some investors. Here's what you need to know."", 'Prologis owns warehouses, which is not unique at all in the REIT sector. What sets it apart from its peers is the size and diversification of its portfolio. Prologis owns 1.2 billion square feet of leasable space spread over 5,500 properties across four continents and 20 countries. No other warehouse REIT comes close to those statistics.', 'Notably, the properties Prologis owns are mostly located in key global distribution hubs. So not only is its portfolio big, but its properties are located where its over 6,700 customers want to operate. Given its scale, meanwhile, Prologis can actually offer something of a one-stop shop for customers with global operations.', ""On top of that, the company has been benefiting from leases ending and being resigned at materially higher rates. So there's built-in growth within the active properties it owns. Prologis, however, also owns over 12,000 acres of developable land around the world. That's another $40 billion growth opportunity, by management's estimate."", ""Now add in a decade of dividend growth at a compound annual rate of around 11%. That's an attractive track record for any company, but particularly impressive for a REIT. The most recent annual increase was 10%, so the company is still going strong on this measure. Given the business backdrop, meanwhile, there's good reason to think the dividend growth story will continue. If you are a dividend growth investor, Prologis could be a very attractive choice."", ""Prologis is currently offering investors a 2.8% dividend yield. If you're looking to live off of the income your portfolio generates, that probably won't be the least bit exciting to you. The average REIT, using Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) as a proxy, is offering a yield of over 4.1%. This is a dividend growth stock, not a high-yield stock."", ""That said, the dividend yield is around the middle of the road if you look at the REIT's yield range over the past decade. So while it would be hard to suggest the stock is cheap right now, it also doesn't look expensive, using yield as a rough proxy for valuation. If you're a growth-and-income or dividend growth-focused investor, a fair price for a well-positioned industry giant like Prologis is a pretty attractive proposition."", ""But the stock isn't trading at depressed levels, so value investors will probably also want to take a pass here. A yield above 3% would be a far more compelling entry point if you're value conscious. However, even that might not be enough to entice a yield-focused investor."", ""Prologis is not a value stock, and it's not a high yield stock. It will probably never be either of those things, given its strong industry position. But it is a solid option for dividend growth and growth-and-income investors. While it looks fully priced today, it's not a bad thing to pay a fair price for a well-run company if you have a long investment horizon."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Prologis wasn’t one of them.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) owns nearly 244 million shares of the oil and gas giant... a position that\'s been steadily added to since 2019 and is now worth a total of $14.5 billion. Buffett even mentioned Occidental\'s ""vast oil and gas holdings"" in his recent annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, underscoring the idea that the company is making adequate investments in its future supply of crude and natural gas.', 'However, there\'s something else Buffett said about Occidental Petroleum in his recently penned letter that deserves a closer look. He added that Berkshire Hathaway\'s a fan of the company\'s ""leadership in carbon-capture initiatives [even] though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven.""', 'The comment begs a couple of questions, the first of which is simply: What the heck is carbon capture?', ""You likely know that fossil fuels like oil, coal, and to some extent even natural gas aren't exactly environmentally friendly. Namely, using them creates by-products like carbon dioxide (or CO2), which can contribute to global warming."", 'Just as the name suggests, carbon capture prevents these carbon-based molecules from floating freely in the atmosphere and/or onto the ground.', ""It's easier said than done. That's why it hasn't really been done to any meaningful commercial degree."", ""In that technology begets more technology, however, the ability to trap carbon dioxide is not only improving, but approaching the point of being cost-effective. That's important too, since many of the world's top polluters will soon be paying for solutions allowing them to keep their net carbon footprint under control."", ""And none too soon. The United States' federal government has set a goal of becoming a net-zero emissions country by 2050. That's ambitious to be sure. But it's not out of the realm of possibility if we push the proverbial envelope."", 'Enter Occidental Petroleum.', 'Occidental Petroleum is one of the developers pushing that envelope. It may be pushing it more than any other organization, in fact.', ""Take its so-called STRATOS project in Ector County, Texas as an example. Although it's not yet up and running, BlackRock has committed $550 million of its own money to the joint venture that is expected to capture up to 500,000 tons of CO2 directly from the atmosphere every year beginning in mid-2025. Amazon and Airbus are just a couple of the companies that have already signed up as eventual paying customers when they're required to reduce their carbon footprint."", ""That's just the beginning, though. CEO Vicki Hollub feels that this atmospheric carbon capture tech could be licensed out to as many as 1,000 paying customers needing such tools to meet carbon emission requirement mandates in the future."", ""Better still, this captured CO2 doesn't simply need to be captured, but disposed of in a way that the world will never see it again. It can be utilized in a variety of ways. One of these ways is injecting into existing oil wells to extract more oil than would otherwise be drawn out using more typical pumping methods. This enhanced oil recovery (or EOR) technique can lower a well's overall emissions by roughly 70%."", ""This isn't mere theory based on a small-scale experiment, either. Occidental is already injecting CO2 into about 6,000 wells."", ""The company is also tinkering with other ways to use this captured CO2. For instance, it's working with a biotech firm to figure out ways to use it to create industrial chemicals and polymers that are not only needed, but ecologically sound. This work is still in its infancy, but it does hold promise."", ""As for the scope of the opportunity, Global Market Insights believes the worldwide carbon capture and storage market will swell from around $6 billion in 2022 to more than $35 billion in 2032. That's an annualized growth rate of more than 20% between now and then, jibing with an outlook from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Occidental won't win all of this business, but even just winning a healthy portion of it would still be a meaningful bump to its current yearly top line of just under $30 billion."", 'Perhaps just as important to Occidental Petroleum, however, is that these carbon capture initiatives promise to help crude oil remain far more marketable for far longer than many thought would be the case just a few years ago. Indeed, the energy sector could look forward to a few more decades of respectable demand, if only because the shift toward more renewable sources of energy is so slow-moving and expensive.', 'The hard part? Waiting. As Buffett also noted, ""[T]he economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven."" And to this end, Occidental doesn\'t have a revenue-bearing carbon capture business up and running yet.', ""Buffett's assessment arguably understates just how close this tech is to being economically viable, though. Occidental's developmental projections suggest that the current cost of around $500 to capture one ton of ambient carbon could be as much as halved within a decade with the development of better filters, ongoing design refinements, more scale, and the sociopolitical will to make it happen. Moreover, the prospect of de-carbonizing the fossil fuel that we're still going to desperately need for many more years seems like it's worth the wait. Warren Buffett certainly seems to think so, anyway."", 'And on a more philosophical note, kudos to the Oracle of Omaha for recognizing that doing something good for the planet can also be a good business opportunity.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

This was really some report. The stock's performance is outstanding. What stood out to you? Where do we go from here?"", ""Andy Cross: Ron, these are like monopoly numbers. Nvidia has become the bellwether stock for this rally. It's up more than 60% this year alone, 275% for the past year. Since those earnings came out, team, it's added around $300 billion in market cap to be close to that $2 trillion level. That's the size of AMD. It's like a close competitor. The growth has been insane, so quickly, the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 22% from the third quarter, up 265% from a year ago. This is for a $2 trillion dollar company, don't forget. Earnings at $5.16, up 486% from a year ago. The data center revenues, that's the biggest part of their business and what is driving so much of the growth, up more than 400%."", ""When you think about what the world is spending on right now, it is so much in artificial intelligence technology, driven by Nvidia, the Hopper GPU for training and inferencing these large language models. With about half the revenues coming from these large cloud providers like Meta, like Microsoft, like AWS, revenue for China fell significantly, and those were really the only weak spots when you think about what happened. Growth accelerated through the year. For the full year, growth was up more than 120%. Again, 120% for the year, and more than 275% for the quarter. Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO, said we've hit a tipping point in generative AI."", ""Generative AI is the new application. It's enabling new ways to create software. It's a new way of computing, and this is enabling a whole new industry. Now you just see this massive growth going into the biggest part of their business, which is data center revenues. Gaming was still pretty nice, was up 15% for the entire full year. Automotive was up 20% for the full year, down for the quarter. CFO Colette Kress expects demand to far exceed supply for these next-gen products. This quarter they are expecting similar growth rates. You just don't see this kind of performance, such a large company, and Nvidia is just clearly not just knocking it out of the park, they're setting the park. If it's an artificial intelligence park, I don't know what, but these performance numbers are really outstanding."", ""Emily Flippen: It's actually amazing they're not more supply constrained than they are, because think about the businesses that can support this amount of growth. Like if you come to Chipotle and you're looking at a 100% increase in Chipotle, they're out of guac. They haven't had the opportunity to even meet that demand. The fact a year ago, management was talking about the demand cycle. They saw it coming down the pipeline. They communicated it to investors and they said, this is what we're ramping up for, and investors, myself included, were maybe a little bit skeptical and said these projections are insane. Here's the reality, they're not insane."", ""Andy Cross: It's a really interesting advantage they have is in the manufacturing because these chips they're making are so complex. They've done this for so long and invested so much into this with their partners like TSMC. They really have an edge there. What was really interesting from the call is they said that about 40% of their revenue is for the inference revenues. That's like when you do a prompt on generative AI and you get an answer, and that was really encouraging for the future growth in the chip spending for Nvidia. That was a little bit of light they shined on in the quarter."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Etsy and Wayfair reported results. Etsy's results were mixed and shares fell while Wayfair showed improved results and the stock was up 10%. Emily, any similarities here in these reports? What's Wayfair doing that Etsy isn't?"", ""Emily Flippen: This is a great example of don't judge a company by a single quarter, because if you look at these two quarters as you just mentioned, Ron, it makes it seem like, oh, Wayfair's executing right, those costs are coming down and Etsy is struggling. In reality, both of these businesses are struggling a bit, although Etsy has a better track record, I think, of proving out the usefulness of its platform in comparison with someone like Wayfair who has struggled to maintain its strategy, especially in the world post-pandemic. But both of these companies do have a similarity, as you mentioned Ron, which is both of these platforms right now are pretty out of favor. Wayfair is struggling to increase demand even as consumers remain relatively resilient."", 'If you look at just their results, their active customers over the course of the year were flat, but within the quarter as well as throughout the entirety of 2023, their lifetime revenue per active customer and their average order value all declined. The good news for Wayfair in the quarter was just the fact that they were able to cut costs. Any margin expansion is them just trying to narrow the size of their business despite the fact that their top line has been so paltry. Etsy, on the other hand, I think has struggled to maintain growth in the post-pandemic world, in the sense that its growth has continuously grown smaller than the e-commerce sector at large.', ""If you look at this quarter, this is their second full year of negative GMS growth, that's their gross merchandise sales. The second full year of negative growth, which of course is below industry averages. Both these companies, I think, are still going back to the drawing board to say, what can we do to drive consumers to our platform? Because it's not enough to say high interest rates are driving consumers away. Because we see time and time again from other consumer-facing businesses, people are willing to spend, just not here."", 'Ron Gross: Is it fair to say that Etsy is more discretionary spending focused and Wayfair has some non-discretionary and could that be impacting results?', ""Emily Flippen: I think that's fair. I will say I think Etsy has an understanding about where it stands in the consumer cycle more than something like Wayfair does. Wayfair has a ton of competitors. They're a known website, but they don't get as much direct traffic as say, Etsy. They spend more money to acquire those customers. They're competing with the Amazons of the world in a way that Etsy just isn't. They have a distinct brand at Etsy, which I think benefits them a bit more, despite the fact that what people are purchasing are things like gifts or presents, which can be, to your point, more discretionary."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, a 9% increase in its dividend, and plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio to boost its ad business. Andy, a lot to unpack here. Results look good. The acquisition is interesting to me. What's your headline here?"", 'Andy Cross: Hard to find a mass retailer with a better quarter than Walmart. As you mentioned, e-commerce sales were up 23% for the quarter. Walmart U.S. gains in grocery and those e-commerce sales were up 17% in the U.S. Global advertising was up 33%, with EPS, earnings per share, up $1.80, handily beating estimates. Generated $15 billion in free cash flow for the year, up $3 billion. Ron, as you mentioned, boosted that dividend 9%, which was the highest in 10 years. But what was really interesting was this acquisition of Vizio. It had been rumored for a week or so. It was a $2.3 billion acquisition, so not very large for the likes of someone like Walmart.', 'But as CEO Doug McMillon said, ""This acquisition accelerates the build-out of our advertising platform into the connected TV business,"" and Vizio has this SmartCast operating system. It\'s going to connect with the Walmart Connect ad platform. I think it\'s a really interesting, reasonably priced way for Walmart to continue to build out that advertising network. Interesting, you saw a lot of those adtech companies fall off on this news because now all of a sudden you have one of the best operators in the world, really making a deeper push into connected television advertising. Vizio has 500 direct advertising partners and many of them are part of the Fortune 500, so it\'s a really good fit for Walmart.', 'Ron Gross: Fifty-first consecutive year of dividend increases, 25 times forward earnings for Walmart. Do you like the stock?', ""Andy Cross: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. Don't expect the massive growth because they are really looking and pushing aggressively into these, what we all thought were like side businesses, but very much could be core. Also, their international business is doing quite well, too."", ""Ron Gross: On Tuesday, Teladoc reported a fourth-quarter loss that was less than expected, but sales were disappointing and management issued weak forward guidance. Emily, the stock got whacked. Is Teladoc's growth story officially coming to an end here?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think Teladoc's growth story has been coming to an end for a pretty extensive period of time. I know a lot of people will point to the pandemic as an indicator that this telemedicine provider was always going to be something that people only used when they were stuck at home, and that of course, people go back to their doctors' offices whenever the pandemic has let up. Certainly, there has been some of that, but I think that oversimplifies the story of Teladoc, which is to say that the thesis behind this business was that they were going to spend immediately of a lot of money up front to acquire and roll up all of these smaller telemedicine providers until they were the dominant force."", ""They have a fair amount of relationships with healthcare plans, but that roll-up strategy ended up being incredibly expensive at a time when the businesses that they were acquiring were just trading at insane valuations, which made it really challenging for Teladoc to actually gain market share, as well as drive profitability. We're still seeing the outfall of that today. That was what we saw in this most recent quarter, which was sales growth was pretty paltry, only around 4%. Indicators for that slowdown, especially in margin expansion, to continue. But they are still looking to improve their business. Now, I will say this, that margin expansion they're aiming for, they're saying 5,200 basis points of margin expansion for adjusted EBITDA over the next three years, each year. It's always good to be like, hey, look, we're driving profitability, but gosh, 5,200 basis points with this company is not enough. In this past quarter, they had 260 basis points of expansion. That just shows you how much that slowdown is happening in terms of their margin."", ""Ron Gross: Coming up, we'll talk cybersecurity and an acquisition in the banking sector. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here in studio with Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. On Tuesday, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks reported results that were not met with enthusiasm. It wasn't necessarily the quarterly results, but more so a change to its strategy that's spooked investors. Emily, results didn't seem to warrant a 25% drop in the stock. What's the problem with the new strategy that has investors running for the door?"", ""Emily Flippen: Just looking at the quarter as you mentioned, things look great, that's 16% billings growth. Whatever strategy Palo Alto has been implementing to this point, has worked for the stock, it's worked for investors. So when the management came out and said, hey, we had 16% of billings growth this quarter, but we think that's going to be 2%-3% next quarter. Investors shot first and asked questions later, which is understandable. In addition with Palo Alto falling, a lot of other cybersecurity companies start falling as well. Which begs the question of, is this a slowdown in demand for cybersecurity in general, or is this a Palo Alto-specific issue? The answer, in my opinion, is very much the latter."", ""Palo Alto is implementing a change in their kind of, I wouldn't call strategy, I'd say tactics of way of acquiring customers, which is to say when companies are in the process of shifting their security to the cloud, they're oftentimes working with numerous different vendors, all of which Palo Alto seeks to replace. It can make that transition challenging for them. Palo Alto historically, alongside other companies, has been transitioning and charging full up front despite the fact that that company may be working with different vendors. Under their new strategy, what they're effectively doing is providing their services for free until those existing vendor contracts end later on. This could be a period of effectively years. But management thinks that this is going to accelerate their long-term revenue growth even though it shows a slowdown in the short term and that this could theoretically be a more offensive strategy to gain market share in an industry that is becoming increasingly competitive."", 'Ron Gross: Price wars maybe in the future here as a result of this move.', ""Emily Flippen: That's what a lot of people are saying, but I think it still remains TBD whether or not companies like CrowdStrike, for instance, are really going to feel the need to provide their platform for free when they've managed to convert so many enterprise spenders with full payments right up front."", ""Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Capital One announced that it would acquire Discover Financial in an all-stock transaction worth $32.3 billion. This deal would combine two of the largest credit card companies in the U.S. Andy, what's got Capital One interested in Discover? Do you like the deal?"", ""Andy Cross: Yeah, it's really about the network. So buying that Discover network, it's one of the major ones with Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Granted, it's much smaller than those, based on data from our sister company, The Ascent, reports that Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have about 96% market share of payment volume with Discovery at 4%. So it's much smaller but it's unique. Capital One now is going out to spend an all-stock deal valued about $35 billion to acquire this network and that network that they'll be able to bring into their family and start to move some of their Mastercard and Visa credit cards over to Discover family."", ""When you start thinking about what Richard Fairbank, the co-founder and CEO of Capital One, calls the Holy Grail, to be both an issuer and a network provider. That's real magic because it starts to connect them with those merchants that Discover has that Capital One just didn't have access to. It is not a sure thing. The stock's at about $120-ish and the deal point would be at about $140. There's some concern that regulatory issues are going to keep this deal from happening. But overall, if you're a Cap One shareholder, I think that's a good deal for you to buy this. It could dilute a little bit of the book value, but overall, I think the long-term picture for Cap One with Discover is pretty bright."", 'Ron Gross: Banking sector always controversial, especially within the Senate. It is an election year. Do you think we will have some senators here, some government officials here clamoring for this deal not to get done?', ""Andy Cross: We're already seeing it. Senator Warren's come out pretty aggressively saying don't do the deal. They do expect it to close late 2024, or early 2025. I can't see a closing this year. If it gets through it will probably be early next year. But I do think it'll get very high scrutiny and that's one reason why the stock is not really that close to the acquisition price."", 'Ron Gross: Would you recommend an arbitrage here?', ""Andy Cross: I would not arbitrage the stock. I think if you're a Discover shareholder, hold onto your shares."", 'Ron Gross: Sounds good. On Thursday, MercadoLibre reported solid sales results, but earnings were hurt by what appears to be two non-recurring tax charges. Emily, first, are the charges really non-recurring? Second, how do results look if we adjust for them?', ""Emily Flippen: To answer your question with a non-answer, yes and no. It is not recurring in the sense that the business in this most recent quarter is recognizing a lot of expenses associated with the change in tax status right up front, when less than 1% of that is actually attributable to their actions over the last quarter. You can understand why they backed that out. But yes, it can be recurring in the sense that management did say that moving forward under these new tax rules, they're going to have around $20 million a quarter in incremental charges."", ""In addition to that, they have this lawsuit that they are expecting that they're now going to lose it. It seems to be non-material for the business moving forward, stemming from some rather old liability associated with its business over the past decade. But all those expenses being recognized in the quarter did bring that non-adjusted number down. But even if you just back out those numbers, results still came in a bit less than what the market expected."", ""The good news is sales were strong, so the stock is not down massively. The thesis for MercadoLibre hasn't been broken, but they did fail to keep up with the pace of inflation in Argentina, which resulted in the margin of sales coming from that country to be a little bit lower. I think investors should continue to really watch the fintech business here, though. This is the driving force, what I believe to be the driving force behind MercadoLibre's profitability, which is their expansion of credit offerings, debit cards, bank accounts. All of which continue to explode."", ""Andy Cross: When you think about that fintech business that Emily just talked about, the performance of non-performing loans due 90 days or longer fell from almost 30% to 18.7% this quarter over the past year. That's a good sign. They're seeing less and less on the non-performing side. But they have increased the provision to those doubtful accounts to the highest of the year. I think there is maybe perhaps some investor concern that it is going to be a little bit more challenging environment for them. But the fintech side, aside for Mercado Libre, what I think it's just continues to be interesting is the logistics business."", ""They shipped 407 million items. That was up 31%, next-day items shipped was up 21% year over year. Now almost 50% of all the products they ship go across the MercadoLibre logistics business. Again, they just continue to build out that ecosystem. They've a little budding streaming business. I just really liked the way they are positioning themselves, but there are all these macro factors that investors have to watch and we certainly watch them over in Stock Advisor."", ""Ron Gross: On Friday, stock was down about 10%. I'm still not really seeing the reason for it. Do you think that potentially could be overblown?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think there's an expectation now with those impending tax charges that their margin's going to be just mildly lower than what analysts expect. That combined with the failure in expansion of profitability and inflation, Argentina, probably just lowered expectations."", ""Ron Gross: All right, Fools, we'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, a conversation with Bloomberg reporter Kurt Wagner about Twitter and his book, The Battle for the Bird. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Kurt Wagner, a Bloomberg reporter covering social media companies and author of the new book, The Battle for the Bird. They discussed Twitter's early days, lessons from Musk's takeover, and what makes the old Twitter so hard to replicate."", ""Deidre Woollard: I love this book. I love the idea of the history of Twitter, and you go back before everything really started getting crazy. I want to take the listeners back because I want to start with a couple of alternate universe questions because you talk about 2015. Twitter's casting around for a new CEO before bringing back Jack Dorsey, and they look at Andy Jassy, who now of course is Amazon CEO, but was running AWS at that point. Probably a better move for him. But what might Twitter be like with someone a little more organized at the helm?"", 'Kurt Wagner: Maybe more traditional.', 'Deidre Woollard: Traditional is a good word.', ""Kurt Wagner: Traditional business mind. Well, certainly, a more lucrative decision for Andy Jassy to stay working at Amazon. But the reason the board came to this conclusion as they thought at the time that Twitter's biggest issue was the product. They really thought if they could figure out how to grow the product, how to create maybe some killer features that the business would follow and so as a result, Jack Dorsey felt like the product choice here, Andy Jassy felt more like the business choice."", ""He was someone who obviously had a ton of success, but in enterprise software, not necessarily consumer products, and so they ultimately went with Jack Dorsey. It's a fun thought experiment to think like what would Twitter have looked like? Actually, a lot of people don't realize there's a decent chunk of Twitter's business that was related to the API into data-sharing and things like that, and maybe that would have become a much larger thing under someone like Andy Jassy, just given his background, but we'll never really know. They thought that Jack was the product guy that they needed and that's obviously in the direction that they went."", 'Deidre Woollard: Another alternative universe question I have for you is about when Disney and Salesforce were hovering around thinking about buying Twitter. Disney got pretty close, which I found surprising. I know that they, at one point, were thinking of almost buying BuzzFeed. What do you think Twitter would have been like if the deal went through with Disney, would it still exist?', ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I think it would have because the way that Disney was thinking about Twitter at that time was as a streaming service. A lot of people might not remember. But in 2016 when these conversations were happening, Twitter was really pushing into live video. They wanted to be like a TV on the internet. They were streaming Thursday Night Football games. They were making deals with all kinds of other content partners and that was what attracted Disney, was this idea that maybe they could take their catalog of high-quality content and get it to people through Twitter. You look at what Disney+ is right now, for example. It's possible that, that could have been like a role that Twitter played had this acquisition happened or in some way, maybe Twitter would have shifted and looked very different than it does today. But I do think it would have existed because the thing that Disney wanted it for is something that the company is still very much doing."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I find this fascinating with video because Twitter, they got it early on, they got it ahead of everybody, and they struggled with it. You've got the shutdown of Vine and Periscope. You've got these repeated mis-swings. You just talked about the Thursday Night Football. They keep building it, but then they keep not really being successful with it. What made this so hard to master for them?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, the execution was obviously poor. I think when you think about what the Vine, for those who might not remember Vine was this short, six-second looping video. The people who used it were very creative. There was a whole community and culture that had been built around Vine, and it was very reminiscent, or sorry, very similar, I should say, to what we now see with TikTok. Twitter at the time had TikTok in the building, but they didn't nail it, and the biggest I think issue that I gathered was around this time, they were doing three different video offerings at once. All three were led by different people."", ""All three were competing for resources internally, there was no real cohesive effort. They had Periscope, which was live video. They had this professional produced live stuff, the TV stuff we talked about with the NFL, and then they had Vine and there was just no cohesion between those three. They were competitive. This, in my opinion, is one of the biggest mistakes that Jack Dorsey made when he came back was not figuring out a way to bring this strategy together. As a result, even though they were early to a lot of these things, they didn't execute on them well enough to ultimately establish themselves, I guess, as the premier place for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: I feel like they didn't give it enough time, either, especially with Vine because what you just talked about, I mean, you had proto-influencers. You had people that were doing stunts and things like that. It was pretty sticky and Periscope was less so, but Vine was interesting."", ""Kurt Wagner: Well, and one of the big things I think with Vine is, I don't think they ever did enough to convince creators that that was worth their time. Imagine you're a young internet creator. You're creating these fun videos, you built an audience on Vine. Well, at a certain point, you're looking to make money. Twitter and Vine were not offering them the ways to make money that YouTube was, that Instagram would eventually go on to do. If you're someone who that is your livelihood, you're going to go to the place where you can make some money and so I think they were just too slow to recognize that, hey, we have this great community. We need to figure out how they can stay self-sustainable, and they just didn't pivot quick enough to do that for them."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, before Elon enters the room, we've got Elliott Investment Management. They pop up in the book. I've seen a lot of Elliott in the news lately. They've been looking at Crown Castle, which is a tower REIT I follow. They've been looking at Match, Phillips 66.\xa0What did you learn about Elliott's style by researching what they were doing with Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: It's a pretty simple style, which is what can we do to make the most money? They don't really worry a ton about the collateral damage. In Twitter's case it was, OK, we have this service that's incredibly popular, but we have a guy who's running it who has another full-time job like this just does not equate. Like the thought was, Twitter would simply be worth more money and would be more valuable if the person running it did it as a full-time job."", ""It's a hard thing to argue. Most companies of that size should have a full-time CEO, and so they came in with that mindset like, hey, it's nothing personal. Jack, we don't dislike you as a person But the fact that you're running two jobs, it hurts the value of this company and we need to figure that out. I really liked this chapter and I really liked to digging in on this because it was a really fascinating business clash to watch this activist investor try and boot the CEO from the company while the board of directors is actively fighting to keep him. Ultimately, I would say the board won in the short term, Jack got to keep his job."", 'They had to make a bunch of I guess, concessions to Elliott in order for that to happen. But in the long term, I think Elliott actually got what they wanted, which was they got a much more focused company. They got some very specific goals around the business, around user growth, around revenue, things like that, that Twitter had never had to do before. Ultimately, Jack Dorsey left the company about 18 months later, and I think a big reason was that this had burnt him out and this had really bothered him. Even though he got to keep his job short-term, I think Elliot got what they wanted in the long term, which was that full-time CEO for Twitter.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned that it was nothing personal, but he took it personally and I think that's something that he has in common with Elon Musk, is this idea of taking business things really personally. So the relationship between them is interesting and we knew that Musk loves Twitter, but the relationship between Musk and Dorsey I found really interesting in the book because it gives us a good flavor that there's a mutual admiration society there. But then it seems like there's been less of that over time. So I think I see some of the ways that they're similar but tell me a little bit about where they're similar and where they differ."", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll start with the differences because I think they're more striking. I think the way that these two choose to manage and lead is very different. Jack was very thoughtful, almost to a fault. He was generally slow. He was hands-off. He didn't like to make a ton of decisions. He'd like to empower the people who reported him to do that. He served as an advisor, if you will. Then Elon is the exact opposite. He runs a million miles per hour. He makes all the decisions himself. He doesn't necessarily care too much about the feelings of his employees. He's just working toward his ultimate mission and if you get in the way, you either run with him or you get run over. So I think from a management standpoint, they were incredibly different."", ""Where I think they were similar is that I think jack had this idealistic vision for Twitter about what it could be or maybe should be, if it wasn't a publicly traded company and I think Elon bought into that or agreed with that. I think where they met was like, OK, we manage things differently. We treat people differently, but our vision for what Twitter could be or should be is the same and that's where they shook hands and seemed to be on the same page. Now, obviously, I don't think that's materialized in the way that certainly Jack Dorsey had envisioned but I think there's also something to be said about being rich and being a founder. It's a small crew, it's a small social circle of billionaire tech founders. So I think sometimes people who are in that circles gravitate toward one another simply because there's very few people in the world who can relate to what they go through, what their life is like, and I'm sure that there was some of that as well."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about when he comes in. He comes into this company, he brings a sink in the building, it's all nuts. It's like a how-not-to, because there's layoffs, there's chaos, there's a climate of fear, there's just bad communication, there's threats. Is there any positive lessons that we can learn from the general disaster that happens when he decides to take over?"", ""Kurt Wagner: I'll maybe give him two, I don't even know if they're compliments, but I'll maybe say there's two things that maybe were on the right track at least to start. The one is like when you take over a company like this, being very dramatic in terms of your changes, I actually think is an OK thing to do. Twitter was in a rut. It had spent a long summer as we've talked about with the lawsuit and all these things and I think the idea of coming in and really trying to be radically different is actually OK. I don't think he executed on this idea very well, but I think in theory, being radically different wasn't necessarily a bad idea. The other thing that I think he did or at least the intentions were there to do, was he moves very fast."", ""Twitter had a history of moving very slowly, of second-guessing themselves, of taking forever to launch things and this idea that Elon had came in and wanted to move quickly and was willing to literally sleep at the office to get things done, set it set that example for people. I don't think that's healthy work-life balance by any stretch, but I do think there's something to be said about his willingness to move fast in the tech world can be somewhat commendable sometimes. Now, again, I don't think he executed either these things very well. I think he didn't really have a set plan when he came in and then the moving too quickly actually got them into more trouble because there was no plan that he was following. But I think on paper, those two things could have been positives had they been handled a little bit differently."", ""Deidre Woollard: The new X, it's a different place. I've been on there, I think I joined Twitter in like 2008. I tried to move on, I'm trying -- I've tried Threads, Jack Dorsey's got Bluesky. Nothing has quite measured up so far. So is Twitter like a time-and-place phenomenon, do you think? Or is there room for the next big short message social media service? If so, do you see anything? What are you using? Are you still on Twitter?"", ""Kurt Wagner: Yeah, I am still on Twitter. Now X, of course. I like to think that I'm mostly there because I cover the company, but to be honest, I still do get some real value out of it. I'm a big sports fan and like the sports news and sports community on Twitter, I think is one of the things that has actually been able to stay somewhat strong. But I've been thinking a lot about this, like can Twitter be replicated? I'm not so sure that it can, for a couple of reasons. No. 1, the thing that made Twitter so unique and great was that pretty much everyone felt that they needed to be on it in terms of celebrity. So if you're a politician, if you're a musician, if you're a journalist, if you're a celebrity of some kind, there was this feeling that you had to be on Twitter because that's where people talked about things in public. I'm not sure you could convince that collection of people that they need to be anywhere in 2024 or beyond."", ""I think we've gotten to this point in social media where people, 10-15 years ago thought it was a necessity. Now people have realized, well, there are pros and cons of social media, but it's not something I have to do. So that's what to me made Twitter so unique was like the collection of people who you could hear from, quite frankly, on a regular basis. I just don't think you could convince all those people to come back and then as a result, you're never going to have that community in one place again.

Beginning Feb. 26, KFC is introducing for the very first time in the U.S., its international smash hit Chizza. Featuring two 100% white meat, extra crispy fillets topped with marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni. So Fools, what do you think? Would you try it? Will it be a hit in the U.S.? Emily, you are up."", 'Emily Flippen: Did you just asked me if I\'ve ever had Parmesan chicken? [laughs] That\'s what this is.

We've got a couple of stocks on our radar and I'll bring in our man, Dan Boyd, to ask a question and pick his favorite. Emily, you are up first. What do you got?"", ""Emily Flippen: The stock on my radar this week is Grab. The ticker is G-R-A-B. For investors who are unfamiliar, Grab is based out of Southeast Asia. It operates a little bit like Uber Eats or Grubhub, where they have mobility, they have transportation, delivery, logistics. A one-stop shop of sorts. They came out and they posted their first ever quarterly profit this quarter, fourth quarter 2023. They also approved a $500 million share repurchase plan, which is really interesting. The company doesn't have absurd stock-based compensation, but it does have a ton of cash on its balance sheet. So what they're saying is effectively, well, in the meantime, while we figure out what to do with this cash, why not reward some shareholders through share repurchases? What I'm continuing to watch, though, is just how they manage their incentive payments to drive expansion in both active customers and the number of orders. They've had a 12% increase in transacting users over the last quarter, which is great. But I want to see those incentive payments continue to come down."", 'Andy Cross: Dan, you got a question about Grab?', ""Dan Boyd: So I'd never heard of this stock before Emily brought it to the show. I was looking it up and I still don't really understand what they do. Emily, could you give us a quick primer?"", 'Emily Flippen: Have you have you gotten an Uber before? Have you ordered Grubhub or Uber Eats? Have you sent a package to somebody you love? There you go. You got Grab.', ""Ron Gross: I'm still not sure what they do. Andy, you're up. What are you looking at?"", ""Andy Cross: Team, I'm looking at HubSpot, H-U-B-S, a subscription CRM tool, customer relationship management to more than 205,000 customers who rely on that tool, especially small, medium-sized businesses, $30 billion company, $600 stock price. The stock's up 55% in the past year. It's growing about 25% and sells for about 14 times multiple on those sales. What's really interesting is they have recently announced a new pricing scheme. So they provide these hubs that around operations, content management, customer service for these clients, sales of the big usage of them. They are now doing a new pricing plan that removes some of the seat limitations.\xa0It's easier to upgrade, aligns the pricing with some of the new CRM tools and some of the new AI stuff there they're inputting for. So that's going to hit in March, so I'm really watching to see how that impacts both their subscriber base as well as some of their revenue numbers."", 'Ron Gross: Dan?', ""Dan Boyd: So this company, they don't make hubcaps?"", 'Andy Cross: They do not make hubcaps. But I believe they probably help a company that does make hubcaps.', ""Ron Gross: Dan, we've got Grab Holdings and HubSpot, neither of which you understand, what are you putting on your watch list?"", ""Dan Boyd: This is a tough one, Ron. I'm going to go with Grab just because, I don't know, Emily's made more sense with her explanation."", ""Ron Gross: All right. Emily Flippen, Andy Cross, thanks for being here.

With healthcare making up nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy, it's a great place to look."", ""Three Motley Fool contributors have identified what they think are magnificent growth stocks to buy in March -- and all of them are in the healthcare sector. Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", 'David Jagielski (Eli Lilly): One stock that could potentially usurp one of the tech stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven"" is Eli Lilly. The company\'s prospects are truly magnificent, thanks to a couple of promising glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs in Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (weight loss).', 'The potential is massive, with analysts repeatedly upgrading their forecasts for weight loss drugs given their potential to treat other diseases and conditions. Analysts at Morgan Stanley already have an extremely optimistic outlook for the anti-obesity drug market, projecting that it could grow by a multiple of 16, reaching a value of more than $100 billion by 2030.', 'A recent trial found that tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, can potentially be an effective treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, a form of liver disease. Another study, involving Wegovy, a rival weight loss drug from Novo Nordisk, showed that this GLP-1 drug could help reduce cardiovascular risk for obese individuals with heart disease.', ""While Eli Lilly's drugs haven't yet been approved for that indication (and neither has Wegovy), it's a positive sign of the sheer potential growth they could generate for the business."", 'Some analysts believe tirzepatide could produce $100 billion in revenue for Eli Lilly and be the best-selling drug ever. Although the stock might look expensive right now, trading at more than 130 times its trailing earnings, it still might not be too late to invest given that Zepbound and Mounjaro are still in the early stages of their growth.', ""Keith Speights (Moderna): Don't think of Moderna as just a COVID vaccine stock. Sure, that's been true in recent years, but it's likely to change soon."", 'The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of May 12, 2024, for its decision on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine mRNA-1345. Moderna could have a big winner on its hands if the vaccine is approved as anticipated.', 'While there are a couple of other new RSV vaccines on the market, only mRNA-1345 has a pre-filled syringe that offers convenient administration.', 'I think that this vaccine will provide a big boost to Moderna, and the company does, too. It projects that the business will return to sales growth in 2025 thanks in large part to its new RSV vaccine.', ""That's not the only good news that could be on the way. Moderna plans to file for approval of its mRNA-1010 seasonal flu vaccine this year. It expects results from two other key late-stage clinical programs in 2024 as well."", ""One is mRNA-1083, the company's combination COVID-flu vaccine candidate. The other is experimental cytomegalovirus vaccine mRNA-1647."", ""In the meantime, Moderna's Spikevax coronavirus vaccine should continue to rake in a lot of money. Granted, sales have declined sharply due to sinking demand, but management still projects that Spikevax will generate sales of around $4 billion this year."", ""I'm also quite optimistic about the company's individualized neoantigen therapy mRNA-4157. Moderna and Merck are evaluating the experimental vaccine in combination with blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda in treating several types of cancer. Phase 2b study results showed that this combo reduced the risk of recurrence or death in melanoma patients by 49%."", ""Moderna's stock has plunged since mid-2021. My prediction, though, is that the company's oncoming wave of new products will spark a big comeback."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): If you're looking for a fantastic growth stock to buy in March -- or in any other month -- you can't go wrong with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Though there are plenty of growth companies on the market, few benefit from a monopoly like this biotech does. It is the only company in the world that markets therapies to treat the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis (CF)."", ""This isn't a situation where Vertex holds 90% of the market, and several smaller competitors are fighting for the scraps. There is only one game in town here, and its name is Vertex Pharmaceuticals."", ""The company's innovative wheel is still spinning. It recently reported positive results for its next-gen CF medicine. The drugmaker is also expanding its lineup. It is currently launching a gene-editing therapy called Casgevy that targets a pair of blood-related disorders."", ""Management is looking to target the market for pain medicines. Yes, there are plenty of options here, but many come with significant side effects, especially opioid-based ones. Vertex's VX-548, which recently posted good phase 3 data, is on the trail here. The biotech has a pipeline full of other candidates, most of which are targeting areas with severe unmet needs."", ""That's how it achieved exceptional success in the CF market -- Don't put it past the company to do it again. So, even though Vertex Pharmaceuticals has crushed the market in the past decade, it is still time to get in on this magnificent growth stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

As a reminder, we recently announced the nomination of eight highly qualified, independent candidates (the ""Investor Slate"") for election to the Company’s Board of Directors (the ""Board"") at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, we announced a proposed management team that includes transportation network leader Jim Barber, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and lifelong railroad operator and turnaround expert Jamie Boychuk as Chief Operating Officer. To learn more, visit www.MoveNSCForward.com.', '""We hope the crew and everyone in Lower Saucon Township are unharmed by yet another derailment of a Norfolk Southern train. Although our fiduciary obligation is to pursue optimal returns for the pensions, family offices and other clients who entrust us with their capital, nothing takes precedence over the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our proposed slate and management team are unanimous in their view that Norfolk Southern must become a safer and more reliable railroad before it can ever reach its full potential. Following this latest derailment, we call for the immediate termination of CEO Alan Shaw and stand ready to engage with the Company about an orderly reconstitution of the Board and a transition to capable management with a track record of actually delivering on safety commitments.', 'It is all too common for people to see in the news that a Norfolk Southern train is at the center of a derailment or tragedy.1 It is only by the grace of God that preliminary reports indicate no fatalities are associated with this accident. Images of diesel-filled locomotives lying on their sides underscore the urgent need to replace the Company’s failed executive leadership and provide this railroad the fresh start it so desperately needs.', 'This latest incident, which follows other accidents and the tragic death of an engineer this year, has resulted in two locomotives tumbling down a riverbank just 50 miles outside of Philadelphia and 85 miles outside of New York City. A derailment of this nature could cause fuel to leak into the river and nearby soil, resulting in health risks for communities who drink from this water and inviting investigations from state and federal governments. American Rivers, a non-profit, states that the Lehigh River supports the drinking water supply of 15 million people.2 A derailment like this could also hurt near-term service quality on an extremely busy line that connects major cities. This latest chapter in a series of accidents, which have been downplayed by Norfolk Southern, leads us to believe that it is only a matter of time before Mr. Shaw’s approach results in another wholesale disaster like the one in East Palestine, Ohio.', 'This comes days after the Board arrogantly promoted management’s safety record and revealed a 37% year-over-year raise in total compensation for Mr. Shaw, resulting in pay of roughly $13.4 million. It also follows the Board’s sustained efforts to poison the well and peddle misinformation about our safety commitments to regulators, shippers, labor and the media. An incident like this, which is drawing national news coverage and resulting in more embarrassment for the railroad, should put an end to the Board’s unsustainable efforts to save a tainted CEO with no long-term future.3 How can anyone defend this?""', 'About Ancora', 'Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""The Chairman & CEO, James Robert Quincey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$15m worth of shares at a price of US$60.94 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$59.53. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern."", ""Insiders in Coca-Cola didn't buy any shares in the last year.

Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all."", ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$1.7b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

To put the Oracle of Omaha's track record in perspective, if you bought $1,000 worth of Berkshire shares when Buffett purchased a controlling stake in the business and became its CEO in May 1965, you would today own stock worth roughly $34.3 million."", ""Of course, Berkshire's current massive size makes it unlikely that its stock will deliver a performance like that again any time this century. With a market capitalization of $889 billion, it ranks as the world's eighth-most-valuable company. Delivering exponential growth becomes far more difficult at that level."", ""But taking some pages out of Buffett's investing playbook can still be a great way to score market-beating returns, and two Motley Fool contributors think following the Oracle of Omaha's lead on these two stocks below would be a great way to strengthen your portfolio."", ""Keith Noonan: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest online retail company. It's also the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services."", ""Though it accounts for the large majority of the company's revenues, Amazon's e-commerce business actually does not account for most of its profits. Because of its high operating costs, the online retail unit generates relatively low profit margins. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business is far more profitable, bringing in roughly 67% of the company's $36.9 billion in operating income last year."", 'But as Amazon continues to leverage economies of scale and takes advantage of new technologies, it should be able to achieve far better margins from its e-commerce business. Notably, wider use of artificial intelligence (AI) should provide an incredible performance catalyst for the already hugely successful company.', ""AI will likely pave the way for increased automation at the company's warehouses. It could also open the door for self-driving vehicles and autonomous-delivery technologies. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce operating costs could fall dramatically -- and its profits could skyrocket."", ""Meanwhile, the growing demand for AI is already powering strong performance for AWS. AI applications are being built, launched, and scaled on the company's cloud infrastructure. As more applications are created and used, demand for that cloud infrastructure will continue to rise."", 'For long-term investors seeking AI growth stocks that offer an attractive risk-reward profile, Amazon has the makings of a great buy right now.', ""Parkev Tatevosian: To me, in order for a stock to be a no-brainer investment, I must feel confident that the company will be around for at least another two decades. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) certainly fits that bill. The beverage giant has been delighting customers for roughly a century, and it's reasonable to assume it will be around for several decades more, at least. Importantly, Coca-Cola serves customers in a way that generates lucrative profits for shareholders."", ""In 2023, its revenue totaled $45.7 billion while its operating income totaled $13 billion. This means that after covering all the expenses involved in serving customers those tasty beverages they have come to love, Coca-Cola's operating profit margin was a refreshing 28.4%."", ""The proven capability to generate billions in sales at lucrative profit margins can go a long way toward relieving investors' concerns about the risks of investing. Certainly, billions in annual profits attracted Buffett to Coca-Cola stock. The underlying reasons that those profits keep flowing are management's skill in operating the business effectively, combined with consumers' brand loyalty and their steady consumption habits."", ""I am usually willing to pay a higher price to invest in companies like Coca-Cola because of the high chance they will be around for the long term. Fortunately, Coca-Cola's valuation is not too expensive. Currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20, Coca-Cola's stock has lately been at the lower end of the range it has occupied for the last several years. Investors who buy Coca-Cola stock today reasonably expect their investment to be worth more 20 or 30 years from now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024. ', 'The stock market of 2024 is driven by the same trends that saw investors glued to their screens in 2023. The primary themes in the market right now are artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, with the final week of February providing investors with key data points and news on both fronts.', ""Before we get to the news, it's important to see how large cap stocks are fairing these days. These stocks are typically sizeable, mature, and established companies that command strong market positions along with comforting balance sheets. Like other stocks, their performance is also tied to the stock market, and large cap stocks typically attract investors during economic downturns or shaky conditions as they offer comfort with their ability to hedge against major losses."", 'Diving deeper into large cap stocks, these can be divided either along their industries or their fundamentals to further fine tune any performance expectations. Large cap stocks in stable sectors such as consumer defensive, the likes of the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) or the consumer goods behemoth Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are sizeable entities whose global brand following enables investors to rest in comfort knowing that even if the stock and revenue are down in a recession, both will pick up ones the economic winds become more favorable.', 'On the flip side, large cap stocks belonging to high risk sectors such as biotechnology are significantly vulnerable to market whims as well as any whiff that investors might get about potential troubles. For instance, consider the large cap biotechnology stocks Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). These two stocks are household names due to their coronavirus vaccine, but despite being multi billion dollar firms, the shares have painted quite an eye watering performance if we consider their performance over the course of the past couple of years.', ""In fact, the risky nature of these large cap stock industries means that investors have to be on constant watch out for any headwinds that could affect business performance. For Moderna, this came in the form of a report in February 2024 that its vaccine for a respiratory virus had demonstrated reduced efficacy. The shares tumbled 7% on that day, and overall, the stock is down 22% year to date, proving that just because a stock is a large cap does not mean that it will always remain stable. Similarly, BioNTech's stock is down by nearly 15% during its latest earnings report that saw the firm stress that it would return to growth in 2025 after it scales up oncology products to mitigate the effects of a bottoming out of its COVID vaccine market."", ""So, with some drivers of large cap stock performance out of the way, let's focus on the news before a brief primer on value stocks.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) beat analyst second quarter revenue and profit estimates as it shared that growth in its semiconductor design products and solutions for AI chips should help with a great second quarter. Focusing on the Fed, the central bank's January meeting minutes show that participants continued to be worried about cutting interest rates too soon. This is natural since recent producer inflation prints remain stubbornly high, and for large cap value stocks, this might be good news."", 'This is because, in tight economic conditions, growth stocks, such as those characterized by high price to earnings (P/E) ratios typically fall. On the flip side, value stocks tend to hold their ground as investors have set their market share price reasonably in comparison to fundamentals such as EPS.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top large cap value stocks to buy.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$923.7m', 'US$1.62b', 'US$2.28b', 'US$2.79b', 'US$3.25b', 'US$3.65b', 'US$3.99b', 'US$4.27b', 'US$4.52b', 'US$4.73b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x6', 'Est @ 22.55%', 'Est @ 16.47%', 'Est @ 12.22%', 'Est @ 9.24%', 'Est @ 7.16%', 'Est @ 5.70%', 'Est @ 4.67%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% ', 'US$858', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

The primary themes in the market right now are artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, with the final week of February providing investors with key data points and news on both fronts.', ""Before we get to the news, it's important to see how large cap stocks are fairing these days. These stocks are typically sizeable, mature, and established companies that command strong market positions along with comforting balance sheets. Like other stocks, their performance is also tied to the stock market, and large cap stocks typically attract investors during economic downturns or shaky conditions as they offer comfort with their ability to hedge against major losses."", 'Diving deeper into large cap stocks, these can be divided either along their industries or their fundamentals to further fine tune any performance expectations. Large cap stocks in stable sectors such as consumer defensive, the likes of the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc.

For instance, consider the large cap biotechnology stocks Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). These two stocks are household names due to their coronavirus vaccine, but despite being multi billion dollar firms, the shares have painted quite an eye watering performance if we consider their performance over the course of the past couple of years.', ""In fact, the risky nature of these large cap stock industries means that investors have to be on constant watch out for any headwinds that could affect business performance. For Moderna, this came in the form of a report in February 2024 that its vaccine for a respiratory virus had demonstrated reduced efficacy.
