Specifically, Fitch Ratings warned that it may be forced to downgrade dozens of members of the U.S. banking sector, following its slashed assessment of the industry's health in June. Today's pullback put SCHW back below the $64 level, which has served as a floor since mid-July; however, a historically bullish trendline is flashing on the charts that could help the equity regain some of its lost ground in the coming month.According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's latest study, Charles Schwab stock is within one standard deviation of its 40-day moving average. The equity has seen seven similar signals in the last three years, and was higher one month later 63% of the time, averaging a 5.8% gain. A move of similar magnitude would place SCHW near levels not seen since April. SCHW Chart August 152023An unwinding of options traders' pessimism could add some much-needed tailwinds. This is per Charles Schwab stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) that sits in the 86th percentile of readings from the past 12 months.Those looking to get ahead of the curve should consider speculating with options. This is per SCHW's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 28% that ranks higher than just 5% of annual readings, indicating that volatility expectations are low right now -- a boon for premium buyers.]"

The proposals range from the acquisition of certain production assets to consideration for the whole company.One such proposal to acquire the company was from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. CLF, which the U.S. Steel's board has rejected. The board cited several reasons for its decision, including Cleveland-Cliffs’ refusal to sign an non disclosure agreement, which would have allowed U.S. Steel to have further clarity on key issues, such as the valuation of the stock component of the proposal and the regulatory risk. Also, Cleveland-Cliffs is demanding that U.S. Steel agrees to the economic terms of the proposal in advance, which is not something that U.S. Steel's board can do without conducting a due diligence process.The board of U.S. Steel believes that Cleveland-Cliffs' proposal is unreasonable and it cannot ascertain whether CLF’s proposal properly reflects the full and fair value of the company.The board is committed to acting in the best interests of the company, its stockholders and its stakeholders. The board is taking actions to gather comprehensive information to assess these proposals effectively, especially those that are in the preliminary stages and subject to ongoing due diligence.U.S. Steel, which is among the prominent players in the steel space along with Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics, Inc STLD has strategically invested in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace steelmaking and finishing capabilities, alongside a focus on reducing its carbon footprint.

AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF.Industry: Insurance - Accident &amp; HealthLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2136237/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-accident-health-insurance-industryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Inc., Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers' compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees' pay.Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers' compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees' morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.Story continuesWith commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers' compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers' compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry's performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it in the top 15% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

13,a60e6927-424e-3d53-8978-a855d0b078af,USB,2023-08-16,Fitch warns it may be forced to downgrade banks: Report,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fitch-warns-may-forced-downgrade-152726299.html,1692113246,VIDEO,"['C', 'JPM', 'WFC', 'BAC', 'USB', 'USB-PR']","[Fitch is warning it may cut the ratings on dozens of banks, according to CNBC. Fitch cut its assessment on banks in June, but it was largely missed. If it were to be cut again, that would force Fitch to reevaluate its ratings on all the banks it covers. In the video above, American Banker Washington Bureau Chief and ""Bankshot"" Host John Heltman explains how Fitch's downgrade of the United States' credit rating combined with higher interest rates is putting pressure on banks. Overall, Heltman says ""it makes an already tense lending environment just a little bit more tense and makes the margins a little bit more thin.""Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Credit rating agency Fitch warning it could slash ratings for dozens of lenders. Saying those comments in an interview with CNBC marking the latest sign of turmoil for the industry, Fitch initially cut its overall assessment of the banking industry back in June and cautioned another downgrade could trigger a re-evaluation of more than 70 US banks under its purview, including major lenders like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.Fitch's warning comes just one week after Moody's downgraded 10 small and mid-sized banks. Joining us now is John Heltman-- American Banker Washington Bureau Chief. John, I've been trying to put this in context this morning, right? Because Fitch did the same thing that Moody's did in saying these banks were on watch for possible downgrade. Nobody sort of noticed at the time, just like nobody sort of noticed when Moody's did it a few months ago. You guys at American Banker probably noticed, but the broader market didn't notice.JOHN HELTMAN: To be fair, there was a lot going on a couple--- Yes. Exactly. So how seriously should we take this warning? Is it going to happen? What effect is it going to have?JOHN HELTMAN: Well, I'll just start here. Credit downgrades are bad. They're not good. So that is something definitely worth paying attention to. You know, I think that there's a couple of things going on here. One is, if you go back all the way to 2011, I think, it was when S&amp;P first downgraded the US sovereign debt, ratings agencies tend to kind of move together, right?Story continuesBecause they're looking at the same things. And so having just one ratings agency out there kind of downgrading the US sovereign debt for 10 years plus sort of indicated that when Moody's kind of made its move-- or sorry. Fitch made its move last week, what that sort of means is that if the US sovereign debt isn't as good as it used to be, then things like banks that are sort of, in some ways, subordinate to the credit of the country they are in, those will naturally kind of have to adjust downward as well. So that's part of it.The other part of it is that banks margins are getting squeezed in this sort of interest rate environment, right? So it now costs more to get your deposits. That's what you use to make loans. And you also have all these loans on your books that are at lower interest rates than what the prevailing rates of right now are. And, of course, you have the economy sort of cooling. So loan demand is also going down, making it harder to replace your low interest bearing loans or assets with higher interest bearing assets.So all this is of a piece, and what do I make of it? I think it seems like what it makes is it makes an already sort of tense lending environment just a little bit more tense and makes the margins a little bit more thin at a time when we're also looking at, maybe, commercial real estate having a big drop off. Any sort of external variable that that could create more uncertainty in this area is just all the more dangerous.- And so from your perspective, and just trying to summarize this too, is this a result of Fed policy or more a result of bank management?JOHN HELTMAN: I think it's-- certainly, the rising interest rates over the last year is the proximate cause of all of this. That's what's making banks' cost of funds go up, thus squeezing their margins and so on and so forth. But at the same time, the Fed isn't doing this to hurt banks. They're doing this to get inflation under control, which is arguably as or more important than banks' profit margins.- And something else that you're covering, by the way, that I want to turn to is using US lender or borrowers data. I should say and this is something that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is taking a look at. What do we need to know about it?JOHN HELTMAN: So the CFPB has said they're going to put out a proposed rule on data brokers. So the CFPB has explicitly declined to say what companies specifically would be affected by this. But it's a lot. So anyone who does data aggregation, data brokerage-- think your Googles, your Amazons, but also lots and lots of fintechs are in this space, using kind of consumer data and selling it for advertising, all sorts of different things.What this rule would do is sort of say that this kind of data collection, data collection of credit-related information can only be used for credit-related purposes, not for advertising or for whatever else. And that is definitely going to affect a lot of big data firms were this to be finalized.- How will this impact some of the social media companies where more transactions are taking place, there is more for alternative data, perhaps, that they're able to carve out and really index and fine tune based on interactions that take place in engagement that take place on their website. And for some of that, they're able to monetize that, and ultimately turn that into not just their own method of monetizing it, but a mechanism for having a commerce-type marketplace on their platform.JOHN HELTMAN: So I would assume that your Metas and your Amazons have very smart people who can figure out how to stay, to continue to operate some level of data sharing even under this rule. But the rule itself seems pretty chilling. It basically says, you can't sell consumer data-- now you can't sell consumer data without their consent.So maybe you could get people to consent to things, but yeah. It'd be pretty drastic. And now, the one thing that's interesting about this is that were this rule to be finalized and then for a Republican to take the White House in 2024, there's potential-- and for Republicans to take the House and Senate as well, you could pass something called the Congressional Review Act that would nullify this rule.However, unlike most things that CFPB does, this actually has a lot of bipartisan support. A lot of people in Congress on both sides of the aisle are pretty sick of the way that data companies kind of buying shares personal consumer information with-- in a lot of cases, without their consent.- It's really interesting. John, thanks so much for helping us break this down and reporting on this this morning. American Banker Washington Bureau Chief Jonathan Heltman, appreciate the time as always.JOHN HELTMAN: Thanks.]"

Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 64% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cintas. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cintas?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Cintas does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cintas' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Cintas is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Cintas' case, its Top Key Executive, Scott Farmer, is the largest shareholder, holding 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 7.9% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of CintasThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Cintas Corporation.

""Promotions, pricing, and so forth are certainly top of mind, there's a price sensitivity on the part of consumers, but they continue to spend,"" McGee tells Yahoo Finance Live. Given that price sensitivity, ""discount retailers are en vogue right now,"" so retailers like Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) will do well in an environment where ""consumers are going to continue to spend, but they're price conscious, so they are going to look to retailers that offer discounts,"" McGee said.Click here to see more from the Yahoo Finance series ""Retail Evolution: The New Era.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, consumers keep spending. Retail sales for July topped expectations, as spending rose across a number of categories, including food services, clothing stores, and sporting goods. So what does this tell us about the state of the consumer? Let's bring in Tom McGee, CEO of ICSC, the International Council of Shopping Centers. He's joining us as part of Yahoo Finance's week-long special, ""Retail Evolution-- The New Era.""Tom, it's good to talk to you today. You know, the word we keep hearing over and over about the consumer is ""cautious."" and Yet you look at the retail sales numbers, they came in stronger than expected. What's the mindset right now?TOM MCGEE: I think ""cautious"" is a good word. You know, obviously, resilient for sure. Retail sales this month were strong in almost every category. You know, as you show here on the screen, ex auto up 1%, pretty broad based, the things that were down were really things that are somewhat attributable to things that tend to follow housing and people buying homes and so forth.And so broad-based, the retailer continues to be-- the consumer continues to be resilient. And when you look at things like back to school, you know, our expectation for back to school is that, you know, spending will increase by about 6.5% year-over-year. But the consumer is very-- you know, continues to be concerned about inflation. And so inflation does influence their buying decisions. That's why you see some big ticket items perhaps down year-over-year.Story continuesBut, you know, promotions, pricing, and so forth are certainly top of mind. There's a price sensitivity on the part of consumers. But they continue to spend for sure.SEANA SMITH: Tom, you mentioned the fact that you're expecting an uptick here in back to school spending. Is that because of inflation, or are people buying more items?TOM MCGEE: It's a little bit of both. Our 6.5%, that would exceed the expected inflation rate. But consumers are very sensitive to inflation. You know, 9 out of 10 of the folks that are going to buy for back to school will look for promotions. They're going to be price sensitive. They're looking for a discount items that might influence the brands they buy, particularly things like apparel, and where they buy-- discount stores versus luxury items.But they're still spending. And, you know, one interesting thing is that you saw sporting goods sales went up in July pretty substantially year-over-year. And that is one of the areas that parents are spending this year is in sporting goods items, because, obviously, when you go back to school, people start focusing on athletics as well.AKIKO FUJITA: So Tom, what does this mean for, you know, what we consider to be more traditional retailers that the big box names? We have heard over and over that it's about, you know, core spending. It's not about discretionary spending. We heard from Home Depot today saying that they're not going to be raising prices anymore. I mean, the pricing certainly feels like it's coming into focus more and more from a retailer standpoint because of how cautious the consumer is turning.TOM MCGEE: You know, certainly, discount retailers are in vogue right now. I mean that consumers are price-sensitive. And so, you know, they are drawing large crowds. When you look at somebody like Home Depot, some of that has to do with what's happening in the housing market as well, because there's somewhat housing dependent.But discount, you know, discount retail, things like Target, Walmart, et cetera are going to do well in this environment where consumers are continuing to spend, but they're price-conscious. And so they're going to look to retailers that offer discounts.SEANA SMITH: Tom, from the shopping center perspective, what are you seeing in terms of occupancy rates? And given the fact that we are in a very uncertain economic environment right now, how is the industry, how are retailers positioned?TOM MCGEE: Yeah. Suburban retail is on fire right now. So, you know, the work-from-home phenomenon has clearly benefited suburban retail. People are working from home more often. They have more free time. So they're shopping more, both traditional retail shopping and going out to eat at local food and beverage. The urban retail is challenged. And it's challenged because of, again, the contrast from working from home is not going into the office. And so the strain on the office market has impacted urban retail.But the vast majority of retail space is in the suburbs. And so occupancy across the industry is almost 93%. It's very, very strong. And so that's doing very well. And you know, stores are being used not just for traditional shopping, but retailers are increasingly using their stores for fulfillment, as many fulfillment centers. So solving for that last mile, either shipping from stores or having customers come in to fulfill online orders. So you're seeing retail, the use of physical retail really have multiple dimensions now beyond just traditional shopping.SEANA SMITH: And adapt to the new environment that we're in. All right, Tom McGee, ICSC CEO, thanks for joining.TOM MCGEE: Thank you.]"
21,59f046cb-6fa7-3882-bb50-94ffb0b30f1a,WMT,2023-08-16,Walmart set to raise its full-year forecast as shoppers stick to essentials,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-set-raise-full-forecast-205751235.html,1692133071,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', 'SF', 'COST']","[(This Aug. 15 story has been corrected to clarify that CFRA is a research company and not a brokerage firm, in paragraph 14)By Siddharth CavaleNEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart is set to raise its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday when it reports quarterly results, as U.S. shoppers continue to buy essentials even as borrowing costs rise, lending standards tighten and the employment picture weakens.The world's largest retailer, as measured by sales, will offer a glimpse into demand for back-to-school products.A monthly survey conducted by brokerage Stifel in August showed that more people intend to shop at Walmart compared to Costco and Target, even as they planned to spend 16% less on back-to-school purchases this year compared to a year ago.""We find the anticipated lower spending notable and a watch-point, as it suggests continued weakness in general merchandise categories,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said.Walmart is in a sweet spot among retailers as broader economic stresses push more people to shop for essentials such as groceries, its core business. Selling toilet paper, beans, pasta and toothpaste brings people into its stores, giving Walmart opportunities to cross sell more profitable merchandise including pens, notepads and backpacks.With more and more shoppers visiting Walmart's Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and its online website for their daily needs, the retailer issued upbeat second-quarter forecasts and raised profit and sales estimates for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024.Rival Target, which reports results on Wednesday, in contrast expects a dour second-quarter and a drop in sales for its fiscal year. Target has a smaller grocery business than Walmart's and has focused on selling clothes, electronics and beauty products to inflation-squeezed Americans.Many are instead spending more on dining out, hobbies and sporting equipment, as demonstrated by the latest U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday.Story continuesHome Depot on Tuesday reiterated its muted forecast for the year after it said it saw continued caution on the part of consumers towards big ticket items and discretionary categories.Walmart, which is known for its low prices, drew in shoppers earning more than $100,000 a year during peak inflation in 2022.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in May cautioned that stubborn inflation, especially in food, was ""one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year.""Since then, food inflation has eased, however. And in July, Walmart announced that it would sell 14 of the most popular items on school supply lists, including Pen + Gear Composition notebooks and 24-count Crayola Crayons, at the same prices as last year.""As a retail bellwether Walmart's comments on back to school trends will be a market mover as well as a preview of potential holiday trends,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said, adding that back-to-school trends have led the direction of holiday sales in 23 of the last 29 years.Brokerages UBS, Credit Suisse, Telsey Advisory Group and research firm CFRA Research expect Walmart to raise its full-year forecast for the second time this year.Walmart in May forecast net sales would rise about 3.5% this fiscal year, up from its prior outlook in February of a 2.5% to 3% rise, in part due to higher prices. It also raised its earnings forecast.Capital Wealth Planning, a Walmart investor, owns $258 million in Walmart shares after raising its stake in the company in June.The firm's founder Kevin Simpson said he is hesitant to buy more stock unless the retailer can show it is able to expand margins without solely relying on inflation-driven price hikes.Walmart trades at 24.2 times 12-month forward earnings compared to 14.9 times for Target and 19.9 times for the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index, according to Refinitiv DataStream. Simpson characterized Walmart's current multiple as ""high.""""I need to see earnings increasing more than anything else because that's the only thing that can justify a higher stock price over time,"" Simpson told Reuters.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Deepa Babington)]"
22,b395ce77-67e1-368d-94b1-2c962d2a8cd5,WMT,2023-08-16,Brokers Suggest Investing in Walmart (WMT): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-walmart-wmt-173946316.html,1692121186,STORY,['WMT'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69% and 13.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WMT Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $6.25.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $162.78 in the previous session. Walmart has gained 12.8% since the start of the year compared to the 20.3% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 13.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 18, 2023, Walmart reported EPS of $1.47 versus consensus estimate of $1.32.For the current fiscal year, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $6.25 per share on $637.37 billion in revenues. This represents a -0.64% change in EPS on a 4.27% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.92 per share on $660.49 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.7% and 3.63%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWalmart may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Walmart has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 25.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.3X versus its peer group's average of 5.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.89. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Walmart fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Walmart shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While much has been said about the technology’s potential threats — replacing jobs — another trend is emerging in parallel: companies searching to hire AI-skilled employees and being ready to pay top dollar for them.See: 7 Ways To Earn Money on Upwork With ChatGPTFind: 5 Ways To Use AI To Generate Passive IncomeThe Wall Street Journal reported that companies are competing to lure talent and looking to avoid losing out to rivals, with salaries almost reaching seven figures.For instance, Netflix has a job posting regarding a product manager position for a machine-learning platform. The position offers a total compensation of up to $900,000 annually, according to the posting.And The Wall Street Journal reported that online dating platform Hinge is looking for a president of AI — a job that comes with a base salary of $332,000 to $398,000 a year. Meanwhile, a vice president of AI and machine-learning position at Upwork boasts an advertised salary of $260,000 to $437,000 a year, a senior manager of applied science and generative AI at Amazon lists a top salary of $340,300 and Walmart is hiring for a position on its conversational AI team. Walmart is offering a base salary of $168,000 to $252,000 annually.According to Peter Cohan — associate professor of management practice, Babson College — while fear mongers wail about how many jobs generative AI will destroy, the reality is more complicated.Cohan said generative AI will create some new jobs, will remove the drudgery from many other jobs and will — as many fear — eliminate jobs.Yet, he also noted that of the new jobs generative AI will create, only a tiny fraction of workers have the education and experience required to attract offers topping $1 million.“The average worker will not qualify for such jobs and is unlikely to be able to obtain the education and experience needed to qualify before the generative AI boom levels off,” said Cohan. “My first thought when I read generative AI jobs were going for $900,000 was that those high salaries were typical of an expanding bubble. How long that bubble expands before bursting depends on whether companies can keep investing in high payoff generative AI applications to justify employing such pricey talent. If generative AI does not pay off, those highly paid people could find themselves out of a job.”Story continuesAlso: 10 Best ChatGPT Prompts To Use for Making MoneyAs The Wall Street Journal explained, some companies said they would need to train existing employees to take on AI projects because there are too few mid-level or senior employees with the desired skills.

EHTH revised its guidance for major metrics upward during the second quarter results announcement, which indicates improving operations. It expects total revenues for 2023 to be within $439-$459 million, up from the year-ago level of $405.4 million. Higher revenues from Individual, Family and Small Business, and Medicare businesses are likely to boost the top line in 2023.The rising top line, coupled with lower costs, thanks to its transformation initiatives, is expected to reduce losses in 2023. It expects GAAP net loss for the year to be within $26-$46 million, narrowing from the previously guided range of $35-$55 million. Further, EHTH anticipates its adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be within a loss of $3 million and a profit of $17 million, which also shows improvement from the previous guidance.Now, if we look at its surprise history, eHealth beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters and missed twice, with an average surprise of 33.4%.It reaffirmed its 2023 operating cash outflow guidance range of $30-$15 million. To understand how its business performance is improving and whether it can reach the guidelines, let’s take a look at its results from the last reported quarter.Q2 EarningseHealth reported a second-quarter 2023 adjusted loss of $1.05 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.5%. The bottom line, however, narrowed from the prior-year quarter’s loss of $1.15 per share.Lower Medicare Advantage members, ancillary product members and individual and family plan approved members affected its second-quarter earnings. The negatives were partially offset by increased lifetime value (“LTV”), commissions and its transformation initiatives. Lower operating costs further benefited the bottom line.The top line increased 32% year over year to $66.8 million. The figure beat the consensus mark by 33.9%.Operational UpdateeHealth reported commissions of $60.2 million for the quarter, up 26% year over year. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.1%. Other revenues jumped 156% from the prior-year period to $6.6 million, beating the consensus mark by 163.3%.Story continuesThe total operating costs and expenses declined 3% year over year to $92.9 million in the second quarter. Lower marketing and advertising, technology and content expenses and cost of revenues were partially offset by higher customer care and enrollment, and general and administrative costs.Net loss improved 37% year over year to $23.5 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $14.8 million in the quarter under review, showing an improvement of 55% from a year ago.Segmental UpdateMedicare: Revenues from the segment jumped 35% year over year to $55.4 million, beating the consensus mark by 41.7%. Segmental loss narrowed 81% year over year to $4.7 million due to its transformation initiatives. The segment was supported by increased commissions, partially offset by lower Medicare Advantage plan approved members.Individual, Family and Small Business: Revenues from the segment climbed 21% year over year to $11.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.5%. Segmental profit surged 54% year over year to $6.7 million. The segment benefited from higher LTV, partially offset by decreased ancillary product approved members and individual and family plan approved members.Financial Update (as of Jun 30, 2023)eHealth exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $153.2 million, which rose from the 2022-end level of $144.4 million. Total assets of $1,053.4 million decreased from the figure of $1,112.6 million at 2022 end.Long-term debt was $66.9 million at the second-quarter end, marginally up from $66.1 million at 2022-end.Total shareholders’ equity of $600.9 million decreased from the 2022-end level of $651 million.Operating cash outflow in the second quarter of 2023 was recorded at $9.4 million, down from $25.8 million in the year-ago period. This shows growing strength in operations.How Did EHTH’s Industry Peers Fare in Q2?eHealth belongs to the Zacks Insurance Brokerage industry, which also includes bigger market players like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, Aon plc AON and Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG.Marsh &amp; McLennan reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.20, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% thanks to a strong performance of the Risk and Insurance Services segment, led by the Marsh business' robust international operations. A well-performing Consulting unit also contributed to the upside. However, an elevated expense level partially offset the results.Aon reported second-quarter 2023 operating earnings of $2.76 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82 due to increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partly offset by strong retention, business generation, growth in core P&amp;C, and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Asia and Pacific region operations.Arthur J. Gallagher reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted net earnings of $1.90 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1% thanks to higher adjusted revenues and margin expansion across the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, partially offset by higher expenses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WTW has sufficient cash reserves to meet its short-term debt obligations. It expects approximately 12% free cash flow margin for 2023. Looking beyond 2023, Willis Towers expects free cash flow margin to increase due to improved cash conversion in TRANZACT business and the abatement of transformation-related spend.

With a solid financial position, it intends to continue to reward its shareholders, technology and new business opportunities and pursue opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.Willis Towers' expenses have been rising over the last several quarters, resulting in the contraction of margins.

Its rental income of $717.3 million increased 4.4% year over year and also exceeded the consensus mark of $715.1 million.Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s president and CEO noted that the supply picture in the coastal markets where EQR mainly operates “remains favorable”, plus “demand is steady”, and there is “continued progress in mitigating delinquency in Southern California.”Analysts also seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Shares of Equity Residential have gained 3.8% against the industry’s decline of 1.1% in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Make Equity Residential a Solid PickStrategic Portfolio Positioning and Technology Initiatives: Equity Residential is targeting locations within dynamic markets where affluent long-term renters want to live, work and play. Its portfolio comprises a mixture of urban and suburban properties in the knowledge centers of today’s economy and the resident demographic opts for rent for lifestyle reasons.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. These include the installation of smart home technology and smart access aimed at elevating customer experience. These efforts are likely to provide Equity Residential with a competitive edge over others.Healthy Operating Performance: With an affluent tenant base and portfolio diversification efforts, EQR enjoys healthy operating performance. In the second quarter, EQR’s same-store residential revenues were up 5.5% year over year, while expenses increased 5.3%. Consequently, same-store residential net operating income (NOI) expanded 5.6% year over year. The new lease change for its residential same-store properties was up 2.3%, while the renewal rate achieved by EQR was 5.9% for the second quarter. The blended rate for the quarter was 4.3%.

The net debt to normalized EBITDAre was 4.27X, while the unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI was 88.5% in the quarter, up from 88.3% reported in the prior quarter. Further, an A-rated balance sheet renders the company favorable access to the debt market.In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 7.40% compared with the industry’s average of 4.35%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.With a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, a large pool of high-quality unencumbered assets and strong long-term credit ratings, EQR is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.FFO Growth:  FFO per share is expected to be up 6.25% in 2023 compared with the industry’s average of 5.01%.Along with the second-quarter 2023 earnings release, Equity Residential updated the 2023 guidance due to pending favorable refinancing activity and second-half same-store expense projections lower than what was previously expected.

Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith examines the U.S. companies that have the most exposure to Chinese markets and consumers, including Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Starbucks (SBUX), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), L.V. Sands (LVS), and MGM Resorts (MGM).Video Transcript- The economic slowdown in China could send shockwaves into corporate America. Brad Smith is here with a closer look at some of the companies that could be hit because of their exposure to China. What do you have?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, so it's really interesting to track some of the data that has come out that has disappointed to this far. You think about some of the economic growth data that has really been lackluster to this point in time, especially in comparison to a lot of the reopening trade that, once again, recommenced but in a different nation.In China, the second largest GDP or second largest economy by GDP in the world here. And that ensues an issue because you had a lot of the hopes of investors and among regulators in China hoping that bounce back would move forward here. So just a few data points here, let's throw out real quick.The economic data in July, particularly here, you think about some of the Industrial output failing to meet expectations. In retail sales, failing to meet expectations. And then additionally here, this really pushed forward that larger concern for where growth would actually come in.If you ask Barclays who came out this morning and cut their own GDP growth forecast to 4 and 1/2% for China, that mirrors some of what we had already heard across the street and particularly, how investors are having to continue to think about this.So two ways that I want to really break this down and one of them stems from what we still have yet to see and how one of our guests earlier had classified what is taking place in China right now. And for that, let me bring in Exante Data founder and CEO, Jens Nordvig who had this to say earlier on.Story continuesJENS NORDVIG: When I look at the data in China-- I've been covering China for about 20 years, I've never seen this type of weakness where it feels like you have a real confidence issue where the consumer is starting to get extremely nervous, worried about the future, and holding back.And it was difficult to see it very clearly in the data, right? Because we had that bounce because of the reopening but under the surface, we have a confidence issue that is very severe and that's certainly going to have spillovers into stock markets around the world.BRAD SMITH: And so with that spillover, here's where it becomes interesting is what is the actual policy that is going to be enacted in order to generate that demand? Well it's kind of similar to what we've seen here in the US.You think about how the Fed has needed to take certain activities to ensure that people are dampening down on their amount of spending? Well, it's the opposite. What does stimulus look like in China and that moving forward to try and spur spending? China's central bank, they've moved their lending and repurchase rates lower, putting those-- and particularly slashing those as the second largest economy is trying to reverse the course of its slowdown here.And then additionally when you think about that policy vacuum, he actually-- Nordvig went on to say during that conversation, we are in a policy vacuum where there seems to be some internal disagreement about what should be the policy from here and that's creating a lag and delay and that is making markets very, very uncomfortable.Now, if you're thinking about the equity markets in some of the players that could be most notably impact, look to some of the US publicly traded companies that have the most exposure to China. Let's look at it from two frames of mind here. Tesla, Apple, Starbucks, you're seeing them on their screen.Far different companies. But still one that relies heavily on these spending propensity from the consumer in China as they've all got growth ambitions whether technologically in Apple's kind of handset or smartphone realm and trying to make sure that they're taking on more market share or even in the highly competitive automotive landscape where Tesla has continued to build up its ambitions both for manufacturing and selling in China.And then additionally, you mentioned Starbucks. Some people just need to have a good cup of coffee sometimes and that's in China too. Also here, just lastly before I leave you, if the consumer is not spending as much on physical goods, are they spending into services?That's a big question or is that service gambling? Now this is something where it could be interesting and I've been taking a look at shares of these major gambling houses or wagering houses, betting houses, however you want to look at it.It's a Casino operator, folks. Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, all of these companies who have some type of experience that they have either built out in China in Macau or tried to cozy up to the potential gambling society or gamblers that are placing their wagers in one way or another. So if you're not spending on physical goods, maybe you're spending into services but are you wagering your money? And that's a big question and some investors would say, heck no.- Yeah. I don't know. The outlook for a number of those casino operators that have heavy exposure to China and also some of those retailers that do a lot of business in China certainly headwinds at least in the short term there for those companies. All right, Brad. Thanks.]"

LVS is benefiting from impressive travel and tourism recovery in Macao and Singapore. Furthermore, the company’s long-term investment commitment in Macao, and renovation and refurbishment program of Marina Bay Sands bode well.However, high debt and stiff competition are primary concerns.Let’s delve deeper.Factors in FavorLas Vegas Sands has witnessed impressive growth trends post the easing of travel restrictions. In the second quarter of 2023, significant growth in property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy in the Macao region was noticed. Visitation in China (excluding Guangdong province) was approximately 51% while the same in Macao was approximately 70% of the 2019 visitation level in the quarter. The relaxation in travel restriction, as well as an increase in flight capacity, have ensured the continuous market visitation recovery. With the easing of restrictions and recovery in travel and tourism, the company anticipates generating strong cash flows from the region in the days ahead.Furthermore, Las Vegas Sands’ long-term commitment of $3.8 billion investment in Macao (through 2032), especially in non-gaming, also positioned it impressively well for delivering solid growth in second-quarter 2023. Backed by its long-term commitment investments, LVS aims to capitalize on the likely structural growth in Macao to stay ahead of the curve in terms of quality and scale of its product and amenities. The company stays focused on expanding non-gaming opportunities in Macao.Increased focus on the Singapore market bode well. In second-quarter 2023, Marina Bay Sands (MBS) achieved solid growth in both gaming and non-gaming segments despite the persisting airlift constraints (primarily from China). As of Jun 30, 2023, the company introduced approximately 1,100 redefined rooms including about 250 new luxurious suites in MBS. Furthermore, certain other improvements in gaming, dining, entertainment and retail offerings were made alongside. Going forward, the company remains optimistic in this regard and anticipates the initiatives to drive growth.Story continuesFactors Impeding GrowthLas Vegas Sands’ growth momentum is hindered by its high debt position. Given the ongoing economic uncertainties, maintaining sufficient liquidity has become a herculean task for the company. Total debt outstanding (excluding finance leases and financed purchases) was $14.7 billion, compared with $15.97 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. Although the debt level was sequentially lower, it is still on the higher side compared to LVS’ cash balance. The cash balance, as of Jun 30, 2023, was $5.77 billion, down from $6.53 billion reported in the previous quarter.Additionally, increased hotel openings and promotional activities have made Las Vegas and Macao markets highly competitive. Thus, excess supply, especially in the Macao market, might reduce the company’s market share.A Brief Review of the Other StocksMGM Resorts International MGM: The company is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from the MGM China segment and a rise in visitation. MGM China’s casino revenues skyrocketed 454% year over year to $670 million. Its adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) amounted to $209 million against ($52) million reported in the prior-year quarter. The aforementioned tailwinds backed the uptrend. Also, the company emphasizes on international expansion to drive growth.Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN: The company is riding on consistent performance growth in its Macau and North America properties. WYNN witnessed growth in mass gaming, luxury retail and hotel businesses in Macau, portraying exceptional post-Covid recovery. In the second quarter of 2023, the top line increased 75.6% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by the performance growth in Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, resulting from an increase in gaming volumes, hotel occupancy and covers at restaurants. Notably, in the quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $524.5 million, compared with $179.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD: The company is benefiting from solid contributions from online gaming and management fees (from Sky River Casino). Also, its emphasis on strengthening current operations and growth through capital investment and other strategic measures bode well. Moreover, the expansion of online betting offerings bodes well. During second-quarter 2023, the company repurchased shares of its common stock worth $100 million. As of Jun 30, 2023, BYD stated the availability of $533 million under its repurchase program.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Microchip Technology's shares on or after the 21st of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 5th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Microchip Technology has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current stock price of $80.89. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Microchip Technology's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Microchip Technology can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Microchip Technology paid out a comfortable 31% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 23% of its free cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Microchip Technology has grown its earnings rapidly, up 52% a year for the past five years. Microchip Technology is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Microchip Technology has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Microchip Technology worth buying for its dividend? We love that Microchip Technology is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Microchip Technology looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

Investors were waiting for minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting, due out later on Wednesday.The MSCI World stock index was down 0.19% as of 0845 GMT. It was dragged lower by a sharp drop in Asian equities, with the MSCI Asia index, which excludes Japan, falling 0.98%.""Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.,"" said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.Yet he added: ""The news are not unanimously bad. After all, China is exporting deflation to the rest of the world.""China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday, the latest in a string of downbeat numbers that point to a rapid loss in economic momentum.On Tuesday, China reported weaker-than-expected July activity data. The Chinese central bank also unexpectedly lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of disappointing figures and the arrival of deflation in July, but investors have so far been underwhelmed by the response.Europe's STOXX 600 stock index rose 0.2% in early trading on Wednesday, but failed to recover Tuesday's 0.93% fall, which was driven by concerns about global inflation and China.Germany's DAX was up 0.23% after losing 0.86% on Tuesday, while Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.09% following a 1.57% drop.U.S. futures pointed to a brighter start on Wall Street, with S&amp;P contracts up 0.24% and Nasdaq contracts 0.31% higher.Story continuesThe S&amp;P 500 fell 1.16% on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data added to the pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates at high levels.In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell sharply in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. Sterling was last up 0.46% at $1.276.The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.22% at 102.98, ending a run of four straight daily increases.Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China. The euro was up 0.23% at $1.093.Investors will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed is probably finished with interest-rate rises.""There's very little priced in for the September meeting and there's only 10 basis points priced in for the early November meeting, which I think is significantly underpricing the risks that there will be a rate hike at one of those two meetings,"" said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 3 basis points at 4.188% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.U.S. crude oil was down 0.19% at $81.15 a barrel, while Brent fell 0.20% to $85.06 a barrel.Spot gold was up 0.15% at around $1,904.60 an ounce.(Reporting by Harry Robertson in London and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Sam Holmes and Tomasz Janowski)]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this investment bank have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of -8.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.14 indicates a change of +22.5% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.78 billion and $58.47 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +6.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, persistently rising expenses and the uncertain performance of capital markets are concerns.Morgan Stanley’s strategic buyouts, which aim to increase dependence on reliable revenue sources, are commendable. Driven by these efforts, its Wealth Management (""WM"") and Investment Management (""IM"") segments’ aggregate contribution to net revenues jumped to almost 55% in 2022 from 26% in 2010.However, the difficult operating backdrop in the near term is expected to hamper growth in WM and IM segments to an extent. The trend is likely to improve once the operating environment becomes more favorable. We project both segments' contribution (in aggregate) to the top line to be more than 57.5% in 2023.Morgan Stanley’s partnership with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. MUFG is expected to keep supporting profitability. This July, the companies announced plans to deepen their 15-year alliance by merging certain operations within their Japanese brokerage joint ventures. The new strategic alliance will see combined Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.Also, their equity underwriting business will be rearranged between the two brokerage units. The implementation of this expanded alliance is scheduled for the first half of 2024, subject to regulatory approval. These efforts will further solidify the company’s position in Japan’s market.Following the 2023 stress test results, MS increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 85 cents per share and reauthorized a new multi-year share repurchase program of up to $20 billion, beginning in the third quarter of 2023. The company is expected to be able to continue with efficient capital deployments, given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength.Story continuesLikewise, after clearing this year's stress test, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM announced plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share. JPM also plans to continue with its previously announced share repurchase program worth $12 billion for 2023.However, Morgan Stanley has witnessed a continuous rise in expenses. Though expenses declined in 2022, it witnessed a three-year (2019-2022) CAGR of 9.3%. The uptrend continued in the first half of 2023. Going forward, expenses are expected to remain elevated, given the steady increase in revenues and inflationary pressure, as well as the company’s investments in franchise and inorganic growth efforts. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses suggest an increase of 4.4% this year.The performance of Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities (""IS"") segment, constituting the trading and investment banking businesses, depends on the performance of the capital markets. The future performance of the segment remains uncertain as the current global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be influenced by elevated inflation, higher rates, worsening macroeconomic outlook and volatility across the global financial markets.Though Morgan Stanley sees signs of growing M&amp;A and underwriting pipelines, the financial impact is expected in the second half of 2023 and 2024. We anticipate the IS segment's revenues to decline 5.1% in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

She oversees all aspects of SEE's legal and compliance affairs, serves as the executive sponsor of SEE's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, and leads the company's ESG Executive Steering Committee.How Does SEE Approach ESG?Our approach is built on the belief that effective management of ESG-related matters positions SEE to create value for stakeholders and society while reducing risks. We have an ESG Executive Steering Committee that consists of five members of the company's executive leadership team who work with a cross-functional extended ESG leadership team. Together, we drive the integration of ESG across our business, engage with stakeholders, advance initiatives, and measure and report our performance. We take pride in the exceptional level of collaboration among our people, our leadership, and our Board of Directors. The progress we have made in our ESG program and reporting over the last few years reflects that collaboration.What Are the ESG Leadership Team's Priorities?We are making significant progress towards improving transparency, aligning with ESG standards and best practices, and communicating with stakeholders. There will be many additional efforts on SEE's part as we continue to make progress. We will take a disciplined focus on ESG integration and create programs and initiatives around each of the topics that matter most. We will develop reliable and consistent metrics for measuring our performance and will continue building our roadmap and sharing our progress with stakeholders.What is the Board of Directors' Role in ESG?The Board of Directors is SEE's highest governing body and is highly engaged in overseeing our sustainability and people strategies as well as other material ESG issues. Recognizing the importance of ESG, the Board designated its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to oversee SEE's ESG strategy and designated the Organization and Compensation Committee to manage the company's workforce and people management strategies, including those relating to corporate culture, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. I am pleased to work closely with our Board as it embraces SEE's purpose of making our world better than we find it.Story continuesHow Does SEE View Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace?From a business standpoint, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are imperative to SEE. Numerous studies show that when people feel more included, they are more engaged and motivated, which positively impacts people and business performance.From a personal standpoint, I think DEI makes us all better. As a leader and former athlete, some of the greatest teams on which I have been a member have consisted of people who bring their best selves and talents to the team, spend time getting to know and appreciating one another, and are open to learning from one another. When we do those things among people with different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences - coupled with some hard work and grit - it builds trust and sets the stage for the team to succeed.

""Gold Rush"": Focus on 3 Stocks Selling the ""Picks""The AI Arms RaceOpenAI and Microsoft’s AI “Chatbot” ChatGPT shocked the world in late 2022 with its capability, speed, and user growth. Less than a week after launching, ChatGPT reached a billion users, reaching the milestone well before previous consumer application record holders like Instagram (took more than two months) and Netflix (took 3.5 years). A few months after ChatGPT went mainstream, Googlelaunched its Chatbot named Bard.Competition Heating upLike the internet boom of the late 1990s, innovators nationwide are beginning to understand how transformative and potentially profitable the technology can be. Today, we know that Google beat out Yahoo! and others in the search engine wars. However, before these juggernauts became dominant in their respective spaces, it was unclear who would win out of the thousands of competitors who ultimately made it. While ChatGPT is the early leader, the race has just begun. Despite the tough competition, the rewards are perceived to be enough such that innovators worldwide are racing for AI supremacy.Why Search for “Gold” When you can Sell the “Picks”?Investors looking to cash in on the AI revolution have two choices: bet on a company they think can win the AI race, or bet on the companies that are necessary to run AI. In my mind, the odds favor the latter. Below are 3 such companies that are buyable now:Semiconductors Will Power AIZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the obvious choice. Nvidia is the market leader in high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, computing, and accelerated computing.4 Billion Reasons to BuyLast quarter, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by upping quarterly revenue guidance to $11 billion after announcing revenue of $7 billion. Wall Street is catching up – for the current year, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest NVDA will grow eps at a cool 133.23%Story continuesGlobal AdoptionWhat analysts may not foresee is the global adoption taking place. China’s internet giants want to buy $5 billion worth of high-performance Nvidia chips used in generative AI. The buying mania comes as tensions between the US and China hit a fever pitch.Quantum Computing Will Lead to Cost SavingsIonq is the only pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock. The company’s website says, “The dawn of the quantum age is here. IonQ is developing quantum computers designed to solve the world’s most complex problems and transform business, societies, and the planet for the better.”AI Isn’t CheapDid you know it costs about $100 thousand daily to run ChatGPT? Meanwhile, Google’s Bard Chatbot costs about ten times more than a standard Google keyword search. As AI grows in popularity, these costs will only increase. Quantum computing companies like IonQ are a potential solution. IonQ can help companies like Google run the large language models (LLMs) necessary for generative AI at a fraction of the cost.Investors are noticing the potential. Year-to-date, IonQ shares are up 348%. However, in the past few weeks, the stock has finally retreated to the 50-day moving average, offering investors another chance to get on board.IonQ is just getting started. Like anything in economics, supply and demand forces are critical for determining future prices. Because IonQ has a tiny share float (# of shares available for trading by the public) of ~159 million shares, continued positive news may send shares even higher.AI Will Drive Cloud &amp; Database GrowthZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Stock Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Benefitting from the AI RevolutionOracle is likely to continue to grow rapidly due to the AI revolution. The company offers AI-driven solutions and tools to help businesses integrate machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into their applications and processes – something almost every big tech company is rushing to do.13F Shows Smart Money is Entering the StockLegendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller has famously never had a down year in more than 30 years of investing. Druckenmiller’s 13F disclosure shows that ORCL is a new buy for him. Steady MoverDespite Oracle’s massive size, it is talked about less than stocks such as Microsoft and Amazon.Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are an investor's dream.Technical BreakoutOracle is breaking out of a classic bull wedge today. Furthermore, while the Nasdaq is deep in the red, ORCL is green and is exhibiting relative strength – a bullish sign.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The addition expands other coordinated primary care practice locations currently open across the country such as Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Rhode Island.Village Medical at Walgreens locations accepts a wide range of health insurance options, including Medicaid and Medicare. Patients can seek care and support through in-person, at-home and telehealth visits as well.Significance of the Integrated Primary Care ModelThrough the partnership, Village Medical physicians and Walgreens pharmacists work together to offer full-service primary care for everyday illnesses and injuries as well as the management of chronic conditions. The team collaborates closely to fill prescriptions immediately following medical visits at the same location if patients prefer so. This ensures their access to high-quality care and medical expertise.At the practice, which is conveniently situated alongside a Walgreens pharmacy location, physicians and pharmacists are supported with high-tech tools, optimized electronic medical records and reduced administrative tasks. These empower them to focus on providing patient care and achieving positive health outcomes.News in DetailAccording to a published estimate quoted by Walgreens, the number of people in Illinois with three or more chronic diseases is growing and is expected to reach three million in 2030. Through better prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, the survey found that nearly 45,400 lives in Illinois could be saved annually.While patients may find it overwhelming to keep up with appointments to manage chronic conditions, new and current prescriptions and more, it demonstrates the need for the kind of care Village Medical at Walgreens provides. The combined expertise in primary care and pharmacy allows patients to better manage their care by having a convenient location in their community at the right time.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsOn the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Walgreens announced a scalable partnership with TelePharm to expand tele-pharmacy services, improve access to care and provide patients with the flexibility to engage with the company’s pharmacists.In June 2023, Walgreens and the California-based biotech company, Freenome, announced a multi-year partnership to advance the clinical studies of the latter’s blood-based tests for the early detection of cancer. WBA will leverage its national footprint, patient insights, compliant recruitment technology and local infrastructure to engage diverse patient populations in Freenome’s multi-cancer research program.In April, the company announced a collaboration with Prothena Corporation, a late-stage clinical biotechnology company headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. The insight-driven approach aims to support patient awareness, participation and representation in the clinical trial of Prothena’s Alzheimer’s drug candidate, PRX012. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced three new primary care practices in Colorado, two in Fort Collins and one in Longmont.Updates From PeersAnother bigwig of the retail healthcare industry, CVS Health CVS, too came up with new updates in the same line. CVS with GoodRx GDRX, a leading resource for healthcare savings and information, announced the launch of Caremark Cost Saver last month. Via this program, CVS Caremark’s eligible members will have automatic access to GoodRx’s prescription pricing to allow them to pay lower prices, when available, on generic medications at the pharmacy counter.Another peer of WBA, Herbalife HLF, continues to make progress in implementing its Transformation Program, which was initiated in 2021 to strategically optimize global business processes. Simultaneously, the company’s new, fully integrated, modernized digital technology platform — Herbalife One — is expected to streamline the company’s business, accelerate data utilization, reduce costs and simplify transactions for its distributors and their customers.

Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith examines the U.S. companies that have the most exposure to Chinese markets and consumers, including Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Starbucks (SBUX), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), L.V. Sands (LVS), and MGM Resorts (MGM).Video Transcript- The economic slowdown in China could send shockwaves into corporate America. Brad Smith is here with a closer look at some of the companies that could be hit because of their exposure to China. What do you have?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, so it's really interesting to track some of the data that has come out that has disappointed to this far. You think about some of the economic growth data that has really been lackluster to this point in time, especially in comparison to a lot of the reopening trade that, once again, recommenced but in a different nation.In China, the second largest GDP or second largest economy by GDP in the world here. And that ensues an issue because you had a lot of the hopes of investors and among regulators in China hoping that bounce back would move forward here. So just a few data points here, let's throw out real quick.The economic data in July, particularly here, you think about some of the Industrial output failing to meet expectations. In retail sales, failing to meet expectations. And then additionally here, this really pushed forward that larger concern for where growth would actually come in.If you ask Barclays who came out this morning and cut their own GDP growth forecast to 4 and 1/2% for China, that mirrors some of what we had already heard across the street and particularly, how investors are having to continue to think about this.So two ways that I want to really break this down and one of them stems from what we still have yet to see and how one of our guests earlier had classified what is taking place in China right now. And for that, let me bring in Exante Data founder and CEO, Jens Nordvig who had this to say earlier on.Story continuesJENS NORDVIG: When I look at the data in China-- I've been covering China for about 20 years, I've never seen this type of weakness where it feels like you have a real confidence issue where the consumer is starting to get extremely nervous, worried about the future, and holding back.And it was difficult to see it very clearly in the data, right? Because we had that bounce because of the reopening but under the surface, we have a confidence issue that is very severe and that's certainly going to have spillovers into stock markets around the world.BRAD SMITH: And so with that spillover, here's where it becomes interesting is what is the actual policy that is going to be enacted in order to generate that demand? Well it's kind of similar to what we've seen here in the US.You think about how the Fed has needed to take certain activities to ensure that people are dampening down on their amount of spending? Well, it's the opposite. What does stimulus look like in China and that moving forward to try and spur spending? China's central bank, they've moved their lending and repurchase rates lower, putting those-- and particularly slashing those as the second largest economy is trying to reverse the course of its slowdown here.And then additionally when you think about that policy vacuum, he actually-- Nordvig went on to say during that conversation, we are in a policy vacuum where there seems to be some internal disagreement about what should be the policy from here and that's creating a lag and delay and that is making markets very, very uncomfortable.Now, if you're thinking about the equity markets in some of the players that could be most notably impact, look to some of the US publicly traded companies that have the most exposure to China. Let's look at it from two frames of mind here. Tesla, Apple, Starbucks, you're seeing them on their screen.Far different companies. But still one that relies heavily on these spending propensity from the consumer in China as they've all got growth ambitions whether technologically in Apple's kind of handset or smartphone realm and trying to make sure that they're taking on more market share or even in the highly competitive automotive landscape where Tesla has continued to build up its ambitions both for manufacturing and selling in China.And then additionally, you mentioned Starbucks. Some people just need to have a good cup of coffee sometimes and that's in China too. Also here, just lastly before I leave you, if the consumer is not spending as much on physical goods, are they spending into services?That's a big question or is that service gambling? Now this is something where it could be interesting and I've been taking a look at shares of these major gambling houses or wagering houses, betting houses, however you want to look at it.It's a Casino operator, folks. Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, all of these companies who have some type of experience that they have either built out in China in Macau or tried to cozy up to the potential gambling society or gamblers that are placing their wagers in one way or another. So if you're not spending on physical goods, maybe you're spending into services but are you wagering your money? And that's a big question and some investors would say, heck no.- Yeah. I don't know. The outlook for a number of those casino operators that have heavy exposure to China and also some of those retailers that do a lot of business in China certainly headwinds at least in the short term there for those companies. All right, Brad. Thanks.]"

The company’s expanding wind and solar generation portfolio act as a tailwind.However, the company has to face certain headwinds, such as delay in the closure of PNM Resources’ deal and constraints related to new projects.TailwindsAVANGRID consistently spends capital to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure and facilities. It invested a total of $2.7 billion in 2022, with nearly 71% in its Networks segment and the rest in its Renewables segment. AGR plans to invest $3 billion in 2023 to strengthen its operations. It invested nearly $1.3 billion in the first half of 2023.The company is consistently expanding its clean energy generation capacity by adding more wind and solar sources to its portfolio. In April 2023, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. The agreement aims at exploring opportunities to develop up to 1 Gigawatt of green energy projects within the Navajo Nation in the states of New Mexico and Arizona.In March 2023, AVANGRID announced that it is set to utilize $30 million worth of high-quality solar trackers from the New Mexico based company, Array Technologies (ATI), to develop a 321-Megawatt (MW) solar farm in Texas. The company has increased the presence of sustainable energy in Texas, where it currently produces more than 1,250 MWs through six wind farms and has a pipeline of 1,300 MWs projects.HeadwindsThe delay in the proposed merger of PNM Resources with AVANGRID may adversely affect the latter’s benefits. It can result in additional pre-tax transaction costs and a loss in revenues associated with the uncertainty about the merger.AGR keeps investing in development opportunities but timely completion of the same and that too within budget might not be possible, which might adversely impact its financial condition and prospects.Story continuesTransition in Energy SpaceThe U.S. electric power sector is gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Most of the companies target replacing fossil fuels with renewables and believe in the development of new technologies such as energy storage and hydrogen. They have pledged to deliver 100% clean energy and achieve the zero-emission target in the coming years.To reap the benefits of the expanding renewable energy market, certain companies from the industry such as Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, PPL Corp. PPL and Ameren Corp. AEE are also transitioning faster toward clean energy.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, which excludes $2-$4 billion of potential incremental investment opportunities planned in the same time frame. The company is reducing coal consumption and targets to lower emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.XEL’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.34%.

So, Monster needs to work double duty to overtake its Austrian competitor.Currently California-based Monster holds roughly 43% of the energy drink market by volume in the U.S., compared to Red Bull which stands at 27%, according to HSBC.“Red Bull generally sells for almost double the price of Monster Energy per fluid ounce,” Laboy wrote. “Therefore, to control roughly the same amount of revenue in the U.S. as Red Bull, Monster needs to move roughly double the volume.”Monster’s ability to take the lead in the energy drinks segment ultimately hinges on two things, according to Laboy: the company’s ability to keep a steady pace of sales growth, and its success in capturing the younger, wellness-minded consumers within and outside the U.S.Representatives at Red Bull and Monster didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Carter says she is a Christian who opposes abortion. Southwest denied the allegations.ADF has led efforts to restrict the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone and helped draft a Mississippi law at the center of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last year overturning the national right to abortion.In Tuesday's complaint, Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, said that while training can at times be a fair sanction to impose on a lawyer, Starr's order ""sets a dangerous precedent.""He said such a religious-based sanction was ""unprecedented"" and inconsistent with Canon 3 of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, which holds that ""a judge should perform the duties of the office fairly, impartially and diligently.""Starr in imposing the sanction had cited past cases where lawyers were ordered to attend ethics training.But Roth argued that unlike legal ethics, which have generally agreed upon precepts for training curriculums, religious liberty means different things under different faiths. No sectarian organization of any faith should be allowed to carry out such a court-ordered sanction as a result, he said.Judicial misconduct complaints are subject to dismissal if they directly relate to the merits of a decision.Roth said should the circuit's chief judge determine his complaint should be dismissed under that rule, he requested a ""limited inquiry"" at least be undertaken to determine if ADF and Starr communicated privately beforehand.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Marguerita Choy)]"
81,1daacafe-744e-3735-a759-e8350229a6da,TDG,2023-08-16,Stocks On the Rise: 13 Best To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-rise-13-best-buy-104743336.html,1692182863,STORY,"['CPRT', 'MA', 'ON', 'ORLY', 'WCC', 'TDG', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best stocks to buy that are on the rise. If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and momentum investing, then head on over to Stocks On the Rise: 5 Best To Buy Now.After a tumultuous 2022 and a strong start to 2023, investors in the stock market are currently evaluating what's ahead. The first half of this year was a surprising one for a lot of folks, as calls for a recession and the negative impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rates were widely believed to cause damage to the market. However, big tech and mega cap stocks came to the rescue, as the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and a broader economic strength evidenced by a robust labor market and GDP growth during the second quarter removed a lot of doubts about the strength or the weakness of the stock market.Looking forward, August has been the month of earnings releases. When it comes to large companies, these reports are crucial to understanding what's happening in the economy right now and what might lie ahead. Yet, even as investors look to earnings for clarity, one thing that is clear to everyone is that the rapid rate hiking cycle that shocked markets and created turmoil in short term corporate and consumer borrowing is now entering a new phase. In this phase, the question on everyone's minds is not whether the Fed will significantly raise interest rates further. Instead, the main debate right now is for how long the rates, which currently stand at 5% - 5.25% and might be raised by 0.25% later this year, will stay at these levels before the central bank decides to cut them down and stimulate economic growth without the specter of inflation hanging over its head.On this front, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) came out with a fresh note as the second week of August was ending where it speculated about the timeline of the Fed's interest rate cuts. Goldman Sachs is one of the few banks that has been increasingly doubtful of a recession in America even as others were expecting an economic downturn to hit as soon as the start of the second half of this year. Safe to say, the bank's got a couple of things right this year, and its latest take on the interest rate question suggests that the rates should stay at high levels for nearly a year from now. Goldman's note shares that a recession alone might be insufficient to force the Fed's hand, and instead, inflation will be the driving factor behind any decision to reduce interest rates.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. economist David Mericle:(By Q2 2024), we expect core PCE inflation to have fallen below 3% on a year-on-year basis and below 2.5% on a monthly annualized basis, and wage growth to have fallen below 4% year-on-year. Those thresholds for cutting align roughly with the annual forecasts in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections and the conditions at the outset of the last cutting cycle motivated by an intent to normalize from a restrictive policy stance as inflation came down in 1995.Stocks On the Rise: Best Stocks To Buy NowIn this environment, where the market is coming off of the surprising highs that it had reached by the end of July, one strategy for investing is momentum investing. As opposed to fundamentals investing, which takes a look at a firm's business operations and its financial strength to gauge the suitability of an investment decision, a momentum based strategy focuses on the current trends in the market. This involves analyzing share price trends and movements to see which stocks are rising, and looking at indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), the volume of shares being traded on the market, and the moving averages of stock prices.

UHS remains well-poised for growth on the back of solid top-line growth, strong segmental contributions and sound financial position. A strong 2023 outlook reinforces the growth prospects of the stock.Let’s delve deeper.Earnings Surprise HistoryUniversal Health boasts a solid earnings surprise record. Its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.68%.Solid 2023 OutlookUHS boasts an impressive business outlook for 2023.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) share price is up 65% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 24% (not including dividends).Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.6%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Goldman Sachs Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 21% per year. We note that the 18% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Goldman Sachs Group, it has a TSR of 77% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveGoldman Sachs Group shareholders are down 3.7% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 2.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

86,5f27b961-9353-36a1-8944-028ce6422460,GS,2023-08-16,Three things Goldman Sachs CEO Solomon can do to quiet his critics,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/three-things-goldman-sachs-ceo-165743352.html,1692118663,VIDEO,['GS'],"[New York Magazine's profile of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon (GS) was unflattering, to say the least. In a new Financial Times opinion piece, Rupak Ghose, a strategic advisor to fintech companies and banks, defends Solomon. Ghose tells Yahoo Finance Live that Goldman's performance under Solomon hasn't been that bad, noting the increase in share price and that company's risk management.There are three things Ghose says Solomon would likely quiet his critics if he did three things: First, he needs to get ""quarterly earnings motoring again."" Second, no unforced errors, such as his comments at Hamilton College. Third, he needs a ""strategic vision."" Ghose disagrees with Goldman's decision to get into consumer banking. Instead he says, the bank should be ""sticking closer to home of asset management, where they have a core DNA in alternatives, hedge funds, and private equity.""Video Transcript- Well, the name David Solomon is perhaps most synonymous with Goldman Sachs. Now if you're not the avid follower of his DJing career as DJ D-Sol, last week, The New Yorker ran a somewhat critical article of his tenure so far. Our next guest has written an opposing piece for The Financial Times, arguing that one should not get bogged down by criticism and instead look at the hard data from the bank, which has seen changes and growth under Solomon's leadership.Let's bring in fintech and bank strategic advisor Rupak Ghose. Thank you so much for joining me this morning. So, I mean, we did see New York Magazine, they didn't cut any-- you know, they weren't very soft in that op ed title, ""Is David Solomon Too Big a Jerk to Run Goldman Sachs?"" But you're basically saying perhaps they should be focusing on other aspects of the actual business themselves. Break down your base case from your op ed.RUPAK GHOSE: Sure. I think, look, in essence, I think, you know, you can't be a jerk and have bad performance, bad risk management, and bad compliance as CEO of an investment bank. But if you do have good performance, particularly very good performance, I think you can afford to be a jerk of somewhat nature.Story continuesYou can't have compliance breaches, you can't have risk management breaches. But none of the articles that have swirled around the media in the last 12, 18 months have talked about risk management or compliance breaches. And actually, the operational performance of Goldman Sachs has been very good under David Solomon. If you look at the five years he's been CEO, the share price is up almost 50%. It's up. That compares with the average bank stock that's down 20%.It's lagged Morgan Stanley. That's the Achilles heel that James Gorman is doing so well. But he's actually outperformed Jamie Dimon. You know, how many CEOs can say they've had a share price that's outperforming Jamie Dimon? And he's outperformed pretty much every major bank CEO in Europe and the US in terms of share price.Why is that? They've had book value growth of 55% to 60% in over five years. What is book value? It's essentially the profits that they generate over five years. The profits have been very, very strong. Returns have been very strong for the last five years. And market share has been very strong in its core business. Market share is really important, because, you know, the market can go up or down.A lot of retail banks are doing very well in the US because obviously rates have risen, there's a flight to deposits out of Silicon Valley, into JP Morgan, into Bank of America, and so forth. But market share Goldman has been at record levels in its fixed income business, bond trading, commodities, so forth. In equities, where they're very strong with hedge fund client base. So they are, you know, doing very well in their core businesses.Last couple of quarters have been a little bit messy, but that's partly because of the consumer business where we've obviously had some high profile issues with performance. They went into consumer. That was actually Lloyd's idea rather than David's idea. And they're unwinding that, and they're coming back closer to home where they're focusing much more on asset management as a strategic focus.I think if Solomon gets three things right, firstly gets quarterly earnings motoring again, which is key, I think. Consistently he was generating mid-teens double digit returns on equity for the last couple of years. The last couple of quarters have been mixed because of these write-downs in private equity investments because of the consumer banking unwind and so forth. But if he continues to get the market share in its core businesses and mid-teens returns, I think shareholders will like that.I think the old saying that success is a thousand fathers and failure as an orphan, I think it applies here. And that consistency with quarterly earnings is important. I think secondly, unforced errors. Whether it's going up to Hamilton College and getting misunderstood or speaking out of turn or, you know, other things he's done internally and so forth.Again, no compliance breaches and no risk management breaches so far. But generally, no unforced errors is, I think, the second thing that's really important. And I think the third thing is a strategic vision. I think the move into consumer was incorrect. Goldman as sort of barbarians at the gate thought they could go anywhere, and consumer was an area they failed in. But sticking closer to home with asset management.Where they have a core DNA in alternatives and hedge funds and private equity I think is a focus. And really growing that business so they can expand their multiple. The way that we analyze bank stocks is a price to book value. And the price to book value of Morgan Stanley has risen significantly as James Gorman has moved that business out of more volatile investment banking into more recurring wealth management. And Solomon has to achieve that over a number of years.- And so then at the end of the day, I mean, does it even matter then when you compare, you know, your Gorman, your Dimon and Solomon together and their leadership styles, if when you actually look at the financial performance, Goldman is still in a very good place. And also, what would the succession plan even look like? Is there even a clear line of succession for David Solomon?RUPAK GHOSE: Yeah. I think the performance of the business has been strong under him. It's not-- they haven't had that strategic expansion they needed to do. But he's had some headwinds in terms of the investment banking business and so forth. And I think if you take Gorman out of the equation, I think he's probably done as well as anyone in the last couple of years.And many of the Gorman decisions were done over a decade. And I think your point about succession is very important. And also, I think we look at CEOs that have passed and people of the past often through rose-tinted eyes in terms of if you look at the history of his predecessor as CEO, you know, they lost a lot of market share in fixed income post the financial crisis whereas the Dodd-Frank rules bit. They had some massive scandals with Malaysia in terms of the sovereign wealth fund there and some massive fines.So they've had some issues in the past. Previous Goldman CEOs have had issues, whether it's Jon Corzine with MF Global, or Bob Rubin at Citigroup and so forth. So there is an obvious bench here of people. And I think you're showing a chart of partners leaving. The fact is that Goldman partners are phenomenally well paid. That's why they have very strong views and so forth. And they are very well connected, and people want to hire them on the street.But I don't think the turnover at Goldman at senior levels has been materially higher than under previous regimes. I think it's a sort of clickbait that obviously at the moment, it's great to highlight those departures. And look, it's not normal to have that many partners speaking out in New York Magazine in that much detail. But I do think there is an issue with succession here. Who would be the obvious successor?Everyone talks about Waldron, but, you know, he's close to Solomon. There isn't an obvious successor there. People talk about Blankfein coming back. But again, I would question his legacy, whether it's 1MBD in Malaysia, whether it's the FICC market share losses that he had, the strategic vision that he had. There was really limited strategic change under his reign.- And it certainly does seem that, I mean, people-- at least investors aren't as worried about how the sausage is being made, and they are focusing on that financial data. A big thank you there to fintech and bank strategic advisor Rupak Ghose. Really fascinating conversation there. Thank you for your time this morning.RUPAK GHOSE: Thank you so much.]"

Earnings of MTG have risen 16% over the last five years, better than the industry average of 5.9%.MTG has a solid surprise history. It surpassed estimates in the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 23.59%.This largest private mortgage insurer in the United States has been witnessing an increase in new business written. The insurer expects new business, combined with increasing annual persistency, to result in continued growth of the insurance-in-force portfolio.MTG has been witnessing a declining pattern of claim filings. Thus, we expect paid claims to decrease further. A decline in loss and claims will strengthen the balance sheet and hence improve its financial profile.Banking on capital contribution, reinsurance transaction and cash position, MTG has been improving its capital position. Both leverage and times interest earned ratio have been improving.Riding on a solid capital position, the mortgage insurer returned approximately $209.5 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchases and dividends in the first half of 2023. The board of directors approved an additional share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of an additional $500 million worth of shares through Jul 1, 2025.However, the insurer has been witnessing an increase in underwriting and other expenses weighing on margins. The loss ratio was negative 2.5% in the first half of 2023. MTG expects operating expenses in 2023 in the range of $235 million to $245 million.Nonetheless, MTG’s trailing 12-month return on equity was 17.3%, ahead of the industry average of 12.4%.

Improving travel and warranty operations are likely to drive AIG’s personal lines insurance business. Strategic business de-risking and acquisitions, cost-control efforts and accelerated capital deployment will drive American International’s growth.Assurant’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 24.39%.Increased mobile subscribers in North America, inorganic and organic growth strategies, higher average insured values and effective capital deployment bode well for the growth. For 2023, AIZ expects to grow adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase by high single-digits and adjusted EPS growth to approximate adjusted EBITDA growth.

""Gold Rush"": Focus on 3 Stocks Selling the ""Picks""The AI Arms RaceOpenAI and Microsoft’s AI “Chatbot” ChatGPT shocked the world in late 2022 with its capability, speed, and user growth. Less than a week after launching, ChatGPT reached a billion users, reaching the milestone well before previous consumer application record holders like Instagram (took more than two months) and Netflix (took 3.5 years). A few months after ChatGPT went mainstream, Googlelaunched its Chatbot named Bard.Competition Heating upLike the internet boom of the late 1990s, innovators nationwide are beginning to understand how transformative and potentially profitable the technology can be. Today, we know that Google beat out Yahoo! and others in the search engine wars. However, before these juggernauts became dominant in their respective spaces, it was unclear who would win out of the thousands of competitors who ultimately made it. While ChatGPT is the early leader, the race has just begun. Despite the tough competition, the rewards are perceived to be enough such that innovators worldwide are racing for AI supremacy.Why Search for “Gold” When you can Sell the “Picks”?Investors looking to cash in on the AI revolution have two choices: bet on a company they think can win the AI race, or bet on the companies that are necessary to run AI. In my mind, the odds favor the latter. Below are 3 such companies that are buyable now:Semiconductors Will Power AIZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the obvious choice. Nvidia is the market leader in high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, computing, and accelerated computing.4 Billion Reasons to BuyLast quarter, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by upping quarterly revenue guidance to $11 billion after announcing revenue of $7 billion. Wall Street is catching up – for the current year, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest NVDA will grow eps at a cool 133.23%Story continuesGlobal AdoptionWhat analysts may not foresee is the global adoption taking place. China’s internet giants want to buy $5 billion worth of high-performance Nvidia chips used in generative AI. The buying mania comes as tensions between the US and China hit a fever pitch.Quantum Computing Will Lead to Cost SavingsIonq is the only pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock. The company’s website says, “The dawn of the quantum age is here. IonQ is developing quantum computers designed to solve the world’s most complex problems and transform business, societies, and the planet for the better.”AI Isn’t CheapDid you know it costs about $100 thousand daily to run ChatGPT? Meanwhile, Google’s Bard Chatbot costs about ten times more than a standard Google keyword search. As AI grows in popularity, these costs will only increase. Quantum computing companies like IonQ are a potential solution. IonQ can help companies like Google run the large language models (LLMs) necessary for generative AI at a fraction of the cost.Investors are noticing the potential. Year-to-date, IonQ shares are up 348%. However, in the past few weeks, the stock has finally retreated to the 50-day moving average, offering investors another chance to get on board.IonQ is just getting started. Like anything in economics, supply and demand forces are critical for determining future prices. Because IonQ has a tiny share float (# of shares available for trading by the public) of ~159 million shares, continued positive news may send shares even higher.AI Will Drive Cloud &amp; Database GrowthZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Stock Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Benefitting from the AI RevolutionOracle is likely to continue to grow rapidly due to the AI revolution. The company offers AI-driven solutions and tools to help businesses integrate machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into their applications and processes – something almost every big tech company is rushing to do.13F Shows Smart Money is Entering the StockLegendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller has famously never had a down year in more than 30 years of investing. Druckenmiller’s 13F disclosure shows that ORCL is a new buy for him. Steady MoverDespite Oracle’s massive size, it is talked about less than stocks such as Microsoft and Amazon.Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are an investor's dream.Technical BreakoutOracle is breaking out of a classic bull wedge today. Furthermore, while the Nasdaq is deep in the red, ORCL is green and is exhibiting relative strength – a bullish sign.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Broadcast and cable each hit a new low of 20% and 29.6% of total TV usage, respectively, to combine for a linear television total of 49.6%.Time spent streaming (via a television) increased 2.9% in July compared with June, according to the data, to reach a record of 38.7% of total TV usage. YouTube (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) all saw month-over-month viewership increases of 5.6%, 4.2%, and 5%, respectively, in July.""Linear TV [is] past the point of no return,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients on Monday, adding the revenue line for cable and satellite operators is ""probably permanently negative"" as pricing fails to drive upside while TV advertising growth stalls.""We think the metrics for linear TV are all bad,"" the analyst continued. ""Ad revenue across our media network coverage fell 13% on average in Q2, down from -8% in 1Q, which included the Super Bowl. We forecast the second half of the year will get slightly better, but to remain negative including an off-political year comparison.""The data comes as more consumers drop their cable packages in a trend known as cord-cutting and instead opt for streaming services that are traditionally less profitable for media companies.Still, streaming is not exactly outperforming either, Nollen warned, explaining subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined.""Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time,"" he wrote, adding the growth was aided by Netflix's password-sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.Story continuesComcast's Peacock (CMCSA) was able to grow its subscriber base 84% year-over-year to 24 million, up from the prior 13 million, as the streamer works to catch up to its peers amid a significant lag.""June 26 was the last day for Xfinity subscribers to get Peacock for free,"" Nollen noted, citing that deadline as a likely catalyst for the subscriber additions. ""This pricing trend follows Disney's collective price hikes, with Hulu soon to be the most expensive ad free platform at $17.99. As land grabs for subscribers have slowed, companies have turned to pricing increases to fuel revenue growth.""Another area that's fueling revenue growth? Direct-to-consumer advertising, which grew 27% on average across media companies including Disney (DIS), Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA). That's double from the 13% growth posted in the first quarter.Nollen said Comcast is the farthest behind, as only 14% of its estimated revenues are expected to come from DTC in 2024 with the other 85% stemming from its linear networks. Disney is the farthest along, with DTC revenue expected to surpass linear network revenue for the first time in 2024.Disney CEO Bob Iger.

Maxx and Homesense stores, as well as tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at.MarginsFor the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company’s pretax profit margin was 10.4%, well above the Company’s plan and 1.2 percentage points above last year’s second quarter pretax profit margin of 9.2%. The Company’s above-plan pretax profit margin was driven by a better-than-expected benefit from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on the Company’s above-plan sales.Gross profit margin for the second quarter of Fiscal 2024 was 30.2%, a 2.6 percentage point increase versus the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin due to a significant benefit from lower freight costs.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales for the second quarter of Fiscal 2024 were 20.1%, a 1.7 percentage point increase versus the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals, a reserve related to a German government COVID program receivable, incremental store wage and payroll costs, and a contribution to the TJX Foundation.Net interest income benefitted second quarter Fiscal 2024 pretax profit margin by 0.4 percentage points versus the prior year.Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates. Given the global operations of the Company, to facilitate comparability, the Company has provided sales growth and inventory on a constant currency basis, which assumes a constant exchange rate between periods for translation based on the rate in effect for the prior period.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 negative impact on second quarter Fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the first half of Fiscal 2024 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 negative impact on the first half of Fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share.A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX’s net sales, pretax earnings, and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of TJX.com.The foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as ""transactional foreign exchange.""InventoryTotal inventories as of July 29, 2023 were $6.6 billion, compared to $7.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of Fiscal 2023. Last year, the Company’s total inventories in the second quarter reflected the early arrival of merchandise and a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of July 29, 2023, including distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit, the Company’s e-commerce sites, and Sierra stores, were down 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Constant currency basis reflects inventory adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, if any, as described above. The Company is well-positioned to take advantage of a marketplace that is loaded with outstanding quality, branded merchandise and is in a great position to flow exciting merchandise to its stores and online throughout the fall and holiday shopping seasons.Cash and Shareholder DistributionsFor the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company paid down $500 million of maturing debt.During the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company returned $932 million to shareholders. The Company repurchased a total of $550 million of TJX stock, retiring 6.7 million shares, and paid $382 million in shareholder dividends during the quarter. During the first half of Fiscal 2024, the Company returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, which includes repurchasing a total of $1.05 billion of TJX stock, retiring 13.2 million shares, and paying $723 million in shareholder dividends.The Company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $2.0 to $2.5 billion of TJX stock during the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024. The Company may adjust this amount up or down depending on various factors. The Company remains committed to returning cash to its shareholders while continuing to invest in the business to support the near- and long-term growth of TJX.Pension Payout OfferThe Company has offered eligible, former TJX Associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit an opportunity to receive a voluntary lump sum payout of their vested pension plan benefit. As a result, the Company anticipates a non-cash settlement charge, which may negatively impact Fiscal 2024 earnings per share by approximately $.01 to $.02. Any actual settlement charge may be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. This potential non-cash settlement charge is expected to be incurred in the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 and would impact the Company’s pretax profit margin and earnings per share results. The potential impact of this pension payout offer is not included in the Company’s Fiscal 2024 outlook below. The Company expects to exclude the impact of this potential charge from the Company’s third quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin and adjusted earnings per share results.Third Quarter, Fourth Quarter, and Full Year Fiscal 2024 OutlookFor the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company is planning overall comparable store sales to be up 3% to 4%, pretax profit margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%, and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.95 to $.98.For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company is now planning overall comparable store sales to be up 3% to 4%. For the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company is increasing its expectations for pretax profit margin to a range of 10.7% to 10.8% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.66 to $3.72. The Company’s full-year guidance includes an expected pretax profit margin benefit of approximately 0.1 percentage point and a diluted earnings per share benefit of approximately $.10 due to the 53rd week in the Company’s Fiscal 2024 calendar. Excluding these expected benefits, the Company now expects full-year Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62.Based on the Company’s third quarter and full-year Fiscal 2024 outlook, the Company is planning fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 overall comparable store sales to be up 3% to 4%, pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.9% and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.13. The Company’s fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 outlook includes an expected pretax profit margin benefit of approximately 0.4 percentage points and a diluted earnings per share benefit of approximately $.10 due to the extra week in the Company’s fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 calendar. Excluding these expected benefits, the Company is planning fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.03.Stores by ConceptDuring the second quarter ended July 29, 2023, the Company increased its store count by 19 stores to a total of 4,884 stores and increased square footage by 0.3% versus the prior quarter.Store Locations1Gross Square Feet2Second Quarter FY2024Second Quarter FY2024(in millions)BeginningEndBeginningEndIn the U.S.:T.J.

However, while stores in the U.S. were open for all of Fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International (Europe and Australia) experienced COVID-related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during Fiscal 2022. Therefore, in Fiscal 2023, the Company could not measure year-over-year comparable store sales with Fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the Fiscal 2023 measure consisted of U.S. stores only, which, for clarity, the Company referred to as U.S. comparable store sales and were calculated against sales for the comparable periods in Fiscal 2022. For Fiscal 2022, due to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company reported open-only comparable store sales. This measure reported the sales increase or decrease of stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of Fiscal 2021 for the days they were open in Fiscal 2022 against sales of those stores for the same days in Fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales for a category such as home or apparel include sales from merchandise within such category combined across all divisions at the stores that fall within the Company’s definition of comparable stores for such period.About The TJX Companies, Inc.The TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. As of July 29, 2023, the end of the Company’s second quarter, the Company operated a total of 4,884 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and seven e-commerce sites. These include 1,305 T.J.

Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted to exclude or include, as applicable, from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), items identified in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release include sales growth on a constant currency basis, inventory on a constant currency basis, adjusted pretax profit margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes, to consider underlying trends of its business, and in measuring its performance relative to others in the market, and believes presenting these measures also provides information to investors and others for understanding and evaluating trends in the Company’s operating results or measuring performance in the same manner as the Company’s management. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

During the six months ended July 29, 2023, the Company returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing and retiring 13.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.05 billion on a ""trade date"" basis and paying $0.7 billion in shareholder dividends. In February 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. Under this program and a previously announced program, TJX had approximately $2.5 billion available for repurchase as of July 29, 2023. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.During Fiscal 2023, the Company announced and completed the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $218 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 representing the entire carrying value of the investment. This charge had a $0.19 negative impact on diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Subsequently, the Company realized a $54 million tax benefit when the Company completed the divestiture of this investment during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. Together, these resulted in a net $0.14 negative impact on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815811438/en/ContactsThe TJX Companies, Inc.Debra McConnellGlobal Communications(508) 390-2323]"

With Home Depot able to surpass top and bottom line expectations Ross Stores ROST and TJX Companies TJX are two retailers to watch as well. This is especially true with the back-to-school shopping season upon us. Keeping this scenario in mind, now may be a good time to buy TJX and Ross stock as their Q2 reports approach on August 16 and 17 respectively.TJX Q2 Preview: As a global leader among off-price apparel retailers, TJX’s Q2 report could bring good news to investors’ ears.TJX’s Q2 earnings are expected to be up 10% at $0.76 per share with sales anticipated to rise 5% to $12.41 billion. Notably, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) has TJX beating earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $0.78 and 2% above the Zacks Consensus.There would be no surprise if TJX accompanies its Q2 results with favorable guidance as the company’s top and bottom lines are expected to expand 6% and 10% during the third-quarter respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss Q2 Preview: Ross Stores has carved out its own niche as an off price-retailer of clothing and other apparel and the company's outlook has strengthened as back-to-school shopping begins.While the third-quarter should be a particularly strong period for Ross, respectable growth is expected in the company’s Q2 results on Thursday as well. Earnings are expected to rise 4% at $1.16 per share with Q2 sales projected to be up 3% to $4.73 billion. Plus, the Zacks ESP also indicates Ross could surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $1.19 and 2% above the Zacks Consensus.Looking ahead there is a strong chance Ross will be able to offer favorable guidance with the company projected to have 15% earnings growth during Q3 and its top line forecasted to expand 2% from the prior-year quarter.

Earlier this year, the company announced the end of a series of FDA applications for sickle cell treatments. The submission marks a significant milestone for CRISPR as, in the words of the company’s chief medical officer, “within a decade, we have progressed from the discovery of the CRISPR platform to the first regulatory filings for a CRISPR-based therapy, which speaks to the transformative nature of CRISPR technology.”While gene editing and CRISPR technology doubtlessly have a long road ahead, its first-mover advantage and institutional investor interest should prove beneficial as the company creates the future of healthcare today.Amgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) saw two cancer drugs break through clinical study barriers this week. Clinical studies are long and arduous processes with a massive attrition rate over time. Any news of therapeutics advancing to the next round is good, and two at a time is even better.Story continuesSupplementing Amgen’s recent win is a decent bench of revenue-producing products that help offset expensive research and development (R&amp;D) costs. On August 3rd, the company saw another round of great news as it beat earnings estimates on the back of those product offerings. Revenue jumped 8% over the quarter, and much of that growth came from a 29% sales increase for the company’s flagship drug Amjevita.The biotech company also enjoys global diversification, with 46% of net revenue coming from Asian-Pacific markets. Global exposure is critical for biotech companies to penetrate as many viable markets as possible, and Amgen’s proven its worldwide popularity.Gilead Sciences (GILD)A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) appears highly undervalued in today’s market, and recent HIV drug wins might prove to be the tailwind propelling the biotech company back into fair valuation territory.A recent quantitative analysis report indicates Gilead might be as much as 40% undervalued, with a $132 price target. At the same time, broad market consensus affirms the bullish outlook, albeit with a broad $100 price target.Gilead remains one of the most agile of the large biotech companies, and the company’s profit margins for HIV and hepatitis C treatments are massive due to cheap manufacturing costs and dominance in physician protocols. The company also enjoys broad patent protection on its HIV therapeutic portfolio, asserting its position amid generic manufacturers and competitors.Gilead may not have seen some of the breaking news wins as the other biotech companies in this article. Still, they remain a steady and consistent winner — albeit one substantially undervalued in August.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

110,711fc482-6047-3a76-8af6-ecce7418598d,M,2023-08-16,Analysts Estimate Macy's (M) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-macys-m-report-190253274.html,1692126173,STORY,['M'],"[Macy's (M) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 22, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -87%.Revenues are expected to be $5.05 billion, down 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Macy's?For Macy's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +30.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Macy's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Macy's would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of +21.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Macy's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith examines the U.S. companies that have the most exposure to Chinese markets and consumers, including Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Starbucks (SBUX), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), L.V. Sands (LVS), and MGM Resorts (MGM).Video Transcript- The economic slowdown in China could send shockwaves into corporate America. Brad Smith is here with a closer look at some of the companies that could be hit because of their exposure to China. What do you have?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, so it's really interesting to track some of the data that has come out that has disappointed to this far. You think about some of the economic growth data that has really been lackluster to this point in time, especially in comparison to a lot of the reopening trade that, once again, recommenced but in a different nation.In China, the second largest GDP or second largest economy by GDP in the world here. And that ensues an issue because you had a lot of the hopes of investors and among regulators in China hoping that bounce back would move forward here. So just a few data points here, let's throw out real quick.The economic data in July, particularly here, you think about some of the Industrial output failing to meet expectations. In retail sales, failing to meet expectations. And then additionally here, this really pushed forward that larger concern for where growth would actually come in.If you ask Barclays who came out this morning and cut their own GDP growth forecast to 4 and 1/2% for China, that mirrors some of what we had already heard across the street and particularly, how investors are having to continue to think about this.So two ways that I want to really break this down and one of them stems from what we still have yet to see and how one of our guests earlier had classified what is taking place in China right now. And for that, let me bring in Exante Data founder and CEO, Jens Nordvig who had this to say earlier on.Story continuesJENS NORDVIG: When I look at the data in China-- I've been covering China for about 20 years, I've never seen this type of weakness where it feels like you have a real confidence issue where the consumer is starting to get extremely nervous, worried about the future, and holding back.And it was difficult to see it very clearly in the data, right? Because we had that bounce because of the reopening but under the surface, we have a confidence issue that is very severe and that's certainly going to have spillovers into stock markets around the world.BRAD SMITH: And so with that spillover, here's where it becomes interesting is what is the actual policy that is going to be enacted in order to generate that demand? Well it's kind of similar to what we've seen here in the US.You think about how the Fed has needed to take certain activities to ensure that people are dampening down on their amount of spending? Well, it's the opposite. What does stimulus look like in China and that moving forward to try and spur spending? China's central bank, they've moved their lending and repurchase rates lower, putting those-- and particularly slashing those as the second largest economy is trying to reverse the course of its slowdown here.And then additionally when you think about that policy vacuum, he actually-- Nordvig went on to say during that conversation, we are in a policy vacuum where there seems to be some internal disagreement about what should be the policy from here and that's creating a lag and delay and that is making markets very, very uncomfortable.Now, if you're thinking about the equity markets in some of the players that could be most notably impact, look to some of the US publicly traded companies that have the most exposure to China. Let's look at it from two frames of mind here. Tesla, Apple, Starbucks, you're seeing them on their screen.Far different companies. But still one that relies heavily on these spending propensity from the consumer in China as they've all got growth ambitions whether technologically in Apple's kind of handset or smartphone realm and trying to make sure that they're taking on more market share or even in the highly competitive automotive landscape where Tesla has continued to build up its ambitions both for manufacturing and selling in China.And then additionally, you mentioned Starbucks. Some people just need to have a good cup of coffee sometimes and that's in China too. Also here, just lastly before I leave you, if the consumer is not spending as much on physical goods, are they spending into services?That's a big question or is that service gambling? Now this is something where it could be interesting and I've been taking a look at shares of these major gambling houses or wagering houses, betting houses, however you want to look at it.It's a Casino operator, folks. Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, all of these companies who have some type of experience that they have either built out in China in Macau or tried to cozy up to the potential gambling society or gamblers that are placing their wagers in one way or another. So if you're not spending on physical goods, maybe you're spending into services but are you wagering your money? And that's a big question and some investors would say, heck no.- Yeah. I don't know. The outlook for a number of those casino operators that have heavy exposure to China and also some of those retailers that do a lot of business in China certainly headwinds at least in the short term there for those companies. All right, Brad. Thanks.]"

116,e583609f-fbce-347a-8a78-8d469da58753,NEE,2023-08-16,7 Dividend Aristocrats That Have Raised Their Payouts for 25 Years or More,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-aristocrats-raised-payouts-210510319.html,1691615110,STORY,"['ITW', 'NEE', '^GSPC', 'ALB', 'CAH', 'ADP']","[In recent years, dividend aristocrats have become a popular choice among investors of all stripes. Dividend aristocrats, or S&amp;P 500 index components with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, have historically delivered total returns on par with the S&amp;P 500 but with lower volatility.If you want to invest in all the stocks in this category, it’s pretty easy. All you need to do is buy the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BATS:NOBL), which owns all 67 of these “aristocrats” in near-equal amounts.However, if you want to target even more substantial long-term total returns, selecting some of the highest-potential dividend aristocrat stocks may also be worth looking into.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor instance, the seven dividend aristocrats listed below offer a solid mix of growth, value, and yield, making them strong candidates for your portfolio, whether your investing strategy is focused more on income or capital growth.Automatic Data Processing (ADP)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockIf yield and growth are your investing objectives, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the top dividend stocks to buy. As you likely know, ADP is a leading payroll provider and related services to businesses.With this steady, recession-resistant underlying business, it is no surprise that ADP stock has historically produced strong total returns for investors. Although past performance does not indicate future returns, as I argued last spring, this stock has a solid chance to continue producing above-average total returns.Taking another look at the numbers, I reiterate this view. Sell-side forecasts call for earnings growth of around 10% in the coming years. Assuming shares keep climbing in tandem with earnings growth, coupled with the stock’s 2.03% forward dividend (which has grown by an average of 13.7% annually for the past five years), double-digit returns are likely within reach.Story continuesAlbemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comIf capital growth is your focus, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a dividend aristocrat to consider. Shares in this specialty chemicals company have one of the dividend aristocrats’ lowest forward yields (0.8%). Dividend growth over the past five years (averaging 3.95% annually) has also been modest.However, due to the stock’s strong growth catalyst, this relatively low yield is more than made up for. Albemarle has high exposure to the current “lithium boom,” fueled by the auto industry’s big pivot towards producing electric vehicles (or EVs). Admittedly, a strong pullback in lithium prices has recently lowered ALB stock.Yet based on the company’s latest quarterly results and guidance, it’s clear that demand and prices for lithium remain likely to keep rising. This points to more earnings growth, dividend growth, and higher prices ahead for ALB shares.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) may be a more appealing choice for value-conscious investors. Shares in the healthcare distributor trade at a forward price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio of around 16. This is slightly below the average P/E ratio (18.5) for the basket of dividend aristocrat names included in the NOBL portfolio.While cheaper than average, CAH stock has a forward dividend yield (2.19%). That’s only slightly above the average yield among the aristocrats (1.89%). Dividend growth has also been lackluster in the past five years, averaging just 1.3% annually.Still, with the prospect of double-digit earnings growth in the coming years (boosted by plans to repurchase up to $3.5 billion worth of shares), CAH (up by 51.5% over the past year) could keep rising due to increased earnings and perhaps, due a possible further expansion of its forward multiple.Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browserSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is another of the dividend aristocrats with many years of dividend and earnings growth under its belt that is likely to continue delivering a similar level of performance.The industrial conglomerate continues to increase its rate of payout steadily. Just last week, ITW raised its dividend by 7%. With this, ITW stock now has a forward annual dividend yield of 2.12%. While the current economic slowdown is expected to affect earnings this year, long-term earnings prospects for Illinois Tool Works remain promising.Analyst forecasts call for 6% earnings growth in 2024 and more than 7% in 2025. This level of growth, plus ITW’s high-quality reputation, is likely sufficient for shares to maintain their forward multiple of around 25.3. Between shares rising in tandem with this earnings growth, plus the steady, growing dividend, ITW could continue producing solid total returns.Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comNot only does Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) hold dividend aristocrat status. The home improvement retailer also holds dividend king status, with its more than 50-year track record of dividend growth.That’s not the only thing that makes this stock appealing. LOW stock trades for around 16.7 times forward earnings. Lowes’ main rival, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), trades at a much higher valuation (21.8 times earnings). This big gap exists, despite Lowe’s having a higher level of expected earnings growth.There may be doubts LOW can deliver such earnings growth, yet I believe it is attainable, primarily because of how aggressively the company is buying back shares. This will help to boost earnings per share. Delivering this level of growth may help bridge this valuation gap. Alongside returns stemming from LOW’s 1.97% dividend, this could mean strong returns ahead for investors buying the stock today.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comRising interest rates have knocked utilities stocks lower, and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is no exception. However, suppose you’ve been looking to make this one of the dividend aristocrats in your portfolio. In that case, NEE’s selloff works to your advantage, and not only because interest rates aren’t set to stay high forever.Due to NextEra’s higher exposure to the clean energy revolution than other utilities, NEE stock has long commanded a premium valuation. Yet with NEE’s pullback in price, you can buy it today for 22.2 times forward earnings. This may be a low valuation compared to the company’s growth potential.As InvestorPlace’s John Blakenhorn recently argued, NextEra’s efforts in renewable energy and battery storage will likely continue to drive earnings growth. This points to further growth of NEE’s dividend (forward yield today of 2.7%) and solid price appreciation over a long time frame.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockPaying out dividends monthly since its founding 54 years ago, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has been one of the most consistent dividend stocks. Real estate investment trusts (or REITs), like utilities, have also been hammered by rising interest rates, but again, this may make now a great time to initiate a position in this stock.Thus, buy O stock today and lock down a 5.18% dividend yield. While Realty Income has a long dividend track record, dividend growth hasn’t been exceptionally high (averaging around 3.73% annually) over the past five years.Even so, don’t assume disappointing returns lie ahead for O shares. Besides a 5.18% (and gradually growing) yield, there’s also a strong chance this REIT will experience a big rebound in price once interest rates normalize. Considering this, snapping up O today could prove to be a profitable move in hindsight.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceThe #1 AI Name for 2023 Could Be About to Ignite This $20.6 Trillion Wealth ShiftMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The company also announced the receipt of the CE mark for label expansion of the HFX SCS (spinal cord simulator) system to include painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) and non-surgical back pain. These developments are likely to boost healthcare system efficiencies, patient access to remote optimization, and unique labeling for outcomes beyond pain relief.The newly-launched HFX Connect has 35 pre-programmed customizable treatment plans. The HFX Connect therapy will be available to new and existing patients on Nevro’s Omnia platform.With HFX Connect, pain specialists are likely to be able to offer patients the most flexible SCS therapy that suits their individual needs. Moreover, the improved remote adjustment features of HFX Connect can help me save time and money by reducing the need for manual programming and frequent hospital visits. This can also benefit the healthcare systems that are facing resource constraints.Following the latest regulatory developments, HFX is the only SCS therapy globally with CE mark approval for improving sensation and relieving pain in PDN patients. This new specific labelling covers all primary SCS indications, such as Pain in the Back and Leg, Back Pain without Surgery, Diabetic Nerve Pain, and Pain in the Neck and Upper Limb.The HFX Connect is already available in the United States and Australia.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $2032.5 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $3070 million by 2027 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch and label expansion is expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business.Notable DevelopmentsEarlier this month, Nevro announced its second-quarter 2023 results, where it saw a solid improvement in top-line results. The company’s robust domestic and international revenues were also impressive. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was promising. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures was also encouraging.Story continuesIn June, Nevro announced favorable SENZA-PDN Randomized Controlled Trial data at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, which demonstrated a positive correlation between the use of high-frequency (10 kHz) Spinal Cord Stimulation and reductions in HbA1c and body weight in a sub-group of patients with type 2 diabetes at 24 months.During the second quarter, Nevro also won two significant payer coverages — Florida Blue (updated their medical policy to include coverage for PDN, effective Jun 15, 2023) and Medicare Administrative Contractors Novitas and First Coast Service Options (who now covers PDN and Non-Surgical Back Pain following the Medicare National Coverage Determination, effective Jul 13, 2023).

120,0ca51234-e22f-3817-ba8b-cafc0f0dcff9,MAS,2023-08-16,Digital Initiatives Aid Armstrong World (AWI) Amid High Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/digital-initiatives-aid-armstrong-world-155000983.html,1692114600,STORY,"['AWI', 'OC', 'MAS', 'RPM']","[Armstrong World Industries, Inc. AWI has been witnessing solid sales growth in the Health Zone product line through its online marketplace.  Also, its focus on digital initiatives, investment in new products and inorganic moves bodes well. However, higher raw material costs and Fed’s consistent rate hikes are concerns.Driving FactorsThe company is continuously investing in healthy spaces and digital initiatives and is optimistic about its contribution to its growth. During second-quarter 2023, AWI's healthy spaces and digital growth strategies positively contributed to Mineral Fiber sales. Strong sales growth in the Health Zone product line through its online marketplace helped the company mitigate some of the adverse effects of the overall decline in market activity. Notably, sales through its digital initiative, Canopy have surpassed the total sales for 2022.Armstrong World has been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services and advanced manufacturing capabilities. The company’s Architectural Specialties segment has been leveraging the new product platforms it has acquired in the past several years. This has helped the company further penetrate the specialty ceiling and wall category, participating in more spaces and commercial buildings and, importantly, larger, more complex jobs.The company's systematic inorganic strategy enhanced its portfolio over the past few years. During second-quarter 2023, Armstrong World secured contracts at the Seattle-Tacoma airport and the airport in El Paso. The company is tracking over 200 airport projects, including new terminals at JFK in New York and Chicago's O'Hare, projects in Nashville, Orlando, Jacksonville and others.In July 2023, Armstrong acquired BOK Modern, LLC, to further enhance its portfolio. The company intends to leverage BOK's third-party network and potentially integrate some operations into existing factories for a more efficient supply chain and improved capacity to support rapid expansion.Story continuesHeadwindsAWI is highly dependent on housing market demand. The company, which shares space with RPM International Inc. RPM, Owens Corning OC, Masco Corporation MAS have been experiencing lower demand due to prevailing market conditions. The cyclical housing industry makes it vulnerable to changes in consumer confidence and economic conditions. As the Fed tightens monetary policy to curb inflation, higher mortgage rates may lead to reduced consumer spending on construction and renovation projects. This, in turn, could dampen demand for the company's ceiling systems, particularly in the U.S. market, where the effects of rising interest rates are already noticeable.This apart, it has been investing regularly in healthy spaces and digitization, which is ultimately increasing selling, general and administrative or SG&amp;A expenses. The company's SG&amp;A expenses in the first half of 2023 were $124.6 million, up 5.1% compared with $118.6 million in the year-ago period. The increase in SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to an $8 million increase in selling expenses, primarily related to digital initiatives and higher costs in the Architectural Specialties segment.Higher raw material, energy and freight costs and manufacturing costs hurt the company's bottom line. Although the company has been working to recover higher commodity costs through price increases, we expect this ongoing volatility in material costs to continue in the near term.A Brief Review of the Other PlayersRPM International: The company is benefiting from its businesses, providing engineered solutions targeting infrastructure and reshoring projects. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the Performance Coatings Group segment sales increased 8.8% year over year to $358.4 million. Also, implementation of MAP 2025 operational improvement initiative, increased infrastructure spending, strategic buyouts and divestitures added to growth.Owens Corning: The company is benefiting from solid Roofing segment performance. In second quarter 2023, the segment’s sales increased 10% year over year to $1.1 billion. The upside was driven by higher volumes related to storm activity and positive price realization. Also, its focus on pricing initiatives and product innovation bodes well.Masco: The company is benefiting from Strong pricing actions and operational efficiency. Also, solid liquidity level, cost-saving efforts and accretive acquisitions are encouraging. In second quarter 2023, adjusted gross margin improved 320 bps from the prior-year level to 36.2%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and momentum investing, then head on over to Stocks On the Rise: 5 Best To Buy Now.After a tumultuous 2022 and a strong start to 2023, investors in the stock market are currently evaluating what's ahead. The first half of this year was a surprising one for a lot of folks, as calls for a recession and the negative impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rates were widely believed to cause damage to the market. However, big tech and mega cap stocks came to the rescue, as the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and a broader economic strength evidenced by a robust labor market and GDP growth during the second quarter removed a lot of doubts about the strength or the weakness of the stock market.Looking forward, August has been the month of earnings releases. When it comes to large companies, these reports are crucial to understanding what's happening in the economy right now and what might lie ahead. Yet, even as investors look to earnings for clarity, one thing that is clear to everyone is that the rapid rate hiking cycle that shocked markets and created turmoil in short term corporate and consumer borrowing is now entering a new phase. In this phase, the question on everyone's minds is not whether the Fed will significantly raise interest rates further. Instead, the main debate right now is for how long the rates, which currently stand at 5% - 5.25% and might be raised by 0.25% later this year, will stay at these levels before the central bank decides to cut them down and stimulate economic growth without the specter of inflation hanging over its head.On this front, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) came out with a fresh note as the second week of August was ending where it speculated about the timeline of the Fed's interest rate cuts. Goldman Sachs is one of the few banks that has been increasingly doubtful of a recession in America even as others were expecting an economic downturn to hit as soon as the start of the second half of this year. Safe to say, the bank's got a couple of things right this year, and its latest take on the interest rate question suggests that the rates should stay at high levels for nearly a year from now. Goldman's note shares that a recession alone might be insufficient to force the Fed's hand, and instead, inflation will be the driving factor behind any decision to reduce interest rates.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. economist David Mericle:(By Q2 2024), we expect core PCE inflation to have fallen below 3% on a year-on-year basis and below 2.5% on a monthly annualized basis, and wage growth to have fallen below 4% year-on-year. Those thresholds for cutting align roughly with the annual forecasts in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections and the conditions at the outset of the last cutting cycle motivated by an intent to normalize from a restrictive policy stance as inflation came down in 1995.Stocks On the Rise: Best Stocks To Buy NowIn this environment, where the market is coming off of the surprising highs that it had reached by the end of July, one strategy for investing is momentum investing. As opposed to fundamentals investing, which takes a look at a firm's business operations and its financial strength to gauge the suitability of an investment decision, a momentum based strategy focuses on the current trends in the market. This involves analyzing share price trends and movements to see which stocks are rising, and looking at indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), the volume of shares being traded on the market, and the moving averages of stock prices.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the QUALCOMM share price has climbed 72% in five years, easily topping the market return of 49% (ignoring dividends).In light of the stock dropping 4.5% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, QUALCOMM moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. We can see that the QUALCOMM share price is up 1.6% in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 48% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 0.5% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on QUALCOMM's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, QUALCOMM's TSR for the last 5 years was 97%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in QUALCOMM had a tough year, with a total loss of 23% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.1%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

BellGreat. Thank you, Jon, and thank you to everyone for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's start with an update on our largest program. The $2.4 billion contract with Rivada Space Networks. I am pleased to report we are steadily ramping up the program. Our team is currently executing on the design phase of the program, which represents $460 million of the $2.4 billion contract. This portion of the contracts kicked off in earnest in July with our successful completion of the first milestone, the system requirements review. The system requirements review defines the design and system requirements for the space and ground elements. Then the next significant milestone, the preliminary design review, or PDR, is planned for the fourth quarter. In regards to payments from Rivada, Rivada remains current on all payments to Terran Orbital. Material milestone payments are expected in the second half of this year as the design phase of the program continues to ramp up. In addition, to payments related to preparing and delivering the PDR, payments are expected for the sourcing of long lead materials and critical vendors. Overall, we are anticipating invoicing and collecting approximately $180 million from Rivada in the second half of 2023. Please note that our June cash balance and receivables do not include material amounts from the Rivada program as more meaningful activity only started in July. I would also like to publicly congratulate Rivada on the successful conclusion of their previously announced regulatory process. Last month, as expected, Rivada Space Networks announced that the ITU's Radio Regulations Board approved their waiver request, which is a major regulatory milestone. I am excited with our increased backlog year-to-date. As of June 30, our backlog is $2.6 billion, representing orders for over 370 satellites, including the 300-satellite order from Rivada, which we believe is our single largest commercial constellation award ever, and the company's third largest award ever, a previously announced $87 million 16-satellite order with a new customer we signed in May. Additionally, we received a contract extension from our fourth largest active space program, a confidential mission in the national security space. For this program, we are not just supplying the satellite bus but also integrating our own internally developed payload. Our combined awards with the current total order book to over 30 programs. We estimate that approximately 80% of our $2.6 billion backlog will be converted to revenue by the end of 2025. We believe this increase in backlog will drive revenue growth this year and beyond. Operationally, we are also delivering on our commitments to our customers. We demonstrated this with our successful on-time delivery last year of our 10 Transport Layer Tranche 0 satellite buses to our partner, Lockheed Martin, for the Space Development Agency. We look forward to the extended launch of the completed Tranche 0 satellites in the coming weeks. In addition, we are on track to begin developing -- delivering the first batch of the SDA's Transport Layer Tranche 1 satellite in 2023. The balance of the 42 satellites will be delivered by the end of 2024, which will bring in approximately $65 million of additional cash. Additionally, I am pleased to announce that our RUNNER-1 satellite launched successfully on June 12 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base (sic) [Vandenberg Space Force Base] in California. This multipurpose, remote sensing satellite, Terran Orbital's first microsatellite was jointly developed with ImageSat International. We have successfully completed the spacecraft bus commissioning on July 31. Our next upcoming step is payload commissioning. Congratulations to the ImageSat team for the great progress so far for commissioning this newest satellite. As of June, our identified pipeline represents over $20 billion of opportunities. The expansion of our pipeline is due in part to increase in commercial engagements following the Rivada award announcement earlier this year. We are also harvesting benefits from our investments and broadened product offerings, expanded capacity and strengthen business development team. To support our backlog and pipeline opportunities, we are continuing to increase production capacity with our continuing investments in our design and manufacturing capabilities. We are investing in a world-class production system to support the execution of over 330 satellites in backlog and over 5,000 satellites identified in our pipeline. Our new 50 Tech facility in Irvine, California is now open, adding [60,000] square feet of floor space, bringing our manufacturing capacity from 10 satellites to 20 satellites per month, a 100% increase. Critically, this includes additional testing equipment, our new printed circuit board assembly lines and automation that we expect will vastly improve throughput, quality and speed. Since the spring, we've been moving employees at equipment and have -- now have our certificate of occupancy for all floors. We expect our now operational 50 Tech facility will be a key facilitator and completing the majority of the planned work for the 42 Tranche 1 buses. In addition, we are progressing and developing another 94,000 square foot facility in Irvine, which we expect to increase our capacity to multiples of our current capacity after commissioning in 2024. Importantly, this new capacity includes 36-foot high bay for assembly and (inaudible) of larger satellites. To help successfully manage the steep ramp in sales, we hired Tony Gingiss, an aerospace and defense industry veteran as the company's new Chief Operating Officer. Tony is based in Irvine, California and brings more than 30 years of aerospace and defense experience and design production, operations and leadership to Terran Orbital. We are thrilled to have Tony on board. He brings an innovative and experienced mind to Terran Orbital as we expand our facilities and execute on customer programs. Also in the second quarter, Terran Orbital and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense announced the signing of a memorandum of agreement to study and validate the prerequisites for the production of a new generation of election propulsion systems for satellites in the United States. This system will be based on Safran's PPSX00 plasma thruster. We believe this agreement reflects Safran's Electronics &amp; Defense space and the value of Terran Orbital's industry-leading products and innovative personnel while adding to our strategic investments to create more scalable, automated vertically integrated production systems. Now let me turn it over to Gary to review our financial performance in the quarter and provide a financial outlook for the full year. Gary?Gary A. HobartThank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report that we are on a clear path to increase revenue and improve profitability. In the second quarter of 2023, we achieved record revenue of $32.2 million, a 51% increase over the same period in the prior year. We recognized revenue on most of our programs on a percentage of completion basis and adjustments and changes to our contract values and estimated cost at completion or EACs, have a cumulative impact in the period in which we make the adjustment. In the second quarter, adjustments to our estimated completion or EACs decreased revenue by an estimated $1.2 million. Gross profit was approximately $0.8 million for the second quarter compared to a loss of $3.7 million in the same quarter in 2022. Excluding share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, included in cost of sales, adjusted gross profit in the second quarter was $2.8 million, compared to adjusted gross profit of $2.1 million in the same quarter in 2022. EAC adjustments negatively impacted adjusted gross profit by an estimated $2.5 million during the second quarter of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $29.4 million for the same quarter in 2022. SG&amp;A expenses remained virtually flat compared to the same quarter in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in share-based compensation expense and legal and other professional fees, partially offset by higher labor and benefits, research and development expense and other costs as a result of our growth initiatives. Although down year-over-year, share-based compensation still represented approximately $3.6 million of our second quarter expenses with approximately $2.8 million of that running through our GAAP SG&amp;A expense line and the $800,000 balance reflected in our cost of sales. Subject to future equity program activity, we currently expect share-based expenses to be below $5 million per quarter through the balance of this year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $21.4 million for the quarter compared with negative $14.8 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of our growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in adjusted gross profit. Overall, adjusted EBITDA loss is largely a function of our ramping capabilities -- adjusted EBITDA is largely a function of our ramping capabilities across the company to serve our multibillion dollar backlog pipeline in the coming quarters and years. This is part of an overall investment in our capabilities that supports our path to profitability for which we are well positioned, particularly given the strength of our signed order book. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.2 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $48.6 million in cash on hand and approximately $311.4 million in gross debt obligations. Turning to our outlook. We have over $2.6 billion of backlog as of June 30, 2023, and estimate approximately 80% to be recognized as revenue by December 31, 2025. We expect a steep ramp in revenue ahead and confirm our expectation of generating in excess of $250 million in revenue in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, we expect gross margins to demonstrate quarter-over-quarter improvements but the pace and size of improvements may vary depending on the program mix and execution. Overall, our capital expenditures for year 2023 are expected to be less than $30 million. I will now turn it back over to Marc.Marc H. BellGreat. Thank you, Gary. In closing, I'd like to add the appetite for satellite constellations is significantly growing with new commercial applications and geopolitical tensions as the primary drivers of demand. We have been very busy. We have 11 proposals currently outstanding within total value of $1.6 billion today. In addition, we have 27 RFIs or ROMs active valued over $900 million of additional potential revenue. Terran Orbital today is showcasing its ability to win and execute contracts with Lockheed Martin, Rivada and other marquee customers. We have a strong customer base consisting of the U.S. Defense Department, NASA, European Space Agency and a strong long-term strategic partner in Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin has shown commitment and confidence in Terran Orbital not only becoming a long-term strategic partner, but also as the shareholder. Thank you for everybody on the call for your continued support of Terran Orbital. I now look forward to taking your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Greg Konrad from Jefferies.Gregory Arnold KonradMaybe just to start on the backlog disclosure. You said 30 programs across 370 satellites. And if we strip out Rivada and SDA Tranche 1, it seems like maybe there's 28 programs at an average of 1 satellite per program. Can you maybe talk about what's in that pipeline, how much of that follow-on opportunities and how you think about some of those other programs is maybe seed corns for larger future awards?Marc H. BellSure. So we have a lot of programs, and we call it the crawl-walk-run approach. People Start with 1 satellite, and they go to 3 to 10, then they look at 100. So for example, we have a program in-house now that we're building 3 satellites for. Upon successful demonstration, they could be placing an order for 300 satellites. So you have a lot of programs that are feeder programs. And then also in that, you have a few things that are studies that don't actually have a satellite attached to it, but they are the studies that lead up to a satellite. So it's a little misleading how it breaks out. I apologize for that.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then maybe just on free cash flow. You raised some money in the quarter, but I appreciated the disclosure around the money that you expect from Rivada and also SDA Tranche 1 next year. I mean when you think about those moving pieces, are you expecting to be free cash flow positive for the second half of the year? And how are you kind of thinking about free cash flow generation in general, given working capital needs?Gary A. HobartSure, Greg, it's Gary. We have a backlog from invoicing and performance and our expectations from our EACs, which are basically our budgets for our program. Sufficient capital to be free cash flow positive on a run rate basis by the beginning or during 2024. It will be plus or minus in the second half year of the year. So the cash flow we generate from our programs and invoicing and collection and invoicing should cover our needs going forward, and we'll start seeing that ramp up even more so going into 2024.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then maybe just 1 last one. You gave the disclosure 80% conversion of backlog through the end of 2025, and we can kind of see what the implied revenues are in H2 based on guidance. You're kind of at close to run rate if you just split in 2024 and 2025 at nearly $1 billion each year. How are you thinking about the capacity in place to kind of meet backlog today and maybe just kind of the path to supporting that level of revenues in the next 2 years.Marc H. BellYes. I mean, we feel very confident of our capacity with the opening of 50 Tech. That gets us the ability to do 20 buses a month. With the opening of our new facility beginning of 2024 that will bring us up to almost 96 buses a month. But more importantly, that lets us to do about 42 complete satellites per month in the new facility, including solar panel assembly, payload assembly and everything under one roof. So the new facility is a game changer because what we'll do is the (inaudible), our original facility and 50 Tech, our new facility will be dedicated exclusively to modules when what we call (inaudible) and riverside will be 100% assembly and final satellite testing. So it's a game changer on how we do things. But we are more than prepared for not only the Rivadas of the world, to handle multiple Rivada-sized contracts under the existing infrastructure we've built or are building now.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright.Scott Christian BuckFirst of all, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color on why you're so confident in being able to monetize that $180 million from Rivada in the second half of the year? I know there's some investor hesitation around the contract. So just how do you kind of derisk that over time?Marc H. BellYes. That's why we brought it up at the very beginning of the call. We are extremely confident we're going to PDR. We have world-class engineers for design services. That's the bulk of what we're doing with PDR and then we're also focusing on long lead items. So we are very confident in our ability to deliver the PDR on time and on time, which will trigger the payment. So we are very confident in our abilities as we've done many, many PDRs over the past decade. So we have tons of experience doing this.Scott Christian BuckMarc, I guess I'm more asking about their ability to execute their end of the contract. I mean what due diligence have you done on Rivada at this point that makes you feel comfortable that they are capable of making a payment like that?Marc H. BellWe've done extreme due diligence on their financials, both with ourselves and our attorneys. We feel confident of whether -- we can't disclose what we have -- information we know, but we are very much aware of who their funding is and how much it's for and where it's coming from. So Rivada has asked that any questions about their funding be directed to them, but we can tell you that we are confident about their ability to fund.Scott Christian BuckOkay. I appreciate that, and second one you mentioned...Marc H. BellLet me add one more to this, Scott, I don't mean to interrupt. So one thing that has -- was the ITU vote, I don't want to play down with a very, very big hurdle because now their spectrum that they have is all valid. And as you know, spectrum is worth a lot of money. And so once they got into early July, that ITU vote was incredibly significant for Rivada because that made their spectrum money good. And SpaceX has also been a big supporter of them. As Peter Thiel, one of the original investors in SpaceX is also one of the original investors in Rivada. And so SpaceX has also been very supportive of the Rivada program with the ITU.Scott Christian BuckGreat. I appreciate that added color. And my second question, you mentioned previously that you have the capacity or you will have the capacity to handle multiple contracts of this size, I'm just curious, where do you see the market today? How many of those opportunities are actually out there over the next 3 to 5 years?Marc H. BellMichael -- Congressman Michael Waltz said about 2 months ago when he was -- they had a committee hearing with Saltzman, who runs Space Force testifying and he let the cat out of the bag. He said that the STC, which is the U.S. entities for licensing has applications for 60,000 satellites and that's just for the U.S. So globally, the number has got to be staggering with the ITU. I mean every country we talk to is trying to build their own constellation. Every military is trying to build their own transfer layer. Everybody is trying to do their own ISR for imaging surveillance and reconnaissance. I mean we -- just like I said at the end of my presentation before I mean we are just being inundated with tons of opportunities from around the globe. And just keeping up, we're literally just trying to keep up now with the volume of inquiries that we're getting. So we have a very high degree of confidence of not only filling the space that we have now with programs, but at some point, needing additional space will be growing so fast. And the pipeline today is twice the size of what we had before on the commercial front. I mean, the commercial side is also growing dramatically fast. I mean you think about every -- in the press, every big company is launching whether it's Internet of Things, 5G from space. Also it's a crazy amounts of commercial opportunities around the world.OperatorWe Have our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel.Erik Peter RasmussenSo we saw you did reaffirm your guidance of over $250 million, but how should we think about the revenues layering in the second half? Any more color you can provide given we're already in August?Marc H. BellYes. I mean -- so the way it works with the space development agencies Transfer Layer Tranche 1, we basically -- it's all back ended. So as we deliver buses, we get paid big chunks of money and that's all Q4 and then Rivada PDR as well is a Q4 item. So it is a very, very heavy Q4.Erik Peter RasmussenSo would you say that before -- I think you were talking about Q4 being 4x of what Q1 was, but it sounds like that's a much higher number? And could Q3 be higher than Q2? Or is everything really keep falling into Q4?Marc H. BellQ4 is the bulk of it because that's what we're delivering. A lot of it depends on third-party suppliers like (inaudible) for engine and [Interflight] for our radios. If they -- we could potentially speed up the delivery of all the buses into Q4, if our third-party suppliers could keep up with us. But right now, we're still sticking to the original April 2024 time line, but it is possible, we are moving faster than we've ever moved before. And so it's just a matter of having -- like I said last quarter, we are trying very hard to vertically integrate and you control your supply chain, you control your destiny. And the 2 things not on my supply chain currently are radios and propulsion. And those are the 2 things that are slowing us down. But as far as Q3 goes, I'll turn it over to Gary, if he want to add any more color.Gary A. HobartNo, I think that what we said about the fourth quarter still holds, generally speaking, you'll see a ramp of the third quarter over the second and then a bigger fourth quarter is our expectation.Erik Peter RasmussenOkay. Great. And then maybe just on the margins...Marc H. BellBut we're sticking with the $250 million number. If it ends up being more, that's great. But we feel very comfortable with $250 million.Erik Peter RasmussenGreat. And then maybe on margins, you expect to grow sequentially, but there's obviously some variability within that on pace and size. But maybe help us understand the components of that variability. When do you see gross margins? Where do you see them settling for the year? And then maybe sort of any update you can share for next year?Gary A. HobartSure. As we said last quarter during Q&amp;A, the bulk of what we're expecting for the back half of this year will be in the mid- to high teens. Going forward, we expect kind of mid-20% margins, and that's just based on looking at what we have in our backlog and our expectation based on budgets in our backlog.Erik Peter RasmussenOkay. Great. So no update there. And then maybe on the competitive landscape, have you seen any changes, anything in the last 90 days since our last update. There's been a lot of consolidation in the space and maybe just your thoughts on sort of staying independent.Marc H. BellWe've seen -- we watch what happened with the (inaudible) first satellite. They launched [brick-into-space]. It's not too easy as we keep trying to tell people. It's an art form. We are -- we like being independent and it gives us -- we believe it works for us. We are ever expanding our ability to work with many more and more customers, both around the globe. And we're very happy with where we are right now.Erik Peter RasmussenGreat. And then any other color you can give on the new award, the 16 satellites? Any time line maybe when these satellites would be delivered?Marc H. BellAt the customer request, we're not giving out any information, sorry.OperatorNext question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnGary, just could you dig into the second half revenue cadence, maybe a little bit more in terms of -- is it all in the fourth quarter? I guess, Marc, you were suggesting it's really hockey stick at the end of the year. But on percentage of completion accounting, shouldn't we see sales ramp to some extent here in Q3. So how do we think about Q3 and Q4? That's the first question.Gary A. HobartSure, Rob. I think my comments a couple of minutes ago, I think are most I'm going to dig into on that. Look at $250 million for the full year, with third quarter being bigger than second and fourth bigger than third. I really don't want to provide more details on that there. Any changes in particular with third-party deliveries and third-party performances can have a significant move from one week to the next or one month to the next. And so we're going to limit ourselves in terms of just giving more glossy discussions about how the $250 million plays out, which would be more than $190 million for the second half.Robert Michael SpingarnRight. So what's the right way to think about this implied kind of $190 million in revenue in the second half, how much of that is Rivada's? How much of it is SDA? It sounds like SDA delivers next year. So just how do we think about the allocation of that revenue across the programs.Gary A. HobartSure. I don't think we're going to break it down precisely, but I think you can back into our $2.6 billion of backlog as being roughly $2.4 million from Rivada, a little under $100 million from Lockheed Martin, including the SDA program that we're working on and we'll expect to finish by the end of this year or April of next year. And then the other $100 million are other programs. The -- I would say that we haven't really broken down the mix. It comes up to that $190 million number. But if you think about the ramp we're showing in Rivada and what we started the year with, it's probably close to a little under half from Rivada and the balance from other backlog.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then just to clarify, I think you said, Gary, that from a free cash perspective, it's kind of plus or minus for the second half. Did I hear that right? In other words, about breakeven?Gary A. HobartIt could be about breakeven.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then you'd become cash flow positive at some point in '24. Just want to make sure I got all this.Gary A. HobartThat's correct. That's correct.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And so what is the capital plan at this point going forward, either for you or for Marc, how do you think about raising cash to the extent that you need to?Marc H. BellIt's really just about timing of payments at this point. Right now, the last thing any of us want to do is raise additional cash. I don't want the dilution. (inaudible) shareholders, I could say that. Last thing I wanted any dilution. So it's really just about timing of payments. If things work out as planned, we will be in pretty good shape. So right now, everything is lining up well for us.Operator(Operator Instructions) With our next question comes from (inaudible) from B. Riley Securities.Unidentified AnalystI want to jump back to the competitive landscape and margins. So LeoStella recently talked about a bigger bus to focus on SDA contracts. Maxar is making a bigger push into small sats, then you have York and Millennium sort of ramping up capacity alongside yourselves. Obviously, that highlights the demand, Marc, that you were talking about earlier, but how is this translating into the bid and proposal process? Is it having any effect on your prior expectations regarding how you think about gross margins when you're bidding for contracts? Or said differently, is your ability to grow margins as quickly as you might have thought in the past changed at all?Marc H. BellIt's just like launch. There is an incredible shortage of launch and there is an incredible shortage of capacity to build satellites. I mean think about it, 60,000 satellites are on file with the SEC right now. If you add up all the capacity in the United States, it doesn't even come anywhere near close to that. It's a fraction of that. So we see continued margin expansion as we continue to grow. It's also as we add payloads into the mix, we're adding more value into the mix, which also allows us to grow margins. And our margins, obviously, were very small when we started off on this and they're becoming now more appropriate for the size of business and what we're doing for the customer.Unidentified AnalystOkay. So I guess related to that, how are the gross margins -- or how are you looking at gross margins for Rivada. And how does that stack up to the guide that Gary gave earlier in terms of going to sort of mid- to high-teens, mid-20%?Marc H. BellWe don't bring our customer margins for obvious reasons on our call. But that said, we're very comfortable with our overall blended gross margin and where it's going.Unidentified AnalystSure thing. And then just in terms of the EAC adjustments, any expectation on when those are going to begin to abate?Gary A. HobartI think we're seeing them level off right now. A lot of it really comes down to (inaudible) as we're doing ramping up module production and really commissioning out all of our lines. It's really hard to tell. The numbers have kind of leveled off the last couple of quarters, but I would expect them to stay low and hopefully get down to something we're not even to the point of reporting. But right now, I feel like they seem bigger just because we're dealing with smaller numbers. But relative to our backlog, I would expect them to be de minimis going forward, but that's going to be part of how we execute and commission our overall offering.Unidentified AnalystOkay. All right. Great. And then just last one for me, I wanted to shift gears, talk about Lockheed. They opened up a new 20,000 square foot low bay facility earlier this month for satellite inauguration and testing. Can you just comment on how this fits into yours and Lockheed's overall small satellite supply chain and just your overall ability to continue service and growing defense demand?Marc H. BellIt's actually -- it's perfect for what we do with Lockheed. So there, we're using a GPS III facility to do the assembly and test for the SDA Transfer Layer. It really required its own facility. So we build the buses for them at our facility. We shipped the buses to their new facility to do the solar panel integration and payload integration and final testing. So it's very complementary to what we're doing. It's similar to our version of a Goodyear that we're going to be doing for us. They have their own Goodyear for them. which is (inaudible). So it's a very complementary facility for us to work with.OperatorWe have a follow-up question from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel.Erik Peter RasmussenJust a real -- here's just a clarification. You mentioned the Tech 50 facility is opened in Irvine. Are you now at the 20 satellite per month capacity run rate? Or is there still some work to do to get to that run rate?Marc H. BellWe are there.OperatorThank you. We have no further questions on the line. I will now hand back to the management team for closing remarks.Marc H. BellGreat. Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate everyone's participation and being patient with us as we grow as a company. We are very mindful of our cash flow, mindful of we don't want dilution. We are very mindful that we are -- we have a lot coming up in Q4. Q4 is a very big quarter for us. And then that ramp will continue on next year, which is pretty exciting. So -- and we look forward to anybody who wishes to come to visit the facility. We always encourage that to see the new 50 Tech at operation and see what we do. And with that, I will turn it back over to the operator. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.Marc H. BellOperator, thank you.]"

After hitting an end-of-July $457 high, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) pared back its gains and fell about 2% with plenty of intraday volatility on the charts. Although we’re closer to the Fed’s soft landing promises than many expected just a year ago, plenty of economic turmoil lies beneath the surface. For many investors, today’s stock values are higher than they should be, considering inflation, more rate hikes in the future, and general uncertainty.

Plus, August’s choppiness might be a sign investors are taking profits while they can. At the same time, though, a handful of key blue chip stocks are massively undervalued. These blue chip stocks have solid fundamentals and steady growth projections but remain widely ignored in the face of renewed tech exuberance.While they may not mark a true all-time low today, these blue chip stocks are down on their luck. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: AT&amp;T (T)A digital illustration of the telecom industry.Source: ShutterstockLike many telecom stocks, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) declined rapidly over the past few months on allegations of lead contamination. The allegations, first published in July, pushed AT&amp;T’s share price down more than 10% before it settled around $14 per share this month. However, the problem may not be as prevalent as initially reported. Better, investors bullish on the telecom could see substantial upside from AT&amp;T as the company works through the legal process and deploys planned growth strategies. In fact, on July 25, AT&amp;T published a press release detailing its plan to address lead-clad cabling concerns. They’re currently working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to test and assess the extent of the potential liability. Still, analysts assess see limited long-term fallout and that “the market is overly pessimistic on AT&amp;T’s future.”Story continuesAT&amp;T’s wireless revenues are continually increasing. Profitability is up, and free cash flow is increasing. AT&amp;T might be one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy, especially with its 7% dividend yield. General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) will likely be one of the first legacy manufacturers to pivot into electric vehicles successfully. Plus, GM’s recent partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) only reinforces its dominant position. Furthermore, the company announced that all five of its electric vehicles will have highly-anticipated vehicle-to-home charging capabilities in the next few years. That means the vehicles will act as supplemental power sources for the home. This capability is critical in emergencies like hurricanes that cut power across states. GM is priced around where it was pre-pandemic, indicating investors see much less downside than they did when the stock skyrocketed to almost $60  in 2021. Still, with GM’s current industry dominance and forward-thinking management, GM is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy.  Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockDisney (NYSE:DIS) has long been a blue chip stock favorite, but it’s seen better days. The stock hit a 5-year low this week, and investors seem to be running for the door. But, practically speaking, little’s changed in Disney’s overall outlook to create such bearish sentiment. And the company isn’t resting on its laurels, either. Instead, it’s adapting to changing media trends and is keeping pace with even the biggest “new media” giants. Disney embraced streaming wholly in recent years. The company leveraged its vast media empire, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, to capture a growing share of cable cutters. Disney also remains adept at managing their vast intellectual property catalog, licensing franchises to generate massive profits. Star Wars and Marvel alone are worth a combined $95 billion, and watchers of both aren’t demonstrating franchise fatigue yet. Ultimately, Disney won’t lose their crown anytime soon, and investors looking for blue chip value should be bullish on Mickey. Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is priced well below its pandemic highs. However, it still remains a quality blue chip stock for long-term portfolios. Expectedly, COVID-related sales fell substantially this year, although upcoming cold weather might boost revenues. Still, Pfizer’s core holdings remain robust. Beyond COVID-19 products, net sales jumped 5% this quarter. Pfizer remains focused on the future, with a robust pipeline ensuring a steady stream of revenue. Its production and distribution networks also ensure the company can compete against generics, threatening its bottom line. Analysts are just as bullish on Pfizer, with estimates indicating PFE is nearly 35% undervalued today. The company’s growing revenue, profits, and 4% dividend yield also make Pfizer perfect for undervalued blue chip seekers. Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comUnfortunately, geopolitical conflict is here to stay. That makes Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) a dominant stock in the defense industry. Most recently, Lockheed beat earnings expectations. Better, its flagship F-35 program promises to remain a cash cow by producing new equipment and maintaining existing global fleets. Likewise, the US government remains on high alert with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, US defense spending grew to $1.77 trillion in 2023, with $270 billion allocated toward contracts. Lockheed accounts for 28% of US defense contract spending, so it’s reasonable to infer that growing defense budgets bode well for this defense industry blue chip stock.JP Morgan Chase (JPM)Source: ShutterstockInvestment giant JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just reported a profit of $14.5 billion, even amid economic constraints and interest rate hikes raising its cost of business. JP Morgan is the most dominant bank in the industry, making its recent fall from grace even more surprising. But that dominance is unquestioned, and JP Morgan’s competitive advantage remains intact. JP Morgan is one of, if not the largest consumer and commercial banking company in America, extending its reach into Latin America. Geographic diversification is key for continued growth. JP Morgan demonstrates they have what it takes to keep their global advantage. Finally, JP Morgan emerged largely unscathed from the early year’s banking crises. This resilience means they’re well-positioned to withstand further economic chaos. This stability should make blue-chip investors confident in the company.   Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) suffered through energy market turbulence. Still, global oil prices are rapidly stabilizing, and Chevron is poised for a breakout. The company’s July earnings report saw an earnings drop on global oil market instability. However, Chevron remains ready with a hefty cash reserve. The oil giant is also happy to appease investors, buying back $4.4 billion worth of stock last quarter and projecting another $3 billion repurchase this quarter. Analyst consensus indicates Chevron is a Strong Buy, with 14 recommending immediate purchase, 2 projecting outperformance, and the remaining 12 maintaining that the stock is worth holding.  Chevron also remains committed to a sustainable future. The company invests heavily in low-carbon ventures to meet a (possibly) inevitable pivot away from oil and gas. The company’s pledged a $10 billion investment in the sector by 2028, and Chevron’s existing ecosystem makes it prime to capture a growing green market. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in GM.

139,bc2356b0-3a98-3a4c-bf6c-a1b3c67311e8,PHM,2023-08-16,PulteGroup (PHM) Banks on Land & Asset Efficiency Strategies,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-banks-land-asset-181800076.html,1692123480,STORY,"['PHM', 'DHI', 'LEN-B', 'TOL']","[Despite a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and significant inflation, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM has been gaining from land acquisition strategies, margin expansion moves and business expansion via community openings in various locations. The company regularly raises shareholders’ value via repurchases and dividend distributions, boosting investors’ sentiment.Although backlog is still lower than the prior year for PHM and other leading homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Lennar Corporation LEN and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope. Also, the lack of existing homes for sale, a focus on cost control, stabilized mortgage rates and increased operating leverage are raising hope.Let’s delve deeper into the factors influencing this leading homebuilder.Land Acquisition &amp; Development to Improve ProfitabilityPulteGroup’s land acquisition strategies aim to improve volumes, revenues and profitability on an annual basis. In second-quarter 2023, the company spent $370 million on land acquisition and $523 million on related development. Considering the strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities, the company expects land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. Of these, it estimates 65% to go toward the development of owned land positions.Apart from this, PulteGroup’s land strategy emphasizes investing in shorter-lived, smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements, when possible, thereby mitigating market risk.These initiatives helped PHM post impressive results in second-quarter 2023. Adjusted earnings per share beat the consensus mark by 21.5% and increased by 9.9% year over year.Home sale revenues increased nearly 8% year over year, mainly due to the higher closings and average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues also rose 11.2% from a year ago.Story continuesCost Control &amp; Focus on First-Time/Entry-Level BuyersTo mitigate the accelerated raw material prices, PHM and its peers have undertaken various cost control measures and focused on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved by 50 basis points in the second year.PulteGroup remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, which aim at lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. In second-quarter 2023, it comprised 41% of first-timers, 34% of move-ups and 25% of active adults. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with its strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space.Community Expansion Strategy to Offset Inflationary WoesChanging demography has lifted demand for new homes in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.PHM has been expanding its reach in various markets via community openings and recently announced community openings in various locations. On Jun 29, it unveiled the opening of its first communities in Greenville and Columbia, SC.The company expects the community count to grow 5-10% in the third and fourth quarters.Driving Shareholder ValuePHM has been paying quarterly dividends for nearly four decades. It has consistently focused on sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a solid financial position. In December 2022, it announced a quarterly dividend hike of 7% to 16 cents per share.In the first half of 2023, PulteGroup declared cash dividends of $71.8 million and repurchased 6.4 million shares under the repurchase authorization for $400 million. On Apr 24, 2023, its board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $982.9 million remaining in authorization.Recent Releases of Above Mentioned StocksD.R. Horton reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023) results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.On a year-over-year basis, although earnings declined, revenues increased. The company highlighted that the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and that the demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. This tailwind has helped this Arlington, TX-based homebuilder witness net sales order growth of 37% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.Lennar reported impressive results for second-quarter fiscal 2023, where earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The housing market condition is normalizing and has been gaining from the pent-up demand, given the shortage of existing homes in the sector. The homebuilder has also lifted its delivery expectations for the year.Toll Brothers reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Apr 30, 2023). Both the top and bottom lines topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the company delivered strong quarterly earnings and an improved gross margin for the quarter despite the ongoing challenges in the industry.The company’s quarterly results reflected stabilized mortgage rates and improved buyer confidence, resulting in higher demand for homes. This, combined with its policy of boosting its supply of spec homes into the spring selling season and focusing on operational efficiency, has helped the company deliver solid fiscal second-quarter results.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Considering the current situation, an investor might not be encouraged to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets.In the current scenario, we recommend stocks like Arcosa, PulteGroup, Livent, Atmos Energy and Teekay Tankers, which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let's explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don't want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Arcosa: It is a manufacturer of infrastructure-related products and services, which serve construction, energy and transportation markets. On Aug 3, 2023, Arcosa announced its second- quarter 2023 results. Its second-quarter revenues worth $584.8 million went down 3% year over year.

The POLARx FIT Cryoablation Balloon Catheter is a component of the new system intended to treat people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This catheter has the unusual ability to accommodate two balloon diameters, 28 and 31mm.The latest approval is likely to bolster Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular segment.More on POLARx Cryoablation SystemIn February 2020, the POLARx Cryoablation System gained the CE Mark, and in October 2021, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) granted its certification. In 2023, the POLARx FIT catheter was given the go-ahead in Europe, Japan, Canada, and several Asia Pacific markets.The latest system overcomes recognized drawbacks by rethinking current cryoablation options, enabling doctors to expand and modify the new POLARx catheter to match a patient's unique anatomy during an ablation treatment, which can reduce the need for time-consuming and disruptive device replacements. Additionally, the tool enables medical professionals to treat a more extensive variety of pulmonary vein anatomy and to design lesions in ideal locations to more effectively deliver therapy to the parts of the heart from which the disruptive impulses that cause AF originate.Data from the global, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm FROZEN-AF IDE clinical trial, which was presented at Heart Rhythm 2023, showed that the POLARx Cryoablation System was safe and efficacious for the treatment of 385 patients with paroxysmal AF.Significance of POLARx Cryoablation SystemThe expandable cryoballoon catheter in particular, part of the new POLARx Cryoablation System, is an exciting advancement for the successful treatment of AF since it enables medical professionals to better customise care for individual patients without compromising safety or effectiveness. As observed in the clinical evaluation, the system's maneuverability, combined with the ability to use different balloon sizes, allows it to address long-standing issues with various cardiac anatomy.Story continuesThe FDA clearance of the POLARx Cryoablation System, which has been used for more than 25,000 patients globally, heralds a significant development in managing atrial fibrillation (AF) and the dawn of a new era in cryoablation technology. This product transforms a crucial therapy in the electrophysiology field, attends to the unmet needs of physicians, and reaffirms the company’s commitment to bringing significant advancements to existing technologies by prioritizing procedural flexibility and individualized care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was valued at $22.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% by 2023. The increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and growing awareness about the condition are expected to drive the market.Peers Developments within Cardiac SegmentWithin cardiac ablation treatment, companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Abbott Laboratories ABT and Medtronic plc MDT are also making significant progress.In August 2023, Biosense Webster, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment and part of Johnson &amp; Johnson received the FDA approval for multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. The products that can be used in this workflow include: THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF catheter — the most commonly used ablation catheter in the world for RF ablation, THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter, CARTO VIZIGO Bi-Directional Guiding Sheath, PENTARAY NAV ECO High Density Mapping Catheter, DECANAV Mapping Catheters, and Webster CS Catheter.In July 2023, Abbott received the FDA approval for the AVEIR dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker system, the world's first dual chamber leadless pacing system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms. With more than 80% of people needing a pacemaker requiring pacing in two chambers of the heart (both the right atrium and right ventricle), the approval significantly increases access to leadless pacing for millions across the United States.In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for its Micra AV2 and Micra VR2, the next generation of its industry-leading miniaturized, leadless pacemakers. Micra AV2 and Micra VR2, the world's smallest pacemakers, provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers, while still delivering the many benefits of leadless pacing such as reduced complications compared with traditional pacemakers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

148,08b7108c-375e-3181-ba81-b27d141328e8,JNJ,2023-08-16,15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-blue-chip-113530961.html,1692099330,STORY,"['KO', 'DIS', 'IBM', 'JNJ', 'VZ', 'CVX', 'UNH', 'AMGN', 'MRK', 'WBA', 'NKE', 'MMM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023. If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc.

For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 11.1% year-over-year growth.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid its overall performance. It reported solid fiscal third-quarter results thanks to higher cross-border volumes. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress its margins.

150,38a665a5-3d6c-322e-a593-cdbcd0309275,MDT,2023-08-16,Is Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) Stock On A Downtrend As A Result Of Its Poor Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plcs-nyse-mdt-stock-140015592.html,1692108015,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.5%. To decide if this trend could continue, we decided to look at its weak fundamentals as they shape the long-term market trends. In this article, we decided to focus on Medtronic's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:7.3% = US$3.8b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 7.3% ROEAt first glance, Medtronic's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.0%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Medtronic has shown a meagre net income growth of 3.8% over the past five years. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high . So this could also be one of the reasons behind the company's low growth in earnings.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Medtronic's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 9.3% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDT? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Medtronic Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a high three-year median payout ratio of 82% (or a retention ratio of 18%), most of Medtronic's profits are being paid to shareholders. This definitely contributes to the low earnings growth seen by the company.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 50% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 14%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

151,225eae2c-7645-3b66-b2dd-781df858e4a7,MDT,2023-08-16,Boston Scientific's (BSX) POLARx System Gets FDA Approval,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientifics-bsx-polarx-system-133800984.html,1692106680,STORY,"['BSX', 'PXXXF', 'JNJ', 'MDT', 'ABT']","[Boston Scientific Corporation BSX recently announced receiving FDA approval for its POLARx Cryoablation System. The POLARx FIT Cryoablation Balloon Catheter is a component of the new system intended to treat people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This catheter has the unusual ability to accommodate two balloon diameters, 28 and 31mm.The latest approval is likely to bolster Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular segment.More on POLARx Cryoablation SystemIn February 2020, the POLARx Cryoablation System gained the CE Mark, and in October 2021, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) granted its certification. In 2023, the POLARx FIT catheter was given the go-ahead in Europe, Japan, Canada, and several Asia Pacific markets.The latest system overcomes recognized drawbacks by rethinking current cryoablation options, enabling doctors to expand and modify the new POLARx catheter to match a patient's unique anatomy during an ablation treatment, which can reduce the need for time-consuming and disruptive device replacements. Additionally, the tool enables medical professionals to treat a more extensive variety of pulmonary vein anatomy and to design lesions in ideal locations to more effectively deliver therapy to the parts of the heart from which the disruptive impulses that cause AF originate.Data from the global, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm FROZEN-AF IDE clinical trial, which was presented at Heart Rhythm 2023, showed that the POLARx Cryoablation System was safe and efficacious for the treatment of 385 patients with paroxysmal AF.Significance of POLARx Cryoablation SystemThe expandable cryoballoon catheter in particular, part of the new POLARx Cryoablation System, is an exciting advancement for the successful treatment of AF since it enables medical professionals to better customise care for individual patients without compromising safety or effectiveness. As observed in the clinical evaluation, the system's maneuverability, combined with the ability to use different balloon sizes, allows it to address long-standing issues with various cardiac anatomy.Story continuesThe FDA clearance of the POLARx Cryoablation System, which has been used for more than 25,000 patients globally, heralds a significant development in managing atrial fibrillation (AF) and the dawn of a new era in cryoablation technology. This product transforms a crucial therapy in the electrophysiology field, attends to the unmet needs of physicians, and reaffirms the company’s commitment to bringing significant advancements to existing technologies by prioritizing procedural flexibility and individualized care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was valued at $22.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% by 2023. The increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and growing awareness about the condition are expected to drive the market.Peers Developments within Cardiac SegmentWithin cardiac ablation treatment, companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Abbott Laboratories ABT and Medtronic plc MDT are also making significant progress.In August 2023, Biosense Webster, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment and part of Johnson &amp; Johnson received the FDA approval for multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy.

It has a long-term (three to five years) expected earnings growth rate of 9.6%.Factors That Augur WellRepublic Services consistently rewards its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the company paid $592.9 million, $552.6 million and $522.5 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $203.5 million, $252.2 million and $98.8 million, respectively.

(NYSE:RSG) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 13th of October to $0.535. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.4%. See our latest analysis for Republic Services Republic Services' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, Republic Services' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 31.3%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendRepublic Services Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.94 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.14. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.6% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Republic Services has only grown its earnings per share at 4.0% per annum over the past five years. While EPS growth is quite low, Republic Services has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders.Republic Services Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Republic Services is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

However, LAGEVRIO witnessed an 83% dip in sales, warranting some concern.Beyond the numbers, Merck also presented compelling data at a medical conference.

Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill. The estimated total capital expenditures for 2023 are $1.3-$1.4 billion.Mosaic also aims to return substantial free cash flow in 2023 to shareholders. The company strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet.However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus.

Net sales declined roughly 37% year over year to $3,394 million in the quarter. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3180.3 million. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower selling prices.Nutrien also missed earnings estimates in the second quarter.

The company did not disclose his age or nationality but said he had been leading its government operations team in China.Boeing says China will need 8,500 new airplanes and $550 billion in commercial services in the next 20 years.""I am committed to making sure our team is ready to support our customers and meet that demand,"" Liu said in the release.He succeeds Boeing veteran Sherry Carbary, who stepped down from the position of president of the China unit in July, with Liu taking up the post on an interim basis since then.Liu joined the company in 2022 from the auto industry, where he had experience in China with Ford and Chrysler.His appointment comes at a challenging time for Boeing amid geopolitical tensions between the world's two largest economies.It has also lost ground to arch-rival Airbus, which recently announced a second jet assembly line in Tianjin.Li Hanming, an independent aviation industry analyst, said Liu is the best choice for Boeing as it seeks to rebuild close ties, in part because he is physically in China.""It is very difficult to apply for working visas and send over senior executives from overseas,"" Li said. Experts say processing of visa applications has slowed since the pandemic.Story continues""Also, in the past three years, Liu did a lot of work with the civil aviation authorities and now you see 737 MAX is almost all back to sky, which shows his job is done quite well.""The company has said about 90% of its MAX jets in China had resumed commercial operation as of the end of June, after the country grounded the model following two deadly accidents in 2018/19.Based in Beijing, he will formally become Boeing China president on Sept. 1, the company said.(Reporting by Sophie Yu and Tim Hepher; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

The award has been offered by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.Valued at $15.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2023.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its E-6B is a dual-mission aircraft capable of fulfilling either the no-fail TACAMO mission or the airborne strategic command post mission. The aircraft is equipped with an airborne launch control system, which is capable of launching U.S. land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products.

Excluding auto and gas, sales rose 1.0%. This is the largest gain retail sales have seen in six months. Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at where consumers are spending.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: And retail sales came in hot for the month of July, up 7/10 of a percent compared to June. If you exclude autos and gas, sales were up a percent. This is the largest gain in six months boosted by ecommerce, which was up 1.9% likely thanks in part to Amazon Prime Day. Both of these numbers, by the way, blowing away estimates.And we also saw some upward revisions for the two prior months. In other words, consumers are spending. If you look at some of the other areas where they were spending, it wasn't just online. Food services and drinking places also saw gains of 1.4%. So we continue to see momentum in that area and, indeed, that actually accelerated in that area.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and some of the key areas that we continued to look through over the past month to see where there is some moderation here, and I look at the vehicle part of this particular report too because motor vehicle parts and dealers, that's still high. That's up right now, at least year-over-year change, 3.4%.But some of the other areas where you're actually seeing some of the larger decreases-- and this is something to keep in mind even as we talk about some of the other retail earnings report that are set to come out this week. Year over year changes down furniture and home furnishings stores. That's down by about 3.8%.You saw the year over year change for electronics and appliance stores. That's still down by about 2.1%. All of these different categories where we've heard from Target, we've heard from Walmart and some of the specialty retailers about where consumers are being more stringent about where their dollars are going and that playing a role in some of the other earnings that came out even this morning in those big ticket purchases. So with regard to that, keep a close eye on that part of this broader retail sales equation at this point.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I'm also looking here at some of the other numbers that-- month over month that saw increases. Clothing up 1.0%. Sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, and bookstores-- they throw a lot in that one-- up 1.5%. So those were some other areas of strength. Electronics and appliances down. Furniture and home furnishings you mentioned down year-over-year. Also down month-over-month. And the same goes for autos.So there were some areas of weakness, but the nonstore retailers one really stands out to me. And the clothing one stands out to me as well because that too is a reacceleration. So, you know, it's interesting here, especially as we get into the retail earnings season to see that strength in apparel specifically. You know, we've been talking to some analysts who cover the sector recently who have been a little bit more positive here.We talked to Simeon Siegel last week in the wake of the Tapestry agreement to buy Capri, but he also said that we are now at-- you know, we keep using that word normalization, but we are, he said, at a more normal level in terms of inventory for many of the apparel and specialty retailers that now will allow, you know, strong and weak management teams to come to the fore rather than the inventory winds of change that they were all subject to.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and also keeping a close eye on how those management teams, especially across department stores with-- which within this report, you take a look at that department stores line, and month over month here particularly, that jumped out to me as well because we did see a decline month over month by about 2% or 3.4% within the department stores specifically. Think about companies like Macy's. Think about companies like Nordstrom. And Nordstrom, of course, the subject one of the more viral videos right now having to deal with shrink. Many of these companies having to think about that in one facet or another.But for the department stores and where they are seeing some of that wavering in favorability at least on the sales side or on the pricing side, that's going to be particularly interesting to see how they're managing through inventory that they may have as well given the push back in price that they're seeing among the consumers. So that jumped out to me just a moment ago here even as I'm taking a look at Macy's shares-- fractionally lower here premarket. Nordstrom shares down by about 1.7% here premarket too.]"

Kashkari said the current proposal to raise the requirements for large banks ""is a step in the right direction,"" but that it ""doesn't go far enough."" Yahoo Finance Live looks at how regional bank stocks are reacting to Kashkari's comments.Video Transcript- Akiko, let's take a look at regional banks because we're also seeing some movement there those stocks under pressure today falling into the red after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned that the banking crisis may not be over. He also went on to say that proposals for stricter capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets doesn't go far enough. So we're seeing some of those jitters across the board when it comes to some of those regional plays.Kashkari, the fact that he was saying that we do see higher rates. He didn't commit. He didn't say we necessarily need another rate hike here from the Fed. But he did say if we do see another rate hike, that is what could cause a little bit more distress and a little bit more concern within some of these smaller lenders.- Yeah. When you talk about the path of rate hikes, so what he essentially said is we're a long ways away from a rate cut. That's as far as the commitment went. But going back to what we've been hearing on regional banks, he's referring to, of course, the proposal that came out from regulators for additional capital requirements.We're talking about midsized regional banks. It would be about 5% additional requirements there. And Kashkari's direct words here. He says the risk is that if inflation is not completely under control, that we have to raise rates further from there to bring it down. That they, as in the regional banks, might face more losses than they currently face today. And those pressures could flare up again in the future.Now this, of course, came on the back of a headline we got this morning about Fitch warning they may have to downgrade the credit rating of some of the larger banks as well. But certainly, any time you hear about concerns about those capital requirements, certainly things flaring up even months after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.- Yeah, certainly. We're seeing those jitters are reflected in the stock prices today.]"

Fitch cut its assessment on banks in June, but it was largely missed. If it were to be cut again, that would force Fitch to reevaluate its ratings on all the banks it covers. In the video above, American Banker Washington Bureau Chief and ""Bankshot"" Host John Heltman explains how Fitch's downgrade of the United States' credit rating combined with higher interest rates is putting pressure on banks. Overall, Heltman says ""it makes an already tense lending environment just a little bit more tense and makes the margins a little bit more thin.""Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Credit rating agency Fitch warning it could slash ratings for dozens of lenders. Saying those comments in an interview with CNBC marking the latest sign of turmoil for the industry, Fitch initially cut its overall assessment of the banking industry back in June and cautioned another downgrade could trigger a re-evaluation of more than 70 US banks under its purview, including major lenders like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.Fitch's warning comes just one week after Moody's downgraded 10 small and mid-sized banks. Joining us now is John Heltman-- American Banker Washington Bureau Chief. John, I've been trying to put this in context this morning, right? Because Fitch did the same thing that Moody's did in saying these banks were on watch for possible downgrade. Nobody sort of noticed at the time, just like nobody sort of noticed when Moody's did it a few months ago. You guys at American Banker probably noticed, but the broader market didn't notice.JOHN HELTMAN: To be fair, there was a lot going on a couple--- Yes. Exactly. So how seriously should we take this warning? Is it going to happen? What effect is it going to have?JOHN HELTMAN: Well, I'll just start here. Credit downgrades are bad. They're not good. So that is something definitely worth paying attention to. You know, I think that there's a couple of things going on here. One is, if you go back all the way to 2011, I think, it was when S&amp;P first downgraded the US sovereign debt, ratings agencies tend to kind of move together, right?Story continuesBecause they're looking at the same things. And so having just one ratings agency out there kind of downgrading the US sovereign debt for 10 years plus sort of indicated that when Moody's kind of made its move-- or sorry. Fitch made its move last week, what that sort of means is that if the US sovereign debt isn't as good as it used to be, then things like banks that are sort of, in some ways, subordinate to the credit of the country they are in, those will naturally kind of have to adjust downward as well. So that's part of it.The other part of it is that banks margins are getting squeezed in this sort of interest rate environment, right? So it now costs more to get your deposits. That's what you use to make loans. And you also have all these loans on your books that are at lower interest rates than what the prevailing rates of right now are. And, of course, you have the economy sort of cooling. So loan demand is also going down, making it harder to replace your low interest bearing loans or assets with higher interest bearing assets.So all this is of a piece, and what do I make of it? I think it seems like what it makes is it makes an already sort of tense lending environment just a little bit more tense and makes the margins a little bit more thin at a time when we're also looking at, maybe, commercial real estate having a big drop off. Any sort of external variable that that could create more uncertainty in this area is just all the more dangerous.- And so from your perspective, and just trying to summarize this too, is this a result of Fed policy or more a result of bank management?JOHN HELTMAN: I think it's-- certainly, the rising interest rates over the last year is the proximate cause of all of this. That's what's making banks' cost of funds go up, thus squeezing their margins and so on and so forth. But at the same time, the Fed isn't doing this to hurt banks. They're doing this to get inflation under control, which is arguably as or more important than banks' profit margins.- And something else that you're covering, by the way, that I want to turn to is using US lender or borrowers data. I should say and this is something that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is taking a look at. What do we need to know about it?JOHN HELTMAN: So the CFPB has said they're going to put out a proposed rule on data brokers. So the CFPB has explicitly declined to say what companies specifically would be affected by this. But it's a lot. So anyone who does data aggregation, data brokerage-- think your Googles, your Amazons, but also lots and lots of fintechs are in this space, using kind of consumer data and selling it for advertising, all sorts of different things.What this rule would do is sort of say that this kind of data collection, data collection of credit-related information can only be used for credit-related purposes, not for advertising or for whatever else. And that is definitely going to affect a lot of big data firms were this to be finalized.- How will this impact some of the social media companies where more transactions are taking place, there is more for alternative data, perhaps, that they're able to carve out and really index and fine tune based on interactions that take place in engagement that take place on their website. And for some of that, they're able to monetize that, and ultimately turn that into not just their own method of monetizing it, but a mechanism for having a commerce-type marketplace on their platform.JOHN HELTMAN: So I would assume that your Metas and your Amazons have very smart people who can figure out how to stay, to continue to operate some level of data sharing even under this rule. But the rule itself seems pretty chilling. It basically says, you can't sell consumer data-- now you can't sell consumer data without their consent.So maybe you could get people to consent to things, but yeah. It'd be pretty drastic. And now, the one thing that's interesting about this is that were this rule to be finalized and then for a Republican to take the White House in 2024, there's potential-- and for Republicans to take the House and Senate as well, you could pass something called the Congressional Review Act that would nullify this rule.However, unlike most things that CFPB does, this actually has a lot of bipartisan support. A lot of people in Congress on both sides of the aisle are pretty sick of the way that data companies kind of buying shares personal consumer information with-- in a lot of cases, without their consent.- It's really interesting. John, thanks so much for helping us break this down and reporting on this this morning. American Banker Washington Bureau Chief Jonathan Heltman, appreciate the time as always.JOHN HELTMAN: Thanks.]"

Per a Financial Times article, individual shareholders and former employees of Credit Suisse are expected to lodge a claim in Zurich’s commercial court.The claim is likely to be filed by the Swiss Investor Protection Association on behalf of around 500 retail investors who have suffered losses due to the transaction.In March 2023, in government-backed efforts to fend off panic in the global banking system, UBS had agreed to acquire Credit Suisse in an all-stock deal valued at $3.2 billion. Following the acquisition, Credit Suisse shareholders received one UBS share for every 22.48 outstanding shares held.Earlier, UBS faced a class action suit by former shareholders of Credit Suisse who suffered damages due to an inappropriate exchange ratio. Since financial regulators had decided to withdraw shareholders’ voting rights regarding the acquisition, the only resort was to move to the court.The deal value was less than half of Credit Suisse’s market value calculated which was based on the last trading day before the deal closure.Apart from these lawsuits, UBS has been constantly facing challenges and legal claims regarding this deal. Earlier, as a result of this acquisition, Credit Suisse's additional tier 1 bonds were all written down to zero. Hence, such troubled bondholders’ have also been claiming compensation for their loss.Nonetheless, UBS has been making progress on its integration of Credit Suisse. Last week, UBS announced the voluntary termination of its Loss Protection Agreement and Public Liquidity Backstop, which were offered by the Swiss government on the acquisition of Credit Suisse. Additionally, in an attempt to restore financial stability, the Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus (ELA+) loan was fully repaid by Credit Suisse as of Aug 10, 2023.UBS Group AG’s shares have gained 5.8% on NYSE over the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUBS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

The bank must refund $100 million to affected customers and pay $90 million to CFPB and $60 million to OCC.Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC agreed to pay $1 billion related to a lawsuit accusing it of overstating the progress on resolving its 2016 fake account scandal and thereby defrauding shareholders. Since 2018, WFC has been under consent orders from Federal Reserve and two other financial regulators to improve its governance and oversight.But shareholders alleged that Wells Fargo and its past management misinformed them about how swiftly the company was addressing the governance issues and risk-management systems due to which the bank opened millions of fake accounts. Accordingly, when these shortcomings surfaced, WFC's market value fell by more than $54 billion over two years ending in March 2020.However, Wells Fargo denied any wrongdoing and decided to settle to eliminate further litigation expenses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity.Novo Nordisk reports its revenue incomes through two segments: Diabetes and obesity care and Rare diseases. The diabetes and obesity care segment includes insulins, GLP-1, other protein-related products, obesity and oral anti-diabetic drugs. On the other hand, the Rare diseases segment includes hemophilia, growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy.Per the financial results of the company in the past few quarters, growth in revenues was driven by some of Novo Nordisk’s most well-known drugs like Victoza, Ozempic, Saxenda, Rybelsus and the recently launched Wegovy. In the last reported quarter, Ozempic and Rybelsus sales were up 59% and 90% year over year, respectively, demonstrating strong traction in the market.NVO’s obesity care product, Wegovy, also exceeded expectations in the second quarter after a second contract manufacturer for Wegovy initiated production in April 2023 to meet the increasing demand for the drug. Currently, the company is also looking to expand the drug’s indication as an adjunctive treatment for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events over a period of up to five years.Regulatory filings for the approval of the label expansion in the U.S. and EU markets are expected later in 2023. Possible approvals by respective regulatory bodies are expected to further drive-up demand for the drug.Its broad diabetes portfolio grants the company a strong presence in the Diabetes care market.Besides its prowess in the diabetes and obesity care market, NVO is also looking to diversify its portfolio in the rare diseases market through collaborations and acquisitions.Story continuesHowever, stiff competition from other pharma bigwigs, like Pfizer PFE and Eli Lilly LLY, is starting to take shape in the global diabetes market for Novo Nordisk. In May 2023, Pfizer shared study data showing that its oral type II diabetes candidate, danuglipron, helped patients lose weight faster than Novo Nordisk’s popular diabetes weekly injection, Ozempic. Pfizer’s danuglipron is an orally administered, small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist.The data reported by Pfizer showed that danuglipron reduced glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose at all dose levels studied and reduced body weight at doses of 80 mg or more twice daily compared with placebo. Patients treated with danuglipron lost about 10 pounds over the course of 16 weeks. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, a once-daily pre-filled insulin pen, showed a similar weight loss of about 9.9 pounds, but over 30 weeks in a similar study.Lilly’s Mounjaro/tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA), was launched last year for type II diabetes and already competes with Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic/Wegovy. Mounjaro is approved in Europe and Japan. Mounjaro also showed a superior weight-loss reduction in clinical studies for obesity indication. Lilly has initiated a rolling submission in the United States for tirzepatide in obesity that is expected to be completed soon, while a regulatory application has already been filed in the EU.Now, if danuglipron is also successful in further studies and eventually approved, it can enjoy strong demand trends as the demand for weight loss drugs is huge and rising, posing a serious threat to Novo Nordisk. Also, danuglipron is an oral pill versus weekly injections with Ozempic/Wegovy, which is an easier-to-use formulation.Additionally, the patent expiry on some of the products in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio is highly concerning. Victoza is slated to lose patent protection in the United States and EU in the days ahead. Unplanned loss of patents, interruptions of supplies and production, and other political and economic headwinds may affect future results. Persistent pricing pressure within diabetes care, especially in the United States, might also negatively impact NVO’s sales prospects.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

176,225976a6-e62a-3b26-bc8d-e9ed3f06c5e7,PFE,2023-08-16,Can Moderna (MRNA) Diversify Beyond Its COVID-19 Jab Sales?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-mrna-diversify-beyond-covid-133900368.html,1692106740,STORY,"['MRNA', 'PFE']","[Moderna MRNA is focused on expanding its portfolio of marketed products, including its COVID-19 vaccine, whose sales have declined in recent quarters.Being one of the first-ever COVID-19 vaccine developers, Moderna generated robust product sales that helped the company transform from a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company to a commercial one, with solid sales.The higher-than-expected product sales helped the company boost its cash resources. MRNAis developing more than 30 mRNA-based investigational candidates in multiple stages of clinical studies.Last month, Moderna initiated regulatory submissions for its mRNA-based RSV vaccine mRNA-1345 for use in older adults (aged 60 years and older) in several markets, including the United States, Europe and Australia. A potential launch is expected next year. If approved, mRNA-1345 could be Moderna’s second product launch.Apart from RSV, the company is currently evaluating three candidates in late-stage studies — mRNA-1010 (influenza vaccine), mRNA-1647 (cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine), and mRNA-4157/V940 [individualized neoantigen therapy (INT)].Earlier this month, Moderna announced that it completed enrolment in the phase III immunogenicity study (P303) evaluating an enhanced formulation of mRNA-1010, which is expected to improve immune responses againstthe influenza B strain. Data from the P303 study is also likely to support the company’s regulatory filing for the vaccine’s accelerated approval. Data from the P303 study is expected before September 2023-end. Given the company’s accelerated timetable for mRNA-1010, we expect mRNA-1010 to be the company’s third product launch, expected in the next year.Alongside the second-quarter results, management reported that it completed over 80% of enrolment in the pivotal phase III study evaluating its CMV vaccine mRNA-1647.Moderna and partner Merck MRK reported new data from phase IIb evaluating mRNA-4157 in melanoma indication in June. Data from the study showed that mRNA-4157combined with Merck’s Keytruda reduced the risk of distant metastasis or death by 65% compared with participants treated with Merck’s Keytruda alone. The study previously achieved its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival. Based on these positive results, Moderna/Merck initiated the phase III study on mRNA-4157 in melanoma patients last month.Story continuesBased on the encouraging clinical progress of the above candidates, management is gearing up for the commercial launches of the above candidates over the next three years.Apart from the above candidates, Moderna is also evaluating mRNA-based investigational candidates in multiple mid-stage and early-stage stages of clinical studies, targeting various indications, includingzika virus and propionic acidemia.Despite new product launch expectations and pipeline progress, Moderna continues to develop its COVID-19 vaccine to target new and evolving virus variants. Though the company expects to generate revenue from COVID-19 vaccine product sales, demand is expected to be more seasonal.In June, Moderna submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking approval for mRNA-1273.815, a monovalent vaccine designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses. Management even claims that it has built an ample supply for mRNA-1273.815 and is ready to ship the same doses for the upcoming fall vaccination season, provided that the FDA authorizes the vaccine for use.However, the company’s target markets are highly competitive. Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine already faces stiff competition from Pfizer PFE/BioNTech‘s BNTX mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech also submitted regulatory filings with the FDA for their updated monovalent vaccine targeting the XBB lineages.About the RSV vaccine, Pfizer was one of the first developers to receive FDA approval for its RSV vaccine Abrysvo for use in older adults. Pfizer is also seeking label expansion approval from the FDA for using Abrysvo in pregnant women to help prevent the disease in infants. A final decision is expected before this month’s end.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

177,da1924dd-f3ba-3b90-a2c8-0d36f997d8c3,PFE,2023-08-16,Pfizer (PFE) Seems Well-Poised for Long-Term Growth: Here's How,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-pfe-seems-well-poised-131500402.html,1692105300,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer’s PFE top line has been declining due to steep drops in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand due to the end of the pandemic. During the pandemic, Pfizer gave the world the first and most widely used vaccine, Comirnaty and the oral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid.Pfizer records direct sales and alliance revenues from its partner, BioNTech BNTX, for Comirnaty and product revenues from Paxlovid.In the second quarter of 2023, though the decline in sales of COVID products was expected, sales of several other key medicines like Prevnar, alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers BMY for Eliquis and Ibrance missed expectations. Pfizer said that some near-term individual product challenges hurt its sales performance in the quarter. The short-term headwinds included the tornado damage to Pfizer’s facility in Rocky Mount, the approval of Talzenna in the United States in a narrower patient population than expected and shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP for the RSV vaccine for older adults.Pfizer also narrowed its 2023 revenue guidance as well as its non-COVID operational revenue growth expectations.Concerns remain about its near-term growth drivers due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer looks well-positioned to deliver several breakthrough medicines in the next five years, which can drive long-term growth. In fact, Pfizer has the largest number of new product and indication launches planned for 2023, most of which are expected to occur in the second half of the year.Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in 18 months' time (all non-COVID indications), which are expected to generate around $20 billion in sales by 2030. Two-thirds of these products have blockbuster potential, according to Pfizer.The FDA approved Abrysvo, Pfizer’s RSV vaccine for older adults, in May. Zavzpret (zavegepant nasal spray), Pfizer’s CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine was approved in March 2023.Story continuesIn June, the FDA approved Litfulo (ritlecitinib), its JAK3 inhibitor for treating severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents. The FDA also approved Ngenla, a long-acting once-weekly treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency in the same month.Pfizer believes some of its new product launches like Abrysvo RSV vaccine, etrasimod for ulcerative colitis (under review in United States and EU) and its pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (under review in Europe and the United States), coupled with business development activities, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen SGEN position Pfizer strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyondPfizer offered to buy cancer drugmaker Seagen for $229 per share in cash or a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion in March.Seagen’s acquisition is expected to strengthen Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of antibody-drug conjugates. Seagen currently markets four cancer drugs — Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak. The Pfizer/Seagen transaction is expected to be closed in late 2023 or early 2024. The shareholders of Seagen have already approved the deal.The huge profits that Pfizer generated from its COVID products in 2021 and 2022 also strengthened its cash position, which is being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. The cash enabled it to acquire Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics in 2022. It also allowed Pfizer to increase investments in research and marketing investments to support its expected new product launches. Overall, the profits and cash from COVID products allowed Pfizer to support its growth plans for the second half of this decade.ConclusionOverall, after a weaker first half of 2023, Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the second half of 2023, driven by its in-line products, new launches like Abrysvo vaccine for older adults and Zavzpret as well as newly acquired products like Nurtec and Oxbryta. Nurtec ODT/Vydura was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of most of Biohaven in 2022. Oxbryta was added with the October 2022 acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here’s what you need to know:1. FTX’s Bankman-Fried headed for jail over alleged witness tampering1. Bankman-Fried used $100 mln in stolen FTX funds for political donations, US says1. Bankman-Fried heads to Brooklyn jail notorious for poor conditions Bankman-Fried jailedSam Bankman-Fried has been sent to jail in Brooklyn. He’d previously been on bail, on a $250 million bond, and staying at his parents’ home in Paolo Alto in California. But a judge revoked the bail on Friday, finding probable cause that he had tampered with witnesses at least twice. (New to the story? Check out previous Reuters reporting on who Bankman-Fried is, what went wrong at FTX, why he was arrested, and the charges he faces.) Prosecutors said that Bankman-Fried had had more than 1,000 phone calls with journalists and that he’d “crossed a line” by sharing his former romantic partner Caroline Ellison’s diary with a New York Times reporter. Ellison is expected to testify against Bankman-Fried, so prosecutors argued that he was trying to harass her and dissuade others from testifying by suggesting that he could share unflattering information about them too. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said he just wanted to defend his reputation and that he had a right to speak to the press. Now, Bankman-Fried has to prepare for his Oct. 2 trial from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Inmates there currently include Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras (who has pleaded not guilty to trafficking charges) and exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui (who has pleaded not guilty to fraud). It’s notorious for its poor conditions, with staffing shortages, power outages and reports of maggots in inmates’ food. Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell compared the surveillance conditions there to where Hannibal Lecter was incarcerated in The Silence of the Lambs, “despite the absence of a cage and plastic face guard.” Safe to say it’ll be a far cry from the luxury Albany resort where Bankman-Fried used to live in the Bahamas. On Monday, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers asked the judge to make sure he gets access to his medications in jail: a daily Emsam skin patch for depression and three or four doses a day of Adderall for ADHD. Then, on Tuesday, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried used money stolen from his customers to make more than $100 million in U.S. political campaign donations before the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. More on that here. To be sure: Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges over FTX’s collapse and has denied stealing funds. Meanwhile, crypto markets are still sluggish, with bitcoin stuck below $30,000. Traders are still waiting to see if the SEC will approve a spot bitcoin ETF or what’ll become of PayPal’s stablecoin launch. Speaking of which, Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters said she was “deeply concerned” about PayPal launching its own stablecoin in the absence of a federal regulatory framework for crypto assets.

The company's stock price currently stands at $60.08, which will be compared to its GF Value, an estimation of its fair value.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, the stock of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is estimated to be significantly undervalued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. However, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $60.08 per share, PayPal Holdings stock is estimated to be significantly undervalued.Story continuesBecause PayPal Holdings is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisEvaluating Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. PayPal Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.94, which ranks better than 66.8% of companies in the Credit Services industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks PayPal Holdings's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. PayPal Holdings has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $28.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.57. Its operating margin is 16.68%, which ranks worse than 52.88% of companies in the Credit Services industry. Overall, the profitability of PayPal Holdings is ranked 10 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock.

PayPal Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 73.69% of companies in the Credit Services industry. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.3%, which ranks better than 54.32% of companies in the Credit Services industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, PayPal Holdings's ROIC was 16.66, while its WACC came in at 11.76.Is PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is estimated to be significantly undervalued.

However, she said that PayPal’s crypto push is more about “optionality,” or bets that may or may not yield returns. “At this point, it’s not very core to the business.”‘Change was needed’While PayPal has been the standard-bearer for digital payments since its founding in 1998, the company has recently fought to keep up with a new crop of competitors.There’s Block, the payments company founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Apple has gained market share through its recent suite of financial products. And even Google has tried to push its way into online payments. “The biggest issue PayPal faces today is that they have come under competitive pressure in their core branded-checkout business,” Trevor Williams, a fintech analyst at Jefferies, told Fortune.Moreover, ever since Schulman announced his retirement, the CEO succession “has been a key overhang over PayPal’s stock,” Rawat of AB Bernstein told Fortune.However, among investors, according to analysts Rawat and Williams, there may have been a collective sigh of relief on Monday when PayPal anointed Chriss as Schulman’s heir apparent. Although Chriss is unknown to many payments analysts, PayPal will benefit from an external candidate injecting new life into the company, Rawat and Williams said.“Change was needed,” Williams added. “Having a fresh face is what investors were looking for.”Update, Aug. 15, 2023: This article has been updated with more information about Chriss’s crypto wallet.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to highlight several of the biggest challenges Chriss will have to address in his new role, including competition from other payment apps.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, back in February, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman announced that he would be retiring at the end of the year. On Monday, the company announced that Alex Chris, the Executive Vice President of Small Business and Self-employed Group at Intuit, would be taking over the position come September.Let's bring in ""Yahoo Finance's"" Allie Garfinkle to discuss more. Hey. Ali.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Rachelle. So quite simply, Chris is walking into a minefield here. And there are going to be three key things he needs to contend with immediately day one as PayPal CEO. And the first and probably the most important is growth.Now, I'm not just talking about revenue growth here. I'm talking about margins. Margins have been a key issue for PayPal for some time right now. And last year, they were the center of the company's activist battle with Elliott. And it persisted in being a problem to this day.We only need to look back at Q2 to see that. Here's a staggering statistic for you, Rachelle, 11% of total payment volume growth and 7% total revenue growth in Q2 for PayPal. But that spurred a mere 1% gross profit growth. So this is something that there is going to be a lot of pressure on Chris to deal with immediately.Now, the second thing is going to be competition PayPal has had this incumbent advantage for a long time. And that incumbent advantage is slowly disappearing. A recent Deutsche Bank survey is the place to look for this. Square owns Cash App. And there's, of course, Apple Pay. And both have really been gaining ground, gaining adoption.For instance, in the past year, respectively, Cash App, and PayPal, reached 46% and 31% adoption. Those are spikes of high single, low double digit, since the year prior.Story continuesThe last thing to consider, of course, here, then is the shoes, of course, that Chris will be filling. Dan Schulman the CEO of PayPal has been the CEO of PayPal since 2014, when it went public as spinning off as its own company from eBay. And Schulman isn't just any CEO. He really is a legend in his own right. And Chris is going to be filling his shoes at a moment when the company's stock hasn't done well, even amid a broader tech rally.To that end, Rachelle, PayPal stock at the moment I sat down in this chair is down 17% year-to-date.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then digging into this then, just how important has Shulman been to the financial services landscape during his tenure?ALLIE GARFINKLE: I think it's a really good question, Rachelle. Because in a lot of ways, Shulman really is the first of his kind. He's someone who's existed for a long time at the intersection of these entrenched industries and tech. Shulman, even before PayPal, he was someone who was really notable.He was the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile. He was this early formative CEO of Priceline. This is almost, in the case of Shulman, like a tech founder stepping aside. That's how associated he has become with PayPal. And this isn't just a succession too. It really is signaling a new era.And Shulman himself has-- also, I think it's not an exaggeration to say Shulman has been a cultural figure in a lot of ways. I was talking to our executive editor Brian Sozzi about this today. And we both were like, man, have we ever seen him without his cowboy boots on?He also became one of the first CEOs to practice martial arts in a really public way. I believe he practices Krav Maga. So it's the thing where Shulman himself has come to represent a lot. And I don't think it's an exaggeration even to say that he's someone who has helped reshape how we think about American capitalism, payments, and tech.RACHELLE AKUFFO: You mentioned Krav Maga. I can think about that face off between Musk and Zuckerberg here. Maybe a new contender enters the ring gear as he takes the helm here at PayPal. Great always to get your updates. Our very own, Allie Garfinkle.]"

(Operator Instructions) The earnings press release accompanying this conference call was issued at the close of the market today. The quarterly report, which includes the company's results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was filed with the SEC today.On our call today our rival Chairman Ben Errez, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Fredi Nisan -- excuse me, also add Gene Jones, who is, excuse me, the interim Chief Financial Officer. Fredi Nisan is the Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Operating Officer, Min Wei.I'd like to remind everyone that statements made on today's call and webcast, including those regarding future financial results and industry prospects are forward-looking and may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the call, please refer to the company's regulatory filings for a list of associated risks. The replay of this call webcast will be available for the next 90 days on the company's website under the Events section.(Operator Instructions)At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ben Errez, the company's Chairman. Ben, the floor is yours.Ben ErrezThank you for joining us today. Today's call is entirely produced using AI in a continued push for efficiency and cost reduction for the company.I am proud to present our fiscal second-quarter 2023 financial results, where we delivered record top-line revenue for the third consecutive quarter of $14.8 million, an increase of nearly 113% year over year. This reflects a 31% sequential increase from $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue was also above our Q2 target range of $12.5 million to $14 million.As I covered in past calls, our focus on improving processing efficiency, workforce, and technology are paying off as we continue to see our operating margins increase. We processed $678 million during the quarter, an increase of 20% from the first quarter 2023 and above our target range of $580 million to $610 million. COO Min Wei will break down the various processing channels performance later in the call. But needless to say, we are very pleased with steady processing volume growth and our improved margin profile.Now to move on to some of our key operating initiatives and the progress we've made recently. First is our planned spin-off of coyni. We initiated this process early in Q2 as part of a broad value creation strategy. And ultimately, we believe this is the optimal way to drive growth and unlock its tremendous potential. While we have made great strides with our payment processing business, we believe the best path forward to create value for our shareholders is to the spin-off of coyni as a public company and establishing it as the premier electronic token solution in the market.During the quarter, we acquired a public shell company to transfer coyni assets to in order to facilitate the transaction, which our Board of Directors has approved. The name change process is underway and we expect to be finalized soon. Furthermore, we selected Simon &amp; Edward as auditor of coyni, given their familiarity with RYVYL technology, accounting processes, and personnel.Once complete, we can look toward the next phase of a public offering we expect to be in the $40 million range along with Nasdaq uplist and ultimately a Board-approved special dividend for RYVYL shareholders. We'll provide more updates on this front as they come about but expect to complete this by the end of the year.Turning now to our banking-as-a-service platform, we continue to gain momentum on this initiative in 2023 with several new partners and growing demand for the service after signing six global financial institutions. This is projected to process more than $100 million per month in transaction when fully ramped up. RYVYL's banking-as-a-service solution offers API integrations and foreign exchange capabilities in more than 40 different currencies with local settlements.The service authorizes transactions 24 hours per day on business days and enables payouts by way of approved methods such as real-time payment for direct deposits. In addition, the service allows for the ability to readily trace transactions and reduce fraud, all while maintaining strict compliance requirements.During the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Intercash, a Europe-based global payment solutions provider. Through the collaboration, business customers can now offer co-branded debit and prepaid cards to untapped consumer markets, leveraging RYVYL's new banking-as-a-service platform as the infrastructure.White label cards can be issued as virtual or physical, allowing businesses enhanced flexibility. Intercash, which currently has over 1 million cards issued, has already initiated the first phase of the process by moving more than 50,000 cards to the RYVYL card program and plans to continue with the migration in phases based on card issuance.Our subsidiary RYVYL EU made noticeable strides in Q2 receiving approval from the European Payments Council to launch Single Euro Payments Area instant payments in Europe via SEPA, an instant credit transfer scheme that encompasses over 20 payment service providers in the Eurozone, a targeted business client space for RYVYL EU. This service capability allows clients to instantly, send and receive payments from 36 SEPA countries, facilitating faster payment transfers and enhancing customer experience for our clients in the European markets.RYVYL EU also partnered with Visa to enable Visa Direct, a cutting-edge transfer solution as part of our business transformation of obtaining payments infrastructure. Doing so provides a superior banking-as-a service offering and better serves our customers retain their loyalty and create new revenue streams. This collaboration in the Eastern European region will revolutionize the way funds are transferred between accounts, offering fast, convenient, and secure transactions.When the new Visa Direct capability is integrated into RYVYL service offerings, our customers will have the opportunity to send money to authorized accounts in over 80 countries across multiple currencies to Visa's extensive network of local banking partners.By utilizing Visa Direct, our clients will experience the benefits of faster access to funds with money becoming available within minutes instead of days. By the end of the year, we expect to have a global payments platform integrated with SEPA and Visa Direct, enabling local settlements in the key markets we serve. We believe banking-as-a-service is the future of global banking, and we're excited to be an enabling service provider in this space that is rapidly emerging and reaching new customers every day.We also took meaningful steps to bolster our capital structure announcing an exchange agreement with the holder of our $100 million convertible note financing. We completed the initial exchange, resulting in a $6 million debt reduction and an increase in shareholder equity and cash flow. The second exchange is also possible upon shareholder approval which would further reduce our debt by $16.7 million for a total of $21 million debt reduction. This type of institutional-level commitment is a major win for all RYVYL stakeholders and illustrates the conviction in our mission as a disruptive force in digital payments landscape.Operationally, during the quarter, we welcomed Gene Jones as Interim Chief Financial Officer of the company. For over 35 years, Gene has served within various executive roles including CFO, COO, Corporate Treasurer, and Controller for public, private equity, venture-funded, and start-up companies. His strong leadership and expertise in financial and operational improvements has had an immediate positive impact on our company.As we stand today, the second quarter exceeded our expectations with record top-line results, and we saw positive momentum for our business transformation of obtaining payments infrastructure. Doing so provides a superior banking-as-a-service offering with partners at Visa, European Payments Council, and Intercash.We remain highly focused on executing towards this large opportunity ahead of us in the lucrative digital payments landscape. We are thrilled with the expansion and higher margin acquiring processing volume, both internationally and domestically.Coyni's spin-off strategy is moving forward and has taken meaningful steps towards completion. We remain confident we are on the path to creating significant long-term value for our shareholders.And now to discuss the details of our financial results, I'd like to turn the call over to our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Gene Jones. Gene, the floor is yours.Story continuesGene JonesThank you, Ben. I'll be referring to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. For the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures, please refer to our 10-Q filing, which will be available on the company website under SEC filings.Our revenue increased by $7.9 million or 113% to $14.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, from $6.9 million for the year-earlier quarter. The increase was principally attributable to an increase in processing volume in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the year-earlier quarter and an increase in revenues from our acquiring businesses, including Charge Savvy, RYVYL EU, and American Samoa.North America Q2 revenue increased 86% from $5.9 million in Q2 2022 to $11 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. EU Q2, revenue was $3.8 million, increasing by 270% from $1 million for the year-earlier quarter. Cost of revenue increased by $4.5 million or 106% to $8.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, from $4.2 million for the year-earlier quarter. Gross margins increased to 41% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to 39% in the year-earlier quarter.Payment processing consists of various processing fees paid to gateways and commission payments to the independent sales organizations, or ISOs, responsible for establishing and maintaining merchant relationships from which the processing transactions ensue. Cost of revenues increased chiefly due to increased volume resulting in higher processing fees paid to gateways, commission payments to ISOs, and cost of revenue of acquired businesses in the US and EU.Operating expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 1.4%, to $11.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, from $11.6 million for the year-earlier quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher general administrative and professional fees for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, offset by decreases in advertising and marketing, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization.The higher general and administrative expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, are mainly attributable to nonrecurring legal settlements and some ongoing matters and related legal fees, writing off some non-continuing legacy accounts, and accounting fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements.Other expense was $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to other income of $20.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The biggest portion of this change was in the highly volatile change in the fair value of derivative liability. That amount was a charge of $0.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to a credit of $26.4 million in the year-earlier quarter, a swing of nearly $27 million.Interest expense, including expense related to the accretion of debt discount related to the $100 million convertible note decreased by $3 million from the year-earlier quarter due primarily to a lower level of amount of debt outstanding. Additionally, we incurred a charge of $0.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, related to the conversion of debt, and we recognized a loss of $0.8 million in the year-earlier quarter in connection with the settlement of debt. You may recall that we had a restatement of previously issued financial statements, and so there are some carryover effects from that, including a $1.2 million charge in the second quarter.This was a challenging mission, but we believe we have substantially all the restatement effects behind us. However, if we exclude the effects of that highly volatile change in the fair value of our derivative liability and the non-recurring carryover effects of financial statement restatements, other non-operating expenses increased by about $300,000 in the second quarter compared to the year-earlier period.In summary, we recorded a net loss of $12 million in the second quarter. This compares to $12 million in net income in the year-earlier period, primarily due to $26.4 million income related to the change in the fair value of our derivative liability last year versus this year's change in fair value of derivative liability expense of $0.2 million. But there were also several non-recurring items in this year's quarter. Our second-quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA is a loss of $0.9 million compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of last year.Non-recurring items totaled $5.5 million for the quarter and include legal settlements, legal matters, and related fees, charge-offs of some non-continuing legacy accounts, and accounting fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $63.9 million with $13.2 million of that being unrestricted cash.I'll now turn the call over to Min Wei, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide a review of business operations and our outlook.Min WeiThank you, Jim, we will walk through our processing volumes for the verticals we serve and discuss our 2023. Please note that all the figures are exclusive of the Sky Financial portfolio. While Q2 processing volume across all channels exceeded $678 million versus our published indication of $580 million to $610 million for the quarter, this is about 20% better than our Q1 2023 volume of $565 million and an increase of about 85% from our Q2 2022 volume, not including the Sky Financial volume.Our Q2 North America acquiring business volume was $146 million, which is 30% higher than the first-quarter $112 million volume and is 77% higher than the same period one year earlier. Q2 Charge Savvy processing was $53 million, or about 19% lower than Q1 2023 processing volume. When compared to the $62 million volume in Q1 2022, it is a 15% decline. The year-over-year decline is due to reduced processing from select merchandise.For our FX and international payments portfolio, including the acquired Transact Europe business and our new banking-as-a-service offering, we processed $425 million in the second quarter compared to $344 million in business volume in Q1, an increase of over 23%. This is a 248% increase from Q2 of 2022 second's $121 million. For an update on American Samoa, we are now servicing about 60% of the target merchants' market for our plan. In Q2, our processing volume was about $31 million, or a 10% improvement from the prior quarter, and our monthly volume is sustaining at about $10 million.With respect to coyni, as Ben spoke to earlier, we continue to work towards executing our spin-off plans. We just announced the release of the coyni mPOS app that enables simple setup of point of sales terminal using compatible smartphones and users for convenient contactless payments. Furthermore, we discussed our near-term focus is on rolling out the platform in the European market due to the US regulatory environment and digital banking changes, as well as the increasing demand in the European market. Our efforts to establish the European business is well underway.Now I'd like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the total year. With respect to the processing volume in Q3, we are targeting a range of $720 million to $800 million. For the total year of 2023, without the Sky Financial volume, we are estimating a range of $3 billion to $4 billion. Given the strength of our Q2 revenue of $14.8 million and continuing momentum, we are raising our Q3 revenue outlook to $16 million to $18 million, which would bring our total year revenue to exceed $60 million.With regard to adjusted pro-forma EBITDA, our Q2 figure is a negative $0.9 million. This is lower than our targeted breakeven for the quarter, which is due to higher-than-planned expenses associated with cost scheme fees and administrative expenses to regain compliance. We are adjusting our 2023 target for this year, down from $4 million to a range of positive adjusted EBITDA of $2 million to $3 million, and our projection for Q3 is $1 million to $2 million.Overall, we remain optimistic about our growth trajectory domestically in the US and in the international markets, and as a result, expect to deliver great results.This concludes my remarks for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the call back over to Ben Errez, our Chairman, to begin our Q&amp;A.Ben ErrezThank you, Min. Operator, Please proceed with the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe will now begin our question --Ben ErrezHello.OperatorGo ahead, sir.Ben ErrezYeah. Thank you, operator. So before we take the questions from the floor, we had a few questions submitted to us by e-mail, and we will address those prior to the continued conversation online.The first question is the -- an update -- or pertains to an update on the matter of the Nasdaq minimum compliance and the update that we have for you all today is that the company has indeed regained compliance. And we had a continued conversation with the hearing panel following that. And the company is going to stay on a six months watch list. We will prepare shortly a simple 8-K announcing that, and we are planning to continue and maintain compliance.Question number two pertains to an update on how things are progressing with the latest announcement on financial partnership, including Visa and SEPA integration, and what our expectations moving forward. We did discuss some of that on the call.Min, I will turn to you should you want to provide further brief on that.Min WeiYeah. Thanks, Ben. I'd like to share exciting progress for both Visa Direct program and the SEPA program. The SEPA program -- the SEPA system is already working with our current system, being processed of the turn on and fully integrated with SEPA Instant. We expect that to commence in the third quarter, as a result of that, we should see further increase processing volume when it comes to business-as-a-service offering. We respect the Visa Direct program. We are working diligently with the Visa program manager. We target our live with an initial list of countries in the third quarter.As we mentioned during the press release, the great potential of this Visa Direct program is when it's fully up and running. We will have access to local payouts to over 80 countries with a large range of different foreign currencies. So all in all, great momentum for business-as-a-service offering. I mentioned also earlier during the call that we have seen further increasing volume for business-as-a-service portfolio we have. When we're looking at the monthly volume, we already constantly hitting north of $100 million (technical difficulty)And while we compare to the Q2 business-as-a-service offering to the previous quarter, we definitely have seen double-digit growth. So good news across the board, and we expect to see Visa Direct and SEPA Instant further help us (technical difficulty)Ben ErrezThank you, Min. The next question will be answered by the CEO Fredi Nisan. With PayPal launching Stablecoin and other digital currency project in the works such as FedNow, what are your thoughts on the competitive landscape? What's the strategy there to stay in the hunt or ahead of the game? Fredi, go ahead.Fredi NisanThank you, Ben. From PayPal announcing the Stablecoin, I think, is a great news for everybody, especially when we see big companies like PayPal joining the crypto and stablecoin technology space and offering. I think from regulation, it will help as well because we have a big company like PayPal pushing an agenda. So we'll have everybody in the space.From the FedNow and how all of that interact with the stablecoin, I think we need to understand that FedNow is just local payment just like ACH, and it will not help with in transfer money on a global scale. So the stablecoin is a little bit different, but from a competitive landscape, we see it as a good thing because we can later on maybe interact with PayPal. We're talking about global payment movement. So PayPal is a big player and I think it will help us and our business. But I want to mention as well that PayPal is in the low-risk space, and they don't touch the medium to high-risk. So I think we have a great opportunity with our technology and our offering, there's something that PayPal not necessarily can offer to their clients. So I see a great opportunity for all of us in that space. And again, it's just the beginning of it. So I'm very excited.Ben ErrezThanks, Fredi. I'll take the next question, a subject that is very close to my heart. Can you clarify as much as possible as to the timeline of the coyni spin-off and the related dividend?I very much like the dividend idea for all shareholders and we are diligently pursuing that opportunity and pushing it forward as quickly as we can. As it stands right now, we have acquired the launch vehicles for the coyni spin-off. We have filed articles of merger with the state of Nevada and have those approved. And we have filed for a name change and ticker change appropriately for coyni with FINRA and are awaiting the confirmation. We suspect that that will happen fairly shortly.With that on hand, we will go ahead and file the registration statement for the shares that are going to be used for the dividend. We anticipate that registration statement to be considered and approved by the SEC in a fairly short timeline, perhaps 30 to 60 days. Following that, we will announce the date of record for the dividend and take steps towards distributing that dividend. As we said on the call, we anticipate that to be completed by the end of the year.I will also take the next question. Does the company have any updates on pursuing the entitlements under the Sky Financial purchase agreement?So very quick update on that. We are pursuing that option for us. On the legal front, we're still looking through different strategies to maximize recovery under that liability. And as it stands right now, we don't have any further substantive updates to share with everybody, but we will obviously share all pertinent information as that comes about.Here's the next question, can you talk about the strategy to scale up into larger or bigger economies? Or is that the focus on maximizing opportunity in smaller economies and face less competition such as Bulgaria or Samoa, et cetera? Min, I'll hand you the baton to take a crack at that first.Min WeiThat's a great question. In terms of our growth strategy, we've been very selective. Rather than categorize into larger versus smaller economies, we'd rather look at our focus on specific verticals and geographics. For example, in the US, our block processing volumes growing -- continue to grow very robustly. We have seen more than 15% to 20% growth from Q1 to Q2. We expect to continue to focus on the verticals we serve today to achieve double-digit growth in the US market, focus on the specific verticals we target on.Separately, we are also looking at new verticals and new geographics where we have less competition, where we expect to generate higher profit margins. For example, our plan to roll out coyni in the European market, we'll focus on specific medium to high-risk, high-return verticals. We have a plan -- we're in the process of establishing the business entities, rolling out the product platform in the second half (technical difficulty) in the European market.In the US, we are also in the process of progressing the rollout of coyni services for e-commerce programs, for some additional wallet programs as well. So I would say, all in all, we focus on select verticals, we focus on select business portfolios that are going to generate good profit margins. As a result of that, we can generate better return for our shareholders.Ben ErrezThanks, Min. The next question will go to Fredi. Can you elaborate on the mPOS capabilities and how that's being marketed? Any estimate impact on financials and timing that you can provide? This follows a PR that we just released about this new product of ours. Fredi, go ahead.Fredi NisanThank you, Ben. The mPOS is an extension to coyni. We developed this product for internal understanding of what are the challenges that exist today in the market when you run a payment company. One of the biggest challenges are the hardware, the terminals, the time to deployment, the challenges when they arrive, set up. All of that time-consuming task are related to an older technology that related to merchant services called the POS, the actual terminal. We develop a new technology that you can turn any phone into that terminal as long as you accept coyni and you're part of the coyni merchant program. And that allows you to go live from the moment you get approved very quickly. You don't have to wait for a device to be shipped to you. You don't have to do downloads. You don't have to set it up.And we can deploy it globally with the same exact app. So we don't -- it does not require certain sophistication in different countries and it's allowing us to reduce operation costs, deployment costs, and other support that need to exist in a company like a payment processing company to allow to support that.So in the end of the day, the benefits are simple: faster deployment, help with global deployment, and help with cost-effective for merchants, meaning they don't need to buy a terminal; and the last thing will be to help us actually help them to support -- reduce fraud, charge back, give us visibility into the transaction, and give us the ability as well to get into a new vertical that may be considered today a little bit riskier. All of it together will allow us to increase volume, increase the profitability of the company on both sides, the operation and on the front for the commissions.Ben ErrezThanks, Fredi. Operator Drew, please proceed with the Q&amp;A and to the rest of the conversation.Operator(Operator Instructions) Kevin Dede, H.C. Wainwright.Michael DonovanThank you for taking my question, operator. This is Michael Donovan calling on behalf of Kevin Dede. So in your press release, you state that you expect to have a full global payment platform covering over 100 local currencies and local sediments. I want to clarify, is this going to be using Visa's network or will coyni also be handling multiple currencies, as well?Ben ErrezMin, I'll have you take that. It's part of your conversation.Min WeiNo problem. That's a very fair question. When we refer to the potential, obviously in the context of the press release, we refer to the Visa Direct Program. It is a very impressive coverage Visa offer outside of the conventional swift transfer, right? It's going to be faster. It's going to be cheaper for our business and consumer customers. But that's not to say that we don't process and interface with conventional programs. We do have full capability working with Swift, working with SEPA, we talked about earlier, and as well as Visa Direct.So in terms of coyni, yes, it is our plan. As I mentioned earlier, we have the coyni rollout plan covers both the US market as (technical difficulty) we're pushing the business processing capability for the European market, we fully expect with integrated banking solutions, with the coyni platform, we have the capability of handling the multi-currency in a kind of an expeditious processing way for our customers.Michael DonovanOkay, thank you, Min. And for coyni's mobile point-of-sale app, are you -- which specific geographical regions are you targeting in the beginning? And have you had feedback from merchants, right, already? I know it's been only a few days but get a little bit more color on that front, that'll be appreciated.Ben ErrezThanks, Michael. For that question, we're going back to Fredi.Fredi NisanMy apologies, guys, but my -- for some reason I can hear only a couple of sentences, so Ben, if you don't mind, repeat the question.Ben ErrezMichael --Michael DonovanCertainly. Yeah. Thanks, Fredi. So for coyni's mobile point-of-sale app, are there specific geographical regions that you're targeting in the beginning? And also, I know it's only been a few days, but have you received feedback from merchants already?Fredi NisanThank you for repeating the question. At the moment, we are focusing on the US. We do have a couple merchants that already kind of approached us and want to start utilizing that in a very specific vertical that we are comfortable with as well. But the next goal is, as we are deploying coyni as well in Europe, it will be deployed there in a few verticals that we believe we can be very successful. But at the moment, we start with the US.Michael DonovanThank you so much for that clarity. And for the regulatory landscape in the US, I know Ben touched upon this a bit, but how are things changing in the US? What's your take on the stable regulatory bill that's going through the House right now?Ben ErrezThat's a -- I'll take this one. So that's an interesting topic. And Michael, you and Kevin have been persistent on that front much more than what we see centrally from the government and from the Federal Reserve. The FedNow initiative declared the pilot program back in 2020. At the time, 1% of all financial institutions around the country, and there are about 10,000 of those, were signed up to participate in this pilot program, so about 100.Back in April of this year, the certification program was announced for FedNow. And the certificates were awarded in July of this year. Out of the 100 or so participants, only 41, as of now, are certified. And a big portion of that are not standard financial institutions. They are more service providers. And by the way, the government includes itself as one of those successful completions of this course. The harsh reality is that this landscape is very challenging in the US. The world is not waiting for us to figure it out.This is part of the reason why coyni spin-off is primarily targeting operations in Europe, where the landscape is maybe a lot more competitive, but a lot more finite. The regulators have already established the playing field. Everybody understands it. Banks are participating in very large quantities, and penetration is sort of defined.So I guess this is a longer answer to a short question, but I think it gives you a little bit of a flavor of where we're going with all of this.Michael DonovanThat's certainly quite helpful. And that's all I have for today. I appreciate your time, Ben, Min, Fredi, and Gene. I'll hop back in the queue.OperatorI would like to go back to Ben Errez for closing remarks.Ben ErrezSo I'd like to thank everyone for participating on this conversation and signing up to listen to our quarterly results. As we stated in the beginning of the conversation, the entire remark sections were produced using AI, I think very effectively, and we will continue to use this technology moving forward. Looking forward to our next call with you all. The shareholder meeting is coming up in the end of October, and hopefully, at that point, we will have further clarity on the dividend outlay for everybody. With this, I thank you all, and we'll see you next time.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect.]"

PeoplesThanks, Lynne. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Let's turn to Slide 3. I'm pleased to report that we are making solid progress across the business as we operationalize our commercial plan to launch Camelina as a platform crop with a focus on higher fuel feedstock markets and high-value market for omega-3 oils.Today, we'll provide an update on our business, including recent accomplishments, the market opportunity and trends driving the biofuel market; our progress developing herbicide-tolerant Camelina varieties; our plan to scale up EPA omega-3 Camelina; we'll present second quarter financials; and summarize key milestones. We will then open the call to questions.Let's turn to Slide 4 for progress on key 2023 business goals. Our main goal in 2023 is to establish and demonstrate the value chain from Yield10 seed to commercial offtake products. I'm pleased to report that based on recent activities in the business, we are right on track executing against this goal. The value chain for Camelina in the biofuels market starts with seed genetics and quality seed production. The next step is building relationships with growers in the target-growing regions and signing up to grow Camelina under contract. The third step is to line up grain offtake customers to buy the Camelina grain for their crushing and biofuel operations. We have now demonstrated each of the steps in this value chain. Starting with the winter Camelina we contracted last year, we signed contracts and guided the growers through planting and harvest. One farm located in Southern Alberta redirected delivery of the harvested Camelina to our regional biofuel partner, where the first crusher of the Camelina grain has occurred, and the conversion to biofuel is imminent. The photos on the right side of the slide show the harvest of winter Camelina grown in Southern Alberta and the delivery of the Camelina grain to an offtake customer. This represents a key milestone for Yield10 demonstrating the full value chain.On the business development side, our team continues to engage with potential supply chain partners, including ongoing discussions with Marathon Petroleum and Mitsubishi for investment in offtake agreements for Camelina production in specified growing regions. Outside of the scope of these discussions, we have continued to respond to additional inbound inquiries from energy company partner prospects with the goal of creating the option to establish a network of alliances to supply family in the feedstock aisle to the biofuel market.Let's now turn to Slide 5. Camelina as a platform crop. Our business plan is based on leveraging Camelina as a platform crop for producing oil, meal and specialty products. We believe that by leveraging the demand created by biofuels and our advanced technology capabilities, we can transition Camelina from a niche crop into a major crop planting in more than 30 million acres a year in North America.This won't be achieved overnight. While there are key attributes of Camelina that could drive the ramp-up in acres. For example, Camelina can be planted, harvested, stored and processed on existing equipment on farm and at the processors. Next, another big driver of adoption is that we are bringing forward not only spring varieties but winter varieties of Camelina. Our winter varieties are proving to be extremely cold tolerant and drought resistant. With time, winter Camelina has potential for seamless integration into crop rotations with corn and soy. Here, we would plan Camelina as a winter cover crop in the fall after corn harvest and harvest late spring before planting soybean. I'll mention that in June, the USDA has stepped up and indicated they are offering crop insurance for Camelina in many states.Let's now turn to Slide 6. The business model and markets for Camelina oil and meal. We are using a closed-loop contracted grain production model to produce Camelina oil for the biofuel market. Camelina grain is comprised of about 35% to 40% oil, and the protein meal over 55% and basically the rest of the seed. This is the core product for oil extraction. Camelina oil has captured the attention of the renewable energy space because of its attractive composition and profile. It has a very low-carbon index, and its fatty acid profile is well suited for making renewable diesel and SAF. Camelina protein meal is approved for use in animal feed, representing an essential market and revenue stream for gas.Now let's turn to Slide 7, the biofuel opportunity. There's tremendous opportunity in the biofuel market for vegetable oils processed into sustainable aviation fuel, SAF, and renewable diesel. New demand is being generated as new refineries are coming online. And this new environmental commitments are being made to utilize these cleaner fuels across the globe.Biofuel players face 2 major sources of risk: volatility in pricing and availability of feedstock oils; and volatility in the regulatory environment, which, among other things, can impact the incentives for biofuel adoption. For example, we are already seeing states like Illinois place limits on the amount of soybean oil that could be used for SAF. Above which, the tax breaks no longer apply.Camelina cultivation could address key aspects of risk for biofuel producers by expanding the overall supply of feedstock oil, especially using winter Camelina. Growing Camelina on otherwise fallow land either winter or summer can increase both feedstock oil for fuel and brings with it a new source of high protein meal.Let's now go to Slide 8, establishing production under early varieties. Our team has developed spring and winter Camelina varieties that have enabled us to establish production in the value chain. WDH2, shown in the center of the slide, is a winter variety with robust cold tolerance. WDH3 is an early maturing winter variety, and E3902 is our genome-edited spring variety. The development of these 3 varieties enabled Yield10 to begin the commercial launch with proprietary seed genetics, while we accelerate the development of our advanced varieties with elite herbicide technology for commercial launch in the future.Let's now turn to Slide 9, grain production and offtake. Last fall, beginning in September '22, we contracted with growers to plant WDH2 in plant plots ranging from 30 to 160 acres. This contracting was done to set in motion steps in the value chain from planting to harvest to grain delivery to an offtake customer. Photos on this slide illustrate the steps of the value chain we have up and running in Western Canada. Our team contracted spring family of acres for plant in May, and we expect harvest to be completed in the coming weeks. In third quarter, we are engaging with existing and new growers and seeing good interest in contracting winter acres in the '23-'24 growing season.I'll now turn the call over to Kristi for an update on the development of next-generation seed genetics, particularly HT and stacked HT Camelina varieties.Kristi D. SnellThanks, Oli, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. Growers need weed control to reduce competition for nutrients and increase the productivity of their crops. Our vision is to provide farmers with high-yielding elite Camelina varieties with herbicide tolerance traits that are compatible with farmers' crop rotations. Incorporation of herbicide tolerance traits in canola transformed it from a marginal crop to a major crop grown on millions of acres, and we believe Camelina may follow a similar path.Herbicide-tolerant lines of winter Camelina are particularly intriguing in that they could provide growers with a new crop rotation, a cover crop that increases grower revenue, protects soil health and reduces nutrient runoff, all while producing a feedstock that can be used to produce a low CI oil for biofuels.Yield10 has also made progress in increasing the harvest value of Camelina with programs to enter near traits for increased seed yield and oil content, improved protein mill value and future higher value seed products such as omega-3 oils and PHAs. Yield10's technology development has resulted in a patent portfolio that includes 21 patent applications issued or pending.Let's now turn to Slide 11. We have developed spring and winter lines at Camelina that have tolerance to an over-the-top spray of a broadleaf herbicide that is routinely used on major food crops. The chart on this slide shows progress towards achieving milestones to enable commercialization of our first herbicide-tolerant Camelina variety. We are making good progress on late-stage field trials and are waiting to hear back from USDA-APHIS on regulatory filings for deregulated growth of the crop and from the Environmental Protection Agency to add Camelina to the herbicide label. We have also initiated field work in 2023 to obtain seed samples for compositional analysis to support use of the seed meal for animal feed. We are also scaling up seed for commercial planning and are on track for 2025 commercial launch of spring Camelina with tolerance to the broadleaf herbicide.Let's now turn to Slide 12. We're also making good progress with stacked herbicide tolerance, which is the combined traits of tolerance to over-the-top applications of a broadleaf herbicide for weed control, combined with tolerance to group 2 soil residues to achieve broader acreage. We recently reported encouraging data out of our ongoing spring 2023 field trial. We demonstrated robust stacked herbicide tolerance in multiple events. The photos show examples of events with stacked herbicide tolerance with little or no growth of control plants without the trait. We have initiated regulatory work with these lines and have filed a regulatory status review, or RSR, with USDA-APHIS to deregulate the growth with Camelina with the stacked trait.Going forward, we will harvest the field trials, measure seed yield and seed oil content and choose to best lead and backup events to move forward in our pipeline. The lead event will be chosen based on robustness of the herbicide tolerance as well as seed yield, seed oil content and overall agronomics of the event.Seed from the lines will be scaled up in the winter 2023-2024 contra season. We believe that the stacked herbicide tolerance lines will be a win-win for growers and Yield 10 since the trait will allow robust weed control for farmers, increasing yield and revenue and tolerance to previously used Group 2 herbicides, allowing broad expansion of acres available for planting Camelina.As I wrap up, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Yield10 technology team that have enabled Yield10 to develop and employ cutting-edge technology to position Camelina as a competitive crop for production of feedstock oils for biofuels. This technology package will also be used as the basis for the high-level production of omega-3 oils and elite Camelina background and the production of PHA bioplastics.In the coming months ahead, we look forward to further field testing our best commercial quality herbicide-tolerant Camelina line as well as advancing the omega-3 oil technology platform and securing regulatory clearances for our elite Camelina products.I'll now hand the call back to Oli.Oliver P. PeoplesThanks, Kristi. Now let's turn to Slide 13 for an update on omega-3. The omega-3 oils containing EPA and DHA fatty acids represent a very exciting market opportunity. Unlike the biofuel market where we will sell grain to an offtake customer, this is a place where it will be possible to market the oil directly to end users.Our business strategy was set up to leverage the advanced Camelina varieties including HT and operating foundation established for biofuels to build their business in the omega-3 oils. We believe that Camelina will be an ideal platform crop for making these omega-3 oils. We are conducting our work in omega-3 oils in collaboration with Rothamsted Research in the U.K. The team at Rothamsted developed the EPA8 Camelina line that produces up to 29% EPA in oil, depending on the background variety of Camelina used. The EPA level in this oil is 2 to 3x out of fish oil. So we believe this can be developed as a preferred higher value source of purified EPA products, such as ethyl EPA from the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical markets. They have also developed and extensively tested the DHA1 Camelina line which contains 10% EPA and 10% DHA in the oil. Published aquafeed studies have shown that the DHA1 oil can serve as a drop-in replacement for fish oil. Clinical studies also published have shown this oil to be an effective alternative to fish oil in the human diet. Next-generation Camelina lines with further improvements to the composition are also being progressed by Rothamsted with funding support from Yield10. In July, we filed a request for regulatory status for Yield and RSR with USDA-APHIS as a key step in the regulatory path for omega-3 EPA Camelina. We're currently developing a detailed plan for the commercial launch of this business. Let's now turn to Slide 14, the market opportunity for omega-3. Both new challenges and drivers for new sources of the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, both essential for human health and wellness, continue to emerge. Consumption of oily fish in salmon are the main sources of EPA and DHA fatty acids in the diet. There is tremendous pressure on the harvest of fish such as anchovies because it is proving to be unsustainable as natural fish stocks are dipping currently. In fact, the anchovy harvest in Peru was canceled in 2023 due to low fish stocks. Peruvian anchovy account to around 20% of global fish oil, so we expect this to have a significant additional impact on fish oil pricing near term, and in addition, result in increased in third-party interest in alternate resources like the Camelina omega-3 platform.We know that regulatory hurdles are also being reduced. Norway, the largest producer of farmed salmon until recently, had a moratorium on the use of GMO ingredients in aquafeed. But recently approved the use of a GMO omega-3 oil from Nuseed. They produce a DHA-containing oil in canola. Using the RSR process for regulatory approval by USDA-APHIS under the secure role, we see a clear path to production of omega-3 in the U.S. Chuck, over to you.Charles B. HaaserThanks, Oli, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 15. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $2.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. During Q2, we added $1 million to our cash position as a result of issuing a senior unsecured convertible note in Marathon Petroleum. This was in connection with the LOI we signed with them. So we raised an additional $2.7 million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering in May. In addition, last week, we priced a $3.7 million public offering of units consisting of common shares and warrants. We expect that our cash on hand, including proceeds from these offerings, will support our operations into the fourth quarter of this year. Our net operating cash used for operating activities was $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2022. And for the full year 2023, we continue to expect total net cash usage in the range of $12.5 million to $13 million to fund our operations, including payments to growers for our first Camelina grain harvest. During our third and fourth quarters of 2023, we also expect to report our first Camelina product revenues from Camelina grain and sales to our biofuel offtake customers.Let's now review the second quarter and year-to-date 2023 operating results. For the second quarter of 2023, the company reported a net loss of $3.7 million or $0.64 per share as compared to a net loss of $3.4 million or $0.70 a share for the second quarter of the previous year. As expected, due to the completion of our Department of Energy grant during our first quarter of 2023, we did not report grant revenue for the second quarter of this year. We reported $0.1 million in grant revenue in the second quarter of last year.R&amp;D expenses during the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 were consistent at $2 million, and G&amp;A expenses were $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, the company reported a net loss of $7.5 million or $1.39 per share compared to a net loss of $6.8 million or $1.38 per share during the 6 months of -- ended June 30, 2022. Year-to-date, grant revenue from the completed DOE grant were $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Research and development expenses were $4.2 million and $3.8 million during the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, respectively. And general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million and $3.2 million during each of those periods. For more details on our financial results, please refer to our earnings release. Oli, back to you.Oliver P. PeoplesThanks, Chuck. Let's now turn to Slide 16 for upcoming milestones. But before getting into the upcoming milestones, I'd like to comment on the tremendous progress made by the Yield10 teams here in Massachusetts and in Canada. It's not easy for a small organization to make the transition from an R&amp;D focused to commercial activities with the added pressure of needing to demonstrate compelling capabilities on both to prospective strategic partners. No surprise then that I'm extremely proud of the Yield10 team and what we have accomplished already this year. Biofuel partner agreements progressing with Marathon Petroleum and Mitsubishi; additional biofuel partnership discussions ongoing with other oil majors and regional energy players; winter Camelina grain production and contracting fall of 2022 and close to fully harvested with some already delivered to our offtake partner; spring Camelina production completed with harvest coming shortly. Finally, on the regulatory approval for omega-3 Camelina line EPA8, and achieving key milestones in developing HT and very recently stacked HT Camelina in field trials.Building on these accomplishments, we are working towards a number of key milestones in the second half of '23 and into the first half of 2024, including first grain product revenue, a big milestone for us; working with Marathon and Mitsubishi to finalize investment in offtake agreements; continue to progress partnerships with undisclosed third-party partner prospects interested in biofuel feedstocks; contracting winter Camelina production with doors for planting this fall as we continue to make progress introducing the benefits of growing Camelina as a winter crop and expand our grower network; building seed inventory of current and HT and stacked HT varieties for future growth contracts; developing and progressing the commercial launch of Camelina omega-3 oils; and continuing business development outreach to prospective partners across our seed product areas with the goal of executing strategic industry collaborations; and we'll continue to work on expanding our intellectual property portfolio. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynne for questions.Lynne H. BrumThanks, Oli. Melissa, we're ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.Anthony V. VendettiYes, I just wanted to get an update first on the agreements. I know the LOI with Marathon Petroleum and then the MOUs with Mitsubishi and American Airlines. I was just wondering where those are at in terms of moving to definitive agreements. And then I have some follow-up questions.Oliver P. PeoplesYes, regarding -- I mean, obviously, with Marathon, I mean there's a time line associated with that LOI, which basically, I think, expires in -- from the point of view of certain provisions in basically August 25, I believe it is. And so although it doesn't mean that conversations will be over by then, that's when their exclusivity does run out. So obviously, we've been working very closely with Marathon over the last 3 months basically to structure the agreements, basically an agreement which already defined most of the parameters. I can't disclose those as they're not public, but we basically involve 2 agreements: one would be an investment agreement; the second would be an offtake agreement.Regarding Mitsubishi, we made progress with Mitsubishi and their partner, ENEOS, which is the refined -- major refiner, largest refinery in Japan. We are also progressing pretty much along similar lines. We, again, haven't disclosed the specifics of that, but certainly, we also anticipate 2 similar agreements, basically an investment agreement and a strategic offtake agreement for Camelina oil for the biofuel market.And so with American Airlines, that's really more of a collaboration. American, as an airline, and obviously, when you look at the potential demand for SAF, 3 billion gallons for 2030 and 35 billion gallons in the U.S. for SAF by 2050. And then you look internationally, the 13.6 billion gallons from Europe and another 6 billion gallons demand from Japan, and certainly, the airlines who are really going to be pretty much dependent on SAF as a major source of reducing their carbon emissions, SAF is obviously very strategic to them. And so we continue to work with American Airlines as they help to support us to help develop this value chain. But Marathon -- not Marathon. Essentially, American Airlines is not going to be an offtake partner or a refiner. Essentially, we have a strategic interest in seeing this industry expanding, particularly the availability of low CI and nonfood feedstocks.Anthony V. VendettiOkay. No, that's helpful, Oli. And then just to clarify on Marathon Petroleum, they have until August 25, so 11 days from now, to make a decision? Or the exclusivity with them lapses and you could strike a deal with another company if you so desire, is that correct?Oliver P. PeoplesWell, let's be clear. I'm not going to get into that specifically. What I can say is that we are working very closely with Marathon to bring this to a positive conclusion. Within the constraints of the Marathon agreement, we are in discussions with other parties, including Mitsubishi and some others in areas that are not constrained by that agreement, but I'm not going to provide any specifics on that.Anthony V. VendettiOkay. That makes sense. Okay. So you did say, though, by the end of this year, you'll be producing revenues from the Camelina grain. Can you...Oliver P. PeoplesThat's correct.Anthony V. VendettiCorrect? Correct. Okay. Can you talk about where you're at with the commercialization process for the herbicide-tolerant Camelina and the interest from the farmers?Oliver P. PeoplesI think -- so I can talk to you about the interest from the farmers very specifically. And obviously, on the technology front, you've heard from Kristi's excellent presentation that stuff. And a great job on her team obviously, not only progressing the herbicide tolerance for weed control, but the very rapid development and demonstration of field trials of the stacked herbicide technology, and we can talk to the merits of both of those.So fundamentally, what we hear from growers is we're very interested in this crop. We see tremendous potential for it. What are you going to do about weed control because we need to have weed control in order to seamlessly integrate this into our crop rotations so that we can grow this without having any negative impact on the other crops that we grow. So that's number one.Number two is in all of these areas, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, all the way down through Kansas, down into Texas, they use a lot of these group 2 herbicides. And so the industry has this thing called a planned backdate. So if you've used the group 2 herbicide on various plots of your land or sections of your land, as they call it, basically, there are restrictions on what you could plant on that land soon thereafter. And sometimes for group 2, it's going to be a few months to as much as a year or even longer. And so that has a major -- what it does is it reduces the number of acres each grower has available potentially planting winter Camelina or even spring Camelina for that matter.So by having the stacked HT that has tolerance to those residues, in addition to the weed control, we're just -- quite frankly, we're making this idiot proof for the grower to adopt this in a very large scale. And certainly, the conversations we have with growers indicate that they are very excited about that.Operator(Operator Instructions) At this time, I'm seeing no other questions. Ms. Brum, I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments.Lynne H. BrumGreat. Thanks, Melissa, and I'll turn the call back to Oli.Oliver P. PeoplesSo I'd like to thank you. I personally thank all of you for joining us on the call today and especially our shareholders for your continued support. I want to thank everyone at Yield10 for contributions that are keeping us on track to our commercial and product development goals. Have a nice evening, everyone.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

That's a faster pace than the week-on-week drop of 25.9% for the period ending June 17.Bud Light volumes crashed 29.7%, accelerating from the week earlier's plunge of 29.3%.""Recent data continues to show that tracked channels reached a point of stabilization at significantly lower levels for Anheuser-Busch InBev than pre-controversy,"" Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein wrote in a note.The declines started after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney created an Instagram post during the March Madness basketball tournament endorsing the light beer.Following the post on April 1, ABInBev saw Bud Light sales trend lower through April. The declines appeared to accelerate following an April 3 video from country musician Kid Rock, which spurred a wider boycott by many on the right.To try and stem the sales weakness, Budweiser offered US consumers in most states a rebate of up to $15 on a 15-pack or larger for July 4. The company has also reportedly been discounting Bud Light at retailers since the July 4 promotion.Empty Bud Light cans sit in the seats during the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Guardians game on May 31, 2023, in Baltimore, Maryland. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) (Rob Carr via Getty Images)By all indications, the gambit hasn't paid off.The sales pressure has stretched well into the peak summer drinking months as the uproar has continued to play out on social media and in national headlines.And there are two things making matters worse for Anheuser-Busch InBev.First, rival Heineken is actively courting disenchanted Bud Light consumers.A Heineken spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Finance that it will spend $100 million to market a new light beer called Heineken Silver to consumers. The company plans to give away two million free samples this year as part of that initiative.And secondly, the controversy continues to weigh on the rest of the beer giant's portfolio.Story continuesFor the week ending August 5, Michelob Ultra volumes fell by 2.9% and Busch Light declined by 7.3%. Both were accelerated declines from the prior week.

Iron-based batteries typically do not store as much energy, however.LFP battery cells were developed in the United States, but Chinese companies such as BYD and CATL currently dominate global production.The new funding round for Mitra Chem “is a strategic investment that will further help reinforce GM’s efforts in EV batteries (and) accelerate our work on affordable battery chemistries like LMFP,” said Gil Golan, GM vice president of technology acceleration and commercialization.The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act “is one of the main drivers” in GM’s efforts with Mitra Chem and others to build a U.S.-based supply chain for LFP batteries and next-generation materials, Golan said.The IRA provides incentives for battery materials, components, cells and packs that are sourced in North America.Golan said batteries made from iron-rich materials developed with Mitra Chem could appear in some GM vehicles in the second half of the decade. He said GM already uses LFP batteries in its electric vehicles in China.GM’s Ultium batteries now use cells with nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum cathodes, which store more energy and enable longer driving range than LFP cells, but are more expensive.Story continuesThe automaker has indicated its Ultium joint-venture battery plants with partner LG Chem in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan will produce cells with NCMA cathodes, while a fourth U.S. plant with Samsung SDI will make “nickel-rich” battery cells.The basic ingredients in LFP and LMFP cathodes are relatively more abundant than nickel and cobalt and tend to be less volatile, battery experts say.Mitra Chem was cofounded by Vivas Kumar, chief executive officer; Will Chueh, chief scientific adviser, and Chirranjeevi Gopal, chief product officer.

It is known as the “buy high and sell higher” theory. Without a doubt, it’s a fruitful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like General Motors, NVR and CVR Energy have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.only 20.Here are three of the 20 stocks:Story continuesGeneral Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers. GM has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for GM is 22.6%, on average.NVR is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings.

The company had a production capacity of 820,000 units in the first half of this year.The South Korean firm said it intends to upgrade the existing infrastructure at the Talegaon unit and start manufacturing in 2025. The plant currently has an annual production capacity of 130,000 units.Hyundai, India's second-biggest carmaker by sales, did not mention a deal value.This deal will allow the U.S. automaker to exit India. GM stopped selling cars in the country in 2017 after years of dwindling sales but its complete exit from the market has been marred by complications, including legal tussles with workers and failure to find a buyer for the plant.In 2019, GM agreed to sell the plant to China's Great Wall Motor but talks collapsed after the companies failed to obtain regulatory approvals amid New Delhi's scrutiny of Chinese investments.Last week, Hyundaisaidit plans to launch more electric vehicles (EVs) under the Hyundai and Kia brands in India, in a sign that it is betting big on the world's third-largest auto market.It plans toinvest$2.45 billion to beef up EV production in the country and is bullish on the local appetite for EVs.(Reporting by Ashish Chandra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonia Cheema)]"

200,fce645bf-ac33-3792-8ae4-bb4ba7ad476e,MKC,2023-08-16,Kellogg (K) Poised on Brand Portfolio Strength & Buyouts,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kellogg-k-poised-brand-portfolio-130400766.html,1692104640,STORY,"['K', 'MKC-V', 'HRL', 'KHC']","[Kellogg Company K has been gaining from strength in its brand portfolio, fueled by measures to boost innovation. The convenience food maker has been expanding its business through acquisitions.The factors mentioned above benefited Kellogg’s second-quarter 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year. Management recently raised its 2023 sales and profit view because of solid first-half results and robust trends.Let’s delve deeper.Solid Q2 Results, Raised ViewIn the second quarter of 2023, Kellogg reported adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share, which increased by 6%. The company recorded net sales of $4,041 million, advancing 4.6%, backed by favorable price/mix and continued snack momentum. Organic net sales (excluding the currency impact) increased 7%.For 2023, management expects organic net sales growth to be up nearly 7% compared with the earlier guidance of 6-7% growth. The revised outlook reflects solid first-half results, price/mix growth and a gradual increase in price elasticities. The adjusted operating profit is expected to rise 9-10% at constant currency, up from the earlier guidance of 8-10% growth. The outlook reflects efforts toward profit-margin recovery.Factors Working in Kellogg’s FavorKellogg’s portfolio consists of strong brands such as Pringles, RXBAR, Bear Naked, Cheez-It, and Rice Krispies Treats, among many others. The company’s frozen foods brands, like Morningstar Farms and Eggo, have been aiding growth. On its second-quarter earnings call, management highlighted that Pringles's brand outperformed the salty snacks category.Kellogg is dedicated to augmenting its portfolio by adding more products under existing brands, innovation and marketing initiatives. The company has been focused on investing in brand-building efforts. In this respect, it invests in digital media, consumer promotions and traditional advertising. Kellogg has also been enhancing its in-store capabilities, like increasing the sales force of its struggling businesses.Kellogg acquired protein bar maker Chicago Bar Company in 2017. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, considered one of the fastest-growing nutrition bar brands in the United States. The company’s Pringle's buyout has been lucrative. With the Pringles deal, Kellogg transformed itself from a large U.S. snacks business to a true global snacks player. Kellogg also continues to expand its acquired brands through new product introductions.Story continuesSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, HRL announced its acquisition of a minority stake in Indonesia-based food and beverage company PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk. The move is likely to help Hormel Foods expand its presence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. In June 2021, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz.McCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Wrapping UpKellogg has been seeing the adverse impacts of high input cost inflation and economy-wide hurdles and shortages to some extent. The company has been grappling with rising SG&amp;A expenses for a while now. As the company has resumed meetings and travel with businesses returning to pre-pandemic levels, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to remain elevated.The company is on track with effective revenue growth management and productivity actions to counter the rising inflationary environment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Kashkari said the current proposal to raise the requirements for large banks ""is a step in the right direction,"" but that it ""doesn't go far enough."" Yahoo Finance Live looks at how regional bank stocks are reacting to Kashkari's comments.Video Transcript- Akiko, let's take a look at regional banks because we're also seeing some movement there those stocks under pressure today falling into the red after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned that the banking crisis may not be over. He also went on to say that proposals for stricter capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets doesn't go far enough. So we're seeing some of those jitters across the board when it comes to some of those regional plays.Kashkari, the fact that he was saying that we do see higher rates. He didn't commit. He didn't say we necessarily need another rate hike here from the Fed. But he did say if we do see another rate hike, that is what could cause a little bit more distress and a little bit more concern within some of these smaller lenders.- Yeah. When you talk about the path of rate hikes, so what he essentially said is we're a long ways away from a rate cut. That's as far as the commitment went. But going back to what we've been hearing on regional banks, he's referring to, of course, the proposal that came out from regulators for additional capital requirements.We're talking about midsized regional banks. It would be about 5% additional requirements there. And Kashkari's direct words here. He says the risk is that if inflation is not completely under control, that we have to raise rates further from there to bring it down. That they, as in the regional banks, might face more losses than they currently face today. And those pressures could flare up again in the future.Now this, of course, came on the back of a headline we got this morning about Fitch warning they may have to downgrade the credit rating of some of the larger banks as well. But certainly, any time you hear about concerns about those capital requirements, certainly things flaring up even months after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.- Yeah, certainly. We're seeing those jitters are reflected in the stock prices today.]"

""Some of the changes we'll make to our heritage month collections going forward will look like this: We'll have a slightly more focused assortment and will evolve our store and digital presentations, and we're going to reconsider the mix of our own national brands with our external partners.

These entities made claims that Target was marketing the products to children.The company's decision in late May to remove some of the LGBTQ-themed merchandise after customer backlash fueled by the conservative messaging triggered even more global backlash across social media.Target execs on the media call said there were incidents of shoppers threatening staff and destroying Pride-themed merchandise and displays. The uproar hurt second quarter sales, Target said.Cornell added on the call that once Target addressed the assortment, sales trends gradually began to improve.""Looking forward, we'll continue to celebrate Pride and other heritage moments, which are just one part of our commitment to support diverse teams and guests,"" Cornell explained. ""However, as we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're applying what we learned to ensure we're staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target.""Story continuesDespite the course correction mid-quarter, Target had a challenging three months.Second quarter comparable sales fell 5.4% from a year ago.The discounter slashed its full-year profit outlook on Tuesday, warning that general economic malaise, rising interest rates, and uncertainty from the restart of student loan repayments in a few weeks may continue to take their collective toll.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

It also expects sales will decline for the remainder of the year. In lowering its forecast, Target also cited the end of the student loan moratorium, which had provided one-time college students a little more financial breathing room.Profit for the fiscal second quarter came in above expectations, however, as Target brought inventories closer in line with cautionary spending on discretionary items by customers.Shares rose 3% Wednesday despite trimming profit expectations for the year.Target is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and the impact of rising prices and elevated interest on its customers will get a lot of attention ahead of a raft of quarterly reports from companies like Walmart other retailers.CEO Brian Cornell said higher high prices for food and household essentials are taking a bigger chunk out of the paychecks of customers, who have also pulled back on buying some goods in favor of travel or spending time out of the house in other ways.“Guests are out at concerts,” Cornell told reporters on a media call Tuesday. “They’re going to movies. They’ve seen ‘Barbie.' They’re enjoying those experiential moments, and they’re shopping very carefully for discretionary goods.”Other retailers are seeing the same thing.Home Depot, the nation’s largest home improvement retailer, said Tuesday that sales continued to decline after surging in recent years. Sales of big-ticket items, those that may require financing, were particularly hard hit.Story continuesIndustry analysts will be eager to see if the same forces are impacting other retailers reporting earnings this week, including Walmart, the nation’s largest, on Thursday. Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom post quarterly results later this month.This week, the U.S. reported that Americans increased their spending last month, but higher interest rates are weighing on economic activities that are highly dependent on credit, like sales of homes, vehicles, furniture and electronics.Target is more vulnerable than other big box discounters like Walmart. More than 50% of Target's annual sales come from discretionary items like toys, fashion and electronic gadgets, according to the company's latest annual financial report.Target also faced a unique problem during the most recent quarter, becoming one of the companies that was targeted for its LGBTQ+ support, in particular, its displays of Pride Month merchandise. It pulled some items in particular regions and made other changes after encountering hostility from some customers who confronted workers and tipped over displays. Company executives said this week that it couldn't tease out how much the negative reaction had on its business, but once it made the changes, those incidents subsided. Overall sales improved in July from June.Cornell said the company has learned from the backlash and that it will be more thoughtful in merchandise offerings for its heritage months, which celebrate various ethnic and marginalized groups. Target said it will have a slightly more focused assortment and will reconsider the mix of its own and national brands with its external partners.“We’ll continue to celebrate Pride and other heritage moments, which are just one part of our commitment to support a diverse teams and guests, ” Cornell told reporters. “However, as we navigate an ever changing operating and social environment, we’re applying what we’ve learned to ensure we’re staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target.”Target earned $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the quarter that ended July 29. That compares with $183 million, or 39 cent per share, in the year-ago period.Sales fell nearly 5% to $24.77 billion as shoppers focused more on groceries than discretionary items. Business in the quarter was also hurt because results were being compared with heavy discounting in the year-ago period that was meant to clear unwanted inventory as shoppers pulled back.Analysts had been expecting profits of $1.43 per share on sales of $25.18 billion, according to FactSet.Inventory at the end of the second quarter was 17% lower than last year, reflecting a 25% reduction in discretionary categories like fashion and home furnishings.Comparable sales — those from stores or digital channels operating for the past 12 months — fell 5.4% in the latest quarter. In the fiscal first quarter, sales were unchanged.Target now expects comparable sales in a wide range around a mid-single digit decline for the remainder of the year. It also now projects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $7 to $8, compared with the prior range of $7.75 to $8.75. Analysts were expecting $7.72 per share for the year, according to FactSet.Target's shares closed up at $128.75._____Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio]"

Investors are expecting a F2Q miss and guide-down for the second half. What is not yet known is how conservative the outlook will be, and if the Street will take a reasonable look for any potential EPS recovery in 2024. With sentiment widely negative and a miss/lower expected we believe it is too late to short Target stock. That said, with a material guide down likely we also believe it is too soon to jump into the name."" -Greg Melich, Evercore ISI""Today, we believe Target sits at the center of a number of consumer headwinds. With 51% of its sales derived from discretionary categories (apparel, hardlines, and home), 49% derived from more consumable categories (which are facing disinflation), accelerating share of wallet reversion occurring, and student loans potentially coming due, we see the risk of downward earnings revisions rising. The company was already losing market share and we fear that these headwinds might not abate as we look to the back-to-school and holiday seasons in second half."" -Chris Horvers, JPMorganBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The study's findings further underline the growing need to simplify payment methods for commuters.(PRNewsfoto/Visa)Public transportation accounts for nearly 70 per cent of urban passenger trips in Asia Pacific.[2] As urban populations continue to grow, the public transportation sector faces a pressing need to adapt to the evolving needs and payment preferences of commuters. For many unbanked households, public transit is an essential service for their transport needs – however, many consumers struggle with the payment methods available.According to this year's study, which surveyed commuters across four Asia Pacific markets including Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore, 96 per cent of respondents expect public transport providers to offer contactless payment methods, with 65 per cent of respondents likely to use a contactless payment option for their public transport needs. These options include contactless debit, credit or prepaid cards. Benefits cited for leveraging contactless payments include convenience, having less worry over carrying enough or exact cash, and a guarantee of the best possible fare through fare capping limits.""The study reveals a strong demand among commuters in Asia Pacific for seamless and convenient payment options in public transportation,"" said T.R. Ramachandran, Head of Products and Solutions, Asia Pacific, Visa. ""At Visa, we continue to work closely with governments and transport operators to offer a unified payment experience that accommodates a wide range of payment methods to boost urban mobility by focusing on customer convenience.  We aim to provide a streamlined system for payments, benefitting both commuters and the transportation ecosystem as a whole.""Story continuesHalf of commuters (45%) will also use public transport on a more frequent basis if their journeys are fare-capped, the study shows. Contactless payments guarantee exact fares for transit riders as opposed to other methods such as cash. Fare capping also limits how much a commuter pays for their total rides in a day, week or month, eliminating the need to tie up funds on a monthly pass or transit-dedicated card.""The benefits of contactless payment options on public transport extend beyond minimising friction for consumer payments – they are also an integral piece in driving broader financial inclusion,"" Ramachandran said. ""Digital payment methods for public transport plays a key role in supporting underbanked and unbanked individuals, for which public transport remains a necessity for commutes to work or to school. As a leader in digital payments, Visa is committed to ensuring inclusivity in the urban mobility ecosystem through accessible financial solutions.""Transforming commuter experiences with Mobility-as-a-Service capabilitiesAs the public transportation sector looks to implement Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) solutions to better improve urban mobility, key challenges such as data management and interoperability between digital payments remain. To meet these challenges, Visa has developed a comprehensive range of solutions that integrate the way people prefer to pay across their preferred public transport modes.Visa has also worked with governments, transport authorities and private companies to provide MaaS solutions and has since launched more than 650 contactless public transit projects worldwide, processing more than one billion tap-to-pay transit rides in 2022.Methodology: Visa Global Urban Mobility Survey 2023 The Visa Global Urban Mobility Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research in May 2023 among 11,500 respondents in 12 markets who take public transportation: Singapore, Japan, Egypt, Australia, United States, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and Chile.

Verizon deployed a COLT (Cell on Light Truck) in Lahaina on August 12 to replace coverage for the infrastructure damaged in the fires. In addition, the fiber optic cable that transports voice and data traffic from cell sites to the rest of the network was damaged by the fire. To replace the fiber transport, Verizon is utilizing a fleet of STEERs (Satellite Trailer Emitting Equipment Remote) to handle voice and data traffic moving to and from its existing sites outside of the fire zone in Western Maui. Restoring service to the existing cell sites with satellite backhaul re-enables full coverage, giving Verizon customers a better experience on the network.While Verizon works to fully restore the network, there may be inconsistent and partial restoration of network coverage. Verizon recommends using text and call and to avoid data-heavy applications.For previous network updates, please see the August 14 news release.Community assistance:Verizon is providing free wireless device charging at the following American Red Cross shelters to assist shelter clients with their charging needs:Mayor Hannibal Tavares Community Center, 91 Pukalani St, Makawao, HI 96768War Memorial Stadium, 700 Halia Nakoa St, Wailuku, HI 96793South Maui Community Park Gymnasium, 1501 Liloa Dr. Kihei, Maui, HI 96753King's Cathedral Maui 777 Maui Veterans Hwy, Kahului, HI 96732How you can help: Text WILDFIRES to 52000 to make a one-time $10 donation to The Salvation ArmyText HAWAII to 90999 to make a one-time $10 donation to the American Red CrossSupporting our First Responders: The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team continues to provide mission-critical communications support to public safety agencies conducting emergency response operations in Maui at no cost to the supported agencies.The team remains on site supporting federal, state and local emergency management teams and is coordinating communication needs and efforts with multiple public safety agencies operating in the region.

""Gold Rush"": Focus on 3 Stocks Selling the ""Picks""The AI Arms RaceOpenAI and Microsoft’s AI “Chatbot” ChatGPT shocked the world in late 2022 with its capability, speed, and user growth. Less than a week after launching, ChatGPT reached a billion users, reaching the milestone well before previous consumer application record holders like Instagram (took more than two months) and Netflix (took 3.5 years). A few months after ChatGPT went mainstream, Googlelaunched its Chatbot named Bard.Competition Heating upLike the internet boom of the late 1990s, innovators nationwide are beginning to understand how transformative and potentially profitable the technology can be. Today, we know that Google beat out Yahoo! and others in the search engine wars. However, before these juggernauts became dominant in their respective spaces, it was unclear who would win out of the thousands of competitors who ultimately made it. While ChatGPT is the early leader, the race has just begun. Despite the tough competition, the rewards are perceived to be enough such that innovators worldwide are racing for AI supremacy.Why Search for “Gold” When you can Sell the “Picks”?Investors looking to cash in on the AI revolution have two choices: bet on a company they think can win the AI race, or bet on the companies that are necessary to run AI. In my mind, the odds favor the latter. Below are 3 such companies that are buyable now:Semiconductors Will Power AIZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the obvious choice. Nvidia is the market leader in high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, computing, and accelerated computing.4 Billion Reasons to BuyLast quarter, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by upping quarterly revenue guidance to $11 billion after announcing revenue of $7 billion. Wall Street is catching up – for the current year, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest NVDA will grow eps at a cool 133.23%Story continuesGlobal AdoptionWhat analysts may not foresee is the global adoption taking place. China’s internet giants want to buy $5 billion worth of high-performance Nvidia chips used in generative AI. The buying mania comes as tensions between the US and China hit a fever pitch.Quantum Computing Will Lead to Cost SavingsIonq is the only pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock. The company’s website says, “The dawn of the quantum age is here. IonQ is developing quantum computers designed to solve the world’s most complex problems and transform business, societies, and the planet for the better.”AI Isn’t CheapDid you know it costs about $100 thousand daily to run ChatGPT? Meanwhile, Google’s Bard Chatbot costs about ten times more than a standard Google keyword search. As AI grows in popularity, these costs will only increase. Quantum computing companies like IonQ are a potential solution. IonQ can help companies like Google run the large language models (LLMs) necessary for generative AI at a fraction of the cost.Investors are noticing the potential. Year-to-date, IonQ shares are up 348%.

233,fa50b8a9-1bd9-3c6d-ab86-4ac727e98f6f,NVDA,2023-08-16,Nvidia price target raised by analysts ahead of earnings,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-finance-tech-editor-dan-211904796.html,1692134344,VIDEO,['NVDA'],"[Analysts are raising their price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) ahead of the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings report next week. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley explains that the target increases are significant, noting Nvidia is “really going to have to knock it out of the park if they’re going to beat this.” Howley highlights the risk of a potential Nvidia earnings shortfall, given its prominent position as a frontrunner in the current surge of AI-driven stock gains within the tech sector. Nvidia now faces pressure to live up to expectations in order to avoid derailing what Howley calls the “AI hype train.”Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Our expectations are high for NVIDIA ahead of its second quarter earnings results next week. Now, these earnings report-- this earnings report is going to be the AI hype cycle's biggest test yet potentially. Here for a deeper dive, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Is it going to live up to those expectations?DAN HOWLEY: That's what analysts seem to think. We have a bunch of different analysts from different Wall Street firms raising their price targets. We have Wells Fargo going from $450 to $500. We have Baird going from $475 to $570, UBS from $475 to $540. These are big changes. And this comes even after Nvidia had signaled that they were going to outperform for this current quarter revenue.We're looking at a-- let's see here-- on the earnings per share, a 306% year-over-year increase. On actual revenue, a 64% jump year-over-year. You remember that the prior anticipated revenue was for $7.2 billion for the quarter. But NVIDIA came out and said, look, we're going to bring in $11 billion plus or minus 2% for the quarter. So they're really going to have to knock it out of the park if they're going to beat this. But it seems like everybody is just saying, sure, it's a shoo in at this point.That's where the potential negative comes in, because, you know, this is one of the companies that's been driving the AI hype cycle, alongside Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon. If they miss, and I'm not saying they're going to, I'm just saying if, then it could give the whole AI hype train could kind of derail it for the time being, just for a little bit. The problem that NVIDIA has, if they have any problems at this point, is they can't get as many products out as they want. TSMC just doesn't have capacity at this point.Story continuesWhen these companies put in orders, the NVIDIA customers put in orders, it takes some time for those to get out the door. And right now, because so many people are going to NVIDIA, because so many people want to get into AI, they can't match up with what they're offering. So some analysts say, look, they'll eventually catch up in, you know, 2024, something along those lines. It's not that big of a deal.But it is something that I think is worth looking at, especially when you say, OK, everybody wants to see the, I guess, results of the big hype cycle, start showing it to me. Microsoft tried to do that a little bit in its most recent earnings, pointing to specific numbers when it comes to AI. Google was like, hey, here's some products that we have out now that are doing it. And Meta's like, we're working on it.So every company is putting it out there. Apple's just like, it's there, just don't worry about it. But, you know, when it comes to NVIDIA specifically, they have to show how it's benefiting them. And hopefully, for them, they're able to do that. If not, then, like I said, it could derail the hype cycle for a little bit.AKIKO FUJITA: Derail the hype cycle. I mean, Dan, this is a stock that is up more than 200% off of that hype cycle.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, this is an absolute runaway. And, you know, for NVIDIA, we've kind of talked about this before, it's-- they hit the kind of big to do in tech at just the right time. They did it with crypto, bottom fell out of that and happened to fall out of that as well. With NVIDIA, where they had inventory problems, they did it with gaming. That's really how they made their bones. They made enough money to go ahead and invest in the AI efforts. And then for years, they've been doing this AI thing. People kind of dismissed it at first. And now, it's just paying off big time. We'll just see if they can actually meet this.I think people are expecting them to blow away the 11 million number. And then what does that mean for the next quarter? Are they going to expect more from that? And then what does that mean for the next year comp, right, because then, that's going to be, OK, well, you went from here to here, what are you going to do next year? Are you going to fallSEANA SMITH: Got to see it slow down at some point.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: We'll see. The pressure is on.DAN HOWLEY: Yes, yes.SEANA SMITH: It's safe to say for NVIDIA to deliver on those expectations. All right. Dan Howley, thanks.DAN HOWLEY: Thank you.]"

The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted for over a year, with longer-term bonds yielding less than short-term debt instruments. This persistent situation pressures profits that banks can earn on loans.""We would probably end up with an inverted yield curve for longer than anticipated, even if we don't end up with an economic recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.""That would end up curtailing lending because even if you were my brother-in-law, I wouldn't want to lend to you at a loss.""The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.16% to end the session at 4,437.86 points.The S&amp;P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since March.The Nasdaq declined 1.14% to 13,631.05 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.02% to 34,946.39 points.Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.1 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.9 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.Story continuesA report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks.

The expanded partnership is anticipated to cover additional liquid renewable fuels, including renewable gasoline blends, biodiesel and renewable diesel. The MoU is aimed at encouraging commercial and industrial adoption in North America.According to Jennifer Rumsey, president and CEO of Cummins, the agreements with Chevron are a cornerstone of the former’s ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Ron DeSantis’ takeover of a board that oversees Walt Disney World, the Republican governor's appointees said in a Tuesday court filing.Members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District asked the state judge in Orlando for a summary judgment that would rule in their favor on five of the nine counts in their case.The case is one of two lawsuits stemming from the takeover, which was retaliation for Disney’s public opposition to the “Don’t Say Gay” legislation championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. In the other lawsuit, in federal court in Tallahassee, Disney says DeSantis violated the company’s free speech rights.DeSantis isn't a party in the state court case in which his appointees accuse Disney of wrongly stripping them of powers over design and construction at Disney World when the company made agreements with Disney-friendly predecessors. The DeSantis appointees argued that the board of Disney supporters didn't give proper notice, lacked authority and unlawfully delegated government authority to a private entity.The judge in the state case last month refused Disney's request to dismiss the lawsuit.The fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors' authority was limited by the company's agreements with predecessors.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.The governor has touted his yearlong feud with Disney in his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, often accusing the entertainment giant of being too “woke.” Disney has accused the governor of violating its First Amendment rights.Story continuesIn an interview with CNBC on Monday, DeSantis urged Disney to drop the company's lawsuit, saying that he and his allies have moved on from the feud with the company.“They’re suing the state of Florida. They’re going to lose that lawsuit,” DeSantis said on CNBC’s “Last Call.”___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Broadcast and cable each hit a new low of 20% and 29.6% of total TV usage, respectively, to combine for a linear television total of 49.6%.Time spent streaming (via a television) increased 2.9% in July compared with June, according to the data, to reach a record of 38.7% of total TV usage. YouTube (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) all saw month-over-month viewership increases of 5.6%, 4.2%, and 5%, respectively, in July.""Linear TV [is] past the point of no return,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients on Monday, adding the revenue line for cable and satellite operators is ""probably permanently negative"" as pricing fails to drive upside while TV advertising growth stalls.""We think the metrics for linear TV are all bad,"" the analyst continued. ""Ad revenue across our media network coverage fell 13% on average in Q2, down from -8% in 1Q, which included the Super Bowl. We forecast the second half of the year will get slightly better, but to remain negative including an off-political year comparison.""The data comes as more consumers drop their cable packages in a trend known as cord-cutting and instead opt for streaming services that are traditionally less profitable for media companies.Still, streaming is not exactly outperforming either, Nollen warned, explaining subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined.""Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time,"" he wrote, adding the growth was aided by Netflix's password-sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.Story continuesComcast's Peacock (CMCSA) was able to grow its subscriber base 84% year-over-year to 24 million, up from the prior 13 million, as the streamer works to catch up to its peers amid a significant lag.""June 26 was the last day for Xfinity subscribers to get Peacock for free,"" Nollen noted, citing that deadline as a likely catalyst for the subscriber additions. ""This pricing trend follows Disney's collective price hikes, with Hulu soon to be the most expensive ad free platform at $17.99. As land grabs for subscribers have slowed, companies have turned to pricing increases to fuel revenue growth.""Another area that's fueling revenue growth? Direct-to-consumer advertising, which grew 27% on average across media companies including Disney (DIS), Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA). That's double from the 13% growth posted in the first quarter.Nollen said Comcast is the farthest behind, as only 14% of its estimated revenues are expected to come from DTC in 2024 with the other 85% stemming from its linear networks.

(AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Such a change from Fitch would put the industry's rating below some of the country's largest banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America, CNBC reported. Thus the credit ratings for those giant banks would need to be cut, which could trigger sweeping downward adjustments for many of their smaller rivals.The end result is that investors will demand more return to own bonds of banks with lower ratings, thereby increasing costs for banks and putting more pressure on profits.""We expect sponsorship from debt investors to be there, albeit at a bigger price,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Manan Gosalia said in a research note last week. ""The risk is that this downgrade wave is persistent and continues beyond"" the third quarter, Gosalia added.Most bank stocks fell Tuesday. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) fell 2.8% while the KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX) fell 3.4%.Among the country's biggest banks Bank of America (BAC) fell the most, off 3.2%. M&amp;T Bank (MTB) was down 4.2%. Western Alliance (WAL) and Comerica (CMA) fell 4% and 4.5%, respectively.New demands from regulatorsThe focus on the costs of selling bonds coincides with a campaign by regulators to pressure banks to issue more long-term debt as a way of stabilizing institutions during times of stress.Story continuesThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are preparing a proposal that would require banks with at least $100 billion in assets to issue enough long-term debt to absorb losses if regulators were forced to seize the institution. The FDIC, Fed, and OCC have already proposed that banks of this size hold more capital as a way of absorbing losses.The long-term debt requirement would make it easier for banks to hold onto depositors during periods of panic, according to FDIC chair Martin Gruenberg.Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman Martin Gruenberg. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""Such a long-term debt requirement bolsters financial stability in several ways,"" Gruenberg said in a speech Monday. ""It absorbs losses before the depositor class — the FDIC and uninsured depositors — take losses. This lowers the incentive for uninsured depositors to run.""He said ""we expect the proposal to provide for a reasonable timeline to meet the debt requirement and to take into account existing debt outstanding."" The decision to apply it to banks with as little as $100 billion in assets was ""an outcome certainly influenced by the events of earlier this year.""This spring the failures of three sizable banks that were all within the range of $100-250 billion triggered outflows across the banking system and panic that other banks could also fall. Many mid-size banks were able to lure depositors back in the second quarter by paying more for them. That increase, however, is eating into a key measure of profitability.One bank trade group, the Bank Policy Institute, said the speech from Gruenberg didn’t include any discussion of the costs of imposing this new requirement at a time when ""these banks are already facing significant deposit funding cost increases.""""With this proposal, the government will be forcing a large supply of bank debt into the market, but it’s unclear whether there is going to be sufficient demand for it, meaning this proposal could end up doing more harm than good,"" said Tabitha Edgens, a BPI senior vice president and senior associate general counsel.Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari.

The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 22.5% to the $103.11 per share closing price of Akamai's common stock on August 15, 2023.Story continuesAkamai estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $1,084.5 million (or approximately $1,247.4 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by Akamai.Subject to costs and expenses related to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and share repurchases described below, Akamai intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering to repay at maturity a portion of its $1,150 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 0.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, which mature on May 1, 2025, and/or to pay cash amounts due upon any earlier conversion thereof.Akamai intends to use approximately $127.3 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Akamai from the sale of warrants pursuant to the warrant transactions described below). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Akamai expects to sell additional warrants to an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers and other financial institutions (the ""Option Counterparties"") and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes, together with the proceeds from the additional warrant transactions, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions with the Option Counterparties.Akamai also intends to use approximately $75.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of the notes in the offering in privately-negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates. The purchase price per share in such transactions will equal $103.11, the closing price per share of Akamai's common stock on August 15, 2023.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Akamai entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the same number of shares of Akamai's common stock that will initially underlie the notes, including any notes purchased by the initial purchasers pursuant to their option to purchase additional notes. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution with respect to Akamai's common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or to offset any cash payments Akamai is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. The warrants will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the same number of shares of Akamai's common stock. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect with respect to Akamai's common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Akamai's common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless Akamai elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in cash.In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Akamai's common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Akamai's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Akamai's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Akamai's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Akamai's common stock or other securities of Akamai in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes or following any repurchase of the notes by Akamai on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Akamai's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of holders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders receive upon conversion of the notes.This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act and shall not constitute an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of Akamai's common stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes). Any offer of notes was and will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.The release contains information about future expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to Akamai's expectations to complete the offering of the notes, its use of proceeds from the offering and the effect of the concurrent stock repurchase and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. There can be no assurance that Akamai will be able to complete the notes offering on the anticipated terms, or at all. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including, but not limited to, the terms of the notes and the offering, risks and uncertainties related to whether or not Akamai will consummate the offering, the impact of general economic, industry, market or political conditions and other factors that are discussed in Akamai's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents periodically filed with the SEC.In addition, the statements in this press release represent Akamai's expectations and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Akamai anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause these expectations and beliefs to change. However, while Akamai may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Akamai's expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.Contacts:Gina SoriceMedia Relations646-320-4107gsorice@akamai.com Tom BarthInvestor Relations617-274-7130tbarth@akamai.comCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akamai-announces-pricing-of-upsized-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes-301901787.htmlSOURCE Akamai Technologies, Inc.]"

The Saudis have pledged to keep up with such cuts through September.Along with the broader crude stockpile gain it reported for last week, the API cited a slide of 1.0M barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that takes delivery of U.S. crude. In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of 0.112M barrels.Distillates stocks down too, but those of gasoline jumpOn the fuels side, API reported a gasoline gain of 0.7M barrels and a distillate stock slide of 0.8M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 0.413M barrel draw for gasoline and 2.093M deficit for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that have been rallying the past six weeks.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.050 million barrels, versus the 5.851M barrel rise reported during the week to Aug 4.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 1.6M barrels on top of the 2.661M-barrel decline in the previous week.

Bank loans slid to a 14-year low last month; consumer and producer prices declined and exports slid their most since February 2020. The stumbling Chinese economy and lack of any effective stimulus measures have pressured the yuan against the dollar, which has rallied since the start of this week, adding to the weight of commodities, particularly oil.“Crude prices continue to pull back after disappointing Chinese industrial production data,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, who also cited a German survey that showed heightened concerns about growth in Europe’s leading economy.“The oil market might remain tight, but most of the headlines are turning bearish for the demand side,” added Moya. “Oil’s pullback might need to continue a while longer before buyers emerge.”In Tuesday’s trade, New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled down $1.52, or 1.8%, at $80.99 a barrel, clinging to the $80 per barrel support. In the prior session, WTI lost 0.8%, bringing its week-to-date drop to 2.6%.That was a breakaway from a previous seven-week rally inspired by optimism over Saudi production cuts that left the U.S. crude benchmark up 20% in all, with a 9-month high at $84.89.London-based Brent crude settled down $1.32, or 1.5%, at $84.89, adding to Monday’s 0.7% decline. Week-to-date, Brent was down 2.2% after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return and a seven-month high of $88.10.Story continuesMarket participants were also on the lookout Tuesday for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from the API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Aug 11. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.050 million barrels, versus the 5.851M barrel rise reported during the week to Aug 4.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 1.6M barrels on top of the 2.661M-barrel decline in the previous week.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider. The S&amp;P 500 entered the bull market territory earlier this year. It has gained 17% year-to-date from its lowest point in October 2022. The rebound in stocks has increased investors' confidence in the stock market's future outlook as they are also investing more actively.This year's investment trend has pushed tech stocks into the spotlight because of the increasing fascination with artificial intelligence (AI). The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has returned 5.34% since the start of the year, underperforming the broader market by a wide margin.That said, dividend stocks are regaining attention once more. Refinitiv Lipper reported that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which follows companies increasing dividends for over 25 years, saw a strong increase of $33 million in investments over a two-week period ending on July 19. This was its biggest gain in two weeks since January.Morgan Stanley has also given a positive outlook on dividend stocks as these equities could enhance overall gains and reduce volatility in a portfolio. The firm's report highlighted that there is a possibility of lower equity returns and market uncertainty in the coming years, which could make dividends a bigger part of the overall stock market gains. Between 2013 and 2022, around 17% of the S&amp;P 500 Index's total returns were from dividends. However, over a long period of time, starting from the 1930s, dividends represented 37% of the market’s overall returns.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsDividend stocks remain on investors’ radars because even if these stocks don't do as well for a while, there's nothing like steady dividend payments, especially during turbulent times.

We forecast the second half of the year will get slightly better, but to remain negative including an off-political year comparison.""The data comes as more consumers drop their cable packages in a trend known as cord-cutting and instead opt for streaming services that are traditionally less profitable for media companies.Still, streaming is not exactly outperforming either, Nollen warned, explaining subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined.""Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time,"" he wrote, adding the growth was aided by Netflix's password-sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.Story continuesComcast's Peacock (CMCSA) was able to grow its subscriber base 84% year-over-year to 24 million, up from the prior 13 million, as the streamer works to catch up to its peers amid a significant lag.""June 26 was the last day for Xfinity subscribers to get Peacock for free,"" Nollen noted, citing that deadline as a likely catalyst for the subscriber additions. ""This pricing trend follows Disney's collective price hikes, with Hulu soon to be the most expensive ad free platform at $17.99. As land grabs for subscribers have slowed, companies have turned to pricing increases to fuel revenue growth.""Another area that's fueling revenue growth? Direct-to-consumer advertising, which grew 27% on average across media companies including Disney (DIS), Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA). That's double from the 13% growth posted in the first quarter.Nollen said Comcast is the farthest behind, as only 14% of its estimated revenues are expected to come from DTC in 2024 with the other 85% stemming from its linear networks. Disney is the farthest along, with DTC revenue expected to surpass linear network revenue for the first time in 2024.Disney CEO Bob Iger.

(NYSE:PRU) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-checks-buying-prudential-financial-100309162.html,1692180189,STORY,['PRU'],"[Readers hoping to buy Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Prudential Financial investors that purchase the stock on or after the 21st of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Prudential Financial has a trailing yield of 5.4% on the current share price of $93.29. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Its dividend payout ratio is 90% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Prudential Financial's earnings per share have dropped 21% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Prudential Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Prudential Financial is already paying out 90% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.The Bottom LineIs Prudential Financial worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been declining and the company is paying out more than half its profits to shareholders; not an enticing combination. This is not an overtly appealing combination of characteristics, and we're just not that interested in this company's dividend.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Prudential Financial don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Prudential Financial that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

""Gold Rush"": Focus on 3 Stocks Selling the ""Picks""The AI Arms RaceOpenAI and Microsoft’s AI “Chatbot” ChatGPT shocked the world in late 2022 with its capability, speed, and user growth. Less than a week after launching, ChatGPT reached a billion users, reaching the milestone well before previous consumer application record holders like Instagram (took more than two months) and Netflix (took 3.5 years). A few months after ChatGPT went mainstream, Googlelaunched its Chatbot named Bard.Competition Heating upLike the internet boom of the late 1990s, innovators nationwide are beginning to understand how transformative and potentially profitable the technology can be. Today, we know that Google beat out Yahoo! and others in the search engine wars. However, before these juggernauts became dominant in their respective spaces, it was unclear who would win out of the thousands of competitors who ultimately made it. While ChatGPT is the early leader, the race has just begun. Despite the tough competition, the rewards are perceived to be enough such that innovators worldwide are racing for AI supremacy.Why Search for “Gold” When you can Sell the “Picks”?Investors looking to cash in on the AI revolution have two choices: bet on a company they think can win the AI race, or bet on the companies that are necessary to run AI. In my mind, the odds favor the latter. Below are 3 such companies that are buyable now:Semiconductors Will Power AIZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the obvious choice. Nvidia is the market leader in high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, computing, and accelerated computing.4 Billion Reasons to BuyLast quarter, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by upping quarterly revenue guidance to $11 billion after announcing revenue of $7 billion. Wall Street is catching up – for the current year, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest NVDA will grow eps at a cool 133.23%Story continuesGlobal AdoptionWhat analysts may not foresee is the global adoption taking place. China’s internet giants want to buy $5 billion worth of high-performance Nvidia chips used in generative AI. The buying mania comes as tensions between the US and China hit a fever pitch.Quantum Computing Will Lead to Cost SavingsIonq is the only pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock. The company’s website says, “The dawn of the quantum age is here. IonQ is developing quantum computers designed to solve the world’s most complex problems and transform business, societies, and the planet for the better.”AI Isn’t CheapDid you know it costs about $100 thousand daily to run ChatGPT? Meanwhile, Google’s Bard Chatbot costs about ten times more than a standard Google keyword search. As AI grows in popularity, these costs will only increase. Quantum computing companies like IonQ are a potential solution. IonQ can help companies like Google run the large language models (LLMs) necessary for generative AI at a fraction of the cost.Investors are noticing the potential. Year-to-date, IonQ shares are up 348%. However, in the past few weeks, the stock has finally retreated to the 50-day moving average, offering investors another chance to get on board.IonQ is just getting started. Like anything in economics, supply and demand forces are critical for determining future prices. Because IonQ has a tiny share float (# of shares available for trading by the public) of ~159 million shares, continued positive news may send shares even higher.AI Will Drive Cloud &amp; Database GrowthZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Stock Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Benefitting from the AI RevolutionOracle is likely to continue to grow rapidly due to the AI revolution. The company offers AI-driven solutions and tools to help businesses integrate machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into their applications and processes – something almost every big tech company is rushing to do.13F Shows Smart Money is Entering the StockLegendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller has famously never had a down year in more than 30 years of investing. Druckenmiller’s 13F disclosure shows that ORCL is a new buy for him. Steady MoverDespite Oracle’s massive size, it is talked about less than stocks such as Microsoft and Amazon.Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are an investor's dream.Technical BreakoutOracle is breaking out of a classic bull wedge today. Furthermore, while the Nasdaq is deep in the red, ORCL is green and is exhibiting relative strength – a bullish sign.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.16%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.02%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.14%.Heading into today, shares of the software maker had lost 2.79% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.82% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.27% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Oracle is projected to report earnings of $1.14 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 10.68%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.45 billion, up 8.82% from the year-ago period.ORCL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.51 per share and revenue of $53.85 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.62% and +7.8%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Oracle is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Digging into valuation, Oracle currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.96. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 28.85, which means Oracle is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that ORCL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.62. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.41 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Less than a week after launching, ChatGPT reached a billion users, reaching the milestone well before previous consumer application record holders like Meta Platform’s (META) Instagram(took more than two months) and Netflix (NFLX) (took 3.5 years). A few months after ChatGPT went mainstream, Alphabet (GOOGL) launched its Chatbot named Bard.Competition is Heating up Like the internet boom of the late 1990s, innovators nationwide are beginning to understand how transformative and potentially profitable the technology can be. Today, we know that Google beat out Yahoo! and others in the search engine wars. At the same time Amazon (AMZN) took the cake for e-commerce with its laser focus on customer satisfaction and speed rather than early profitability. However, before these juggernauts became dominant in their respective spaces, it was unclear who would win out of the thousands of competitors who ultimately made it. While ChatGPT is the early leader, the race has just begun. Despite the tough competition, the rewards are perceived to be enough such that innovators worldwide are racing for AI supremacy.Why Search for “Gold” When you can Sell the “Picks”?Investors looking to cash in on the AI revolution have two choices: bet on a company they think can win the AI race, or bet on the companies that are necessary to run AI. In my mind, the odds favor the latter.Below are 3 such companies that are buyable now:Semiconductors Will Power AIZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia (NVDA) is the obvious choice. Nvidia is the market leader in high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, computing, and accelerated computing.4 Billion Reasons to BuyLast quarter, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by upping quarterly revenue guidance to $11 billion after announcing revenue of $7 billion. Wall Street is catching up – for the current year, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest NVDA will grow eps at a cool 133.23%Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGlobal AdoptionWhat analysts may not foresee is the global adoption taking place. China’s internet giants want to buy $5 billion worth of high-performance Nvidia chips used in generative AI. The buying mania comes as tensions between the US and China hit a fever pitch.Quantum Computing Will Lead to Cost SavingsIonq (IONQ) is the only pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock. The company’s website says, “The dawn of the quantum age is here. IonQ is developing quantum computers designed to solve the world’s most complex problems and transform business, societies, and the planet for the better.”AI Isn’t CheapDid you know its costs about $100 thousand daily to run ChatGPT? Meanwhile, Google’s Bard Chatbot costs about ten times more than a standard Google keyword search. As AI grows in popularity, these costs will only increase. Quantum computing companies like IonQ are a potential solution. IonQ can help companies like Google run the large language models (LLMs) necessary for generative AI at a fraction of the cost.Investors are noticing the potential. Year-to-date, IonQ shares are up 348%. However, in the past few weeks, the stock has finally retreated to the 50-day moving average, offering investors another chance to get on board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewIonQ is just getting started. Like anything in economics, supply and demand forces are critical for determining future prices. Because IonQ has a tiny share float (# of shares available for trading by the public) of ~159 million shares, continued positive news may send shares even higher.AI Will Drive Cloud &amp; Database GrowthZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Stock Oracle (ORCL) is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Benefitting from the AI RevolutionOracle is likely to continue to grow rapidly due to the AI revolution. The company offers AI-driven solutions and tools to help businesses integrate machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into their applications and processes – something almost every big tech company is rushing to do.13F Shows Smart Money is Entering the StockLegendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller has famously never had a down year in more than 30 years of investing. Druckenmiller’s 13F disclosure shows that ORCL is a new buy for him.  Steady Mover Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is talked about less than stocks such as Microsoft and Amazon.Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are an investors dream.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical BreakoutOracle is breaking out of a classic bull wedge today. Furthermore, while the Nasdaq is deep in the red, ORCL is green and is exhibiting relative strength – a bullish sign.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 3.06, the question arises: Is Oracle's stock modestly overvalued? This article aims to provide a comprehensive valuation analysis to answer this question. Read on to discover more about Oracle's financial health and the intrinsic value of its stock.About Oracle CorpWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ORCL. Click here to check it out. ORCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ORCLFounded in 1977, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) has pioneered the first commercial SQL-based relational database management system. The company provides database technology and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to enterprises worldwide. Today, Oracle boasts 430,000 customers in 175 countries, backed by its 136,000 employees. With its stock currently priced at $117.78 per share, we compare this with the GF Value, an estimation of the fair value, to provide an in-depth analysis of the company's value.Oracle's Stock: A Modestly Overvalued Asset?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates that the stock is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, it suggests that the stock is undervalued and its future return is likely to be higher.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) appears to be modestly overvalued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. With its current price of $117.78 per share, Oracle stock appears to be modestly overvalued.Story continuesConsidering Oracle's relative overvaluation, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Oracle's Stock: A Modestly Overvalued Asset?For potentially higher future returns at reduced risk, consider these high-quality companies.Oracle's Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid this, it is crucial to research and review a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Oracle has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11, ranking worse than 92.06% of companies in the Software industry. The overall financial strength of Oracle is 4 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is poor.Oracle's Stock: A Modestly Overvalued Asset?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Oracle has been profitable 10 years over the past decade. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $50 billion and an EPS of $3.06. Its operating margin is 27.37%, which ranks better than 94.25% of companies in the Software industry. Overall, the profitability of Oracle is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. Oracle's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 65.53% of companies in the Software industry. However, Oracle's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 9.4%, which ranks worse than 50.28% of companies in the Software industry, indicating poor growth.Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. In the past 12 months, Oracle's ROIC was 9.88 while its WACC came in at 9.75.Oracle's Stock: A Modestly Overvalued Asset?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) appears to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 50.28% of companies in the Software industry.

Moreover, as transaction volume increase, MA’s top line is likely to increase in the future.

A booming digital economy further provides an impetus to the tech giant to upgrade cross-border payments across different parts of the globe. MA’s intensified focus on strengthening its foothold in Africa is also clearly reflected in its latest move.Mobile Internet connections are expected to grow rapidly in Africa due to low-cost smartphones. This growth in Internet connections is spurring demand for digital content, social media, e-commerce and online education. Hence, it is vital to make online payments easy and secure for both banked and unbanked consumers.MasterCard is collaborating with governments, central banks, financial institutions, mobile network operators, large retailers and other stakeholders across Africa to understand the economic outlooks of its countries, their unique demographics, infrastructure challenges and hidden opportunities.Other Business Service PlayersSome other stocks in the Business Services space are Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma highlights how fast-food brands, such as McDonald's (MCD), Yum! Brand's KFC (YUM), and Chipotle (CMG), are redesigning their restaurant locations to cater to the uptick in pick-up orders ticking upward since the pandemic.Video Transcript- Wendy's is revamping its kitchens, making it the latest hamburger chain to start redesigning its restaurants. Now many chains have taken to modifying their in-store experiences with the intention of maximizing digital sales and making the to-go experience much easier. Let's bring Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma back in to give us those details. Hey, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Rachelle. That's right, Wendy's telling Yahoo Finance exclusively the launch of its next gen kitchen design. Now this is ultimately in a attempt to increase kitchen capacity as well as fuel growth here, particularly when it comes to digital sales, which is a major business for Wendy's. So the next gen kitchen design is for restaurants with the highest customer demand. It's intended to deliver a nearly 50% increase in kitchen capacity compared to that of its next gen design, something they announced in late 2022.It includes a dual side layout that includes its intention to include an increased speed of service as well as volume of service. Now on top of that, that next gen design that the company introduced last fall in late 2022 is now open in both Kansas and Oklahoma. Abigail Pringle, Wendy's chief development officer, telling us that they know that digital is a part of the future. And they've seen a growth pre-pandemic.But that really pushed way through the pandemic when it comes to digital and mobile orders. And in addition to that, they have to then, you know, change the way their restaurants look to then meet that digital need of fuel, you know, growth driver really for Wendy's as well as other fast food companies. In addition to that, they do plan to have elements of this next gen restaurant design to be included in more than 200 stores. Or rather, this included in more than 7,000 of their stores. And they plan to open a next gen restaurant design. So this very future focused format in more than 200 stores throughout 2024. And so your local Wendy's may be looking a little different in the coming year.Story continues- And as we seem to just want our fast food even faster, Wendy's not the only company doubling down on technology and restaurant renovations to drive sales. What else are you seeing?BROOKE DIPALMA: Consumers are taking more meals on the go. Pre-COVID, they saw about 70% of consumers, you know, taking meals on the go. Some opting to dine in. But now 85% to 90% are taking meals on the go. And so what we're seeing here is these fast food giants really adapt to that change. Last summer, we saw KFC introduce their next gen design. That included mobile order pickup, consumer pickup in store.We also saw a mobile order pickup outside for companies to really double down on that third party delivery when it comes to Uber Eats as well as Grubhub, among others. We also saw Chipotle introducing a new kitchen design in an attempt to help with labor time so that ultimately employees can come in at a later time and cook their chicken and steak faster. We saw those cook times drop dramatically when it comes to this updated kitchen design that ultimately, in an effort to get customers in and out and ultimately fill those mobile orders faster.In addition to that, we saw McDonald's introduce in Fort Worth, Texas, a completely digital on-the-go. It has essentially no seating. Attempted to, you know, win over those consumers who are on the go. And in addition to that, we're really just seeing a slew of other names-- Dutch Bros, Potbelly, as well as really, you know, once again Chipotle, Yum Brands, and McDonald's doubling down on this digital first approach to really boost and meet those increase in mobile orders here.- Certainly one of those post-COVID things that's just here to stay. We got comfortable not spending so much time in these restaurants, and now this is the result. Fantastic stuff. A big thank you there to our very own Brooke DiPalma.]"

EHTH revised its guidance for major metrics upward during the second quarter results announcement, which indicates improving operations. It expects total revenues for 2023 to be within $439-$459 million, up from the year-ago level of $405.4 million. Higher revenues from Individual, Family and Small Business, and Medicare businesses are likely to boost the top line in 2023.The rising top line, coupled with lower costs, thanks to its transformation initiatives, is expected to reduce losses in 2023. It expects GAAP net loss for the year to be within $26-$46 million, narrowing from the previously guided range of $35-$55 million. Further, EHTH anticipates its adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be within a loss of $3 million and a profit of $17 million, which also shows improvement from the previous guidance.Now, if we look at its surprise history, eHealth beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters and missed twice, with an average surprise of 33.4%.It reaffirmed its 2023 operating cash outflow guidance range of $30-$15 million. To understand how its business performance is improving and whether it can reach the guidelines, let’s take a look at its results from the last reported quarter.Q2 EarningseHealth reported a second-quarter 2023 adjusted loss of $1.05 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.5%. The bottom line, however, narrowed from the prior-year quarter’s loss of $1.15 per share.Lower Medicare Advantage members, ancillary product members and individual and family plan approved members affected its second-quarter earnings. The negatives were partially offset by increased lifetime value (“LTV”), commissions and its transformation initiatives. Lower operating costs further benefited the bottom line.The top line increased 32% year over year to $66.8 million. The figure beat the consensus mark by 33.9%.Operational UpdateeHealth reported commissions of $60.2 million for the quarter, up 26% year over year. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.1%. Other revenues jumped 156% from the prior-year period to $6.6 million, beating the consensus mark by 163.3%.Story continuesThe total operating costs and expenses declined 3% year over year to $92.9 million in the second quarter. Lower marketing and advertising, technology and content expenses and cost of revenues were partially offset by higher customer care and enrollment, and general and administrative costs.Net loss improved 37% year over year to $23.5 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $14.8 million in the quarter under review, showing an improvement of 55% from a year ago.Segmental UpdateMedicare: Revenues from the segment jumped 35% year over year to $55.4 million, beating the consensus mark by 41.7%. Segmental loss narrowed 81% year over year to $4.7 million due to its transformation initiatives. The segment was supported by increased commissions, partially offset by lower Medicare Advantage plan approved members.Individual, Family and Small Business: Revenues from the segment climbed 21% year over year to $11.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.5%. Segmental profit surged 54% year over year to $6.7 million. The segment benefited from higher LTV, partially offset by decreased ancillary product approved members and individual and family plan approved members.Financial Update (as of Jun 30, 2023)eHealth exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $153.2 million, which rose from the 2022-end level of $144.4 million. Total assets of $1,053.4 million decreased from the figure of $1,112.6 million at 2022 end.Long-term debt was $66.9 million at the second-quarter end, marginally up from $66.1 million at 2022-end.Total shareholders’ equity of $600.9 million decreased from the 2022-end level of $651 million.Operating cash outflow in the second quarter of 2023 was recorded at $9.4 million, down from $25.8 million in the year-ago period. This shows growing strength in operations.How Did EHTH’s Industry Peers Fare in Q2?eHealth belongs to the Zacks Insurance Brokerage industry, which also includes bigger market players like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, Aon plc AON and Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG.Marsh &amp; McLennan reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.20, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% thanks to a strong performance of the Risk and Insurance Services segment, led by the Marsh business' robust international operations. A well-performing Consulting unit also contributed to the upside. However, an elevated expense level partially offset the results.Aon reported second-quarter 2023 operating earnings of $2.76 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82 due to increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partly offset by strong retention, business generation, growth in core P&amp;C, and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Asia and Pacific region operations.Arthur J. Gallagher reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted net earnings of $1.90 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1% thanks to higher adjusted revenues and margin expansion across the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, partially offset by higher expenses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma highlights how fast-food brands, such as McDonald's (MCD), Yum! Brand's KFC (YUM), and Chipotle (CMG), are redesigning their restaurant locations to cater to the uptick in pick-up orders ticking upward since the pandemic.Video Transcript- Wendy's is revamping its kitchens, making it the latest hamburger chain to start redesigning its restaurants. Now many chains have taken to modifying their in-store experiences with the intention of maximizing digital sales and making the to-go experience much easier. Let's bring Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma back in to give us those details. Hey, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Rachelle. That's right, Wendy's telling Yahoo Finance exclusively the launch of its next gen kitchen design. Now this is ultimately in a attempt to increase kitchen capacity as well as fuel growth here, particularly when it comes to digital sales, which is a major business for Wendy's. So the next gen kitchen design is for restaurants with the highest customer demand. It's intended to deliver a nearly 50% increase in kitchen capacity compared to that of its next gen design, something they announced in late 2022.It includes a dual side layout that includes its intention to include an increased speed of service as well as volume of service. Now on top of that, that next gen design that the company introduced last fall in late 2022 is now open in both Kansas and Oklahoma. Abigail Pringle, Wendy's chief development officer, telling us that they know that digital is a part of the future. And they've seen a growth pre-pandemic.But that really pushed way through the pandemic when it comes to digital and mobile orders. And in addition to that, they have to then, you know, change the way their restaurants look to then meet that digital need of fuel, you know, growth driver really for Wendy's as well as other fast food companies. In addition to that, they do plan to have elements of this next gen restaurant design to be included in more than 200 stores. Or rather, this included in more than 7,000 of their stores. And they plan to open a next gen restaurant design. So this very future focused format in more than 200 stores throughout 2024. And so your local Wendy's may be looking a little different in the coming year.Story continues- And as we seem to just want our fast food even faster, Wendy's not the only company doubling down on technology and restaurant renovations to drive sales.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-mcd-expensive-130022932.html,1692104422,STORY,['MCD'],"[Key InsightsMcDonald's' estimated fair value is US$223 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$289 suggests McDonald's is potentially 30% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 32% lower than McDonald's' analyst price target of US$327Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for McDonald's Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.90bUS$9.35bUS$9.26bUS$10.00bUS$10.3bUS$10.6bUS$10.9bUS$11.1bUS$11.4bUS$11.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.30% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$8.2kUS$8.0kUS$7.3kUS$7.4kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$68bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.2%) = US$204bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$204b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$94bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$162b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$289, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.169. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McDonald'sStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

BJRI, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO, Chuy's Holdings, Inc. CHUY, McDonald's Corp. MCD and Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. PLAY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Solid Restaurant Stocks to Buy on Soaring SalesSales at U.S. bars and restaurants have been growing steadily since the beginning of the year. The industry suffered a lot during the peak of the pandemic, with sales nosediving. The struggle continued till last year before making a solid turnaround.The trend has since continued and even rising costs and inflationary pressures haven't impacted sales much. In fact, higher demand has been driving sales almost every month. Given this situation, stocks like BJ's Restaurants, Inc., Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc., Chuy's Holdings, Inc., McDonald's Corp. and Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales JumpSales as U.S. bars and restaurants totaled $88.9 billion in June, matching the adjusted sales figures of the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, restaurant sales increased a solid 8.4% in June.The retail sector has been struggling for months as inflationary pressures continue to hamper sales. Despite that, sales have continued to grow and the restaurant industry has been largely responsible for boosting sales. Although higher prices have made consumers spend cautiously over the past year, they have been shelling out lavishly at restaurants, which bodes well for the industry.In the retail sector, the Zacks Defined Restaurant Industry is presently ranked in the upper 15% among all industries, boasting a year-to-date return of 8.9%.Story continuesIndustry Poised to GrowMultiple factors are driving sales in the restaurant industry. This can be attributed to core aspects such as changes in operational procedures, workforce, layout designs and technological advancements.Restaurant owners are also focusing on digital advancements, strategies to boost sales and cost-saving endeavors. The increasing impact of the Internet has made digital innovation crucial. Prominent restaurant chains are consistently collaborating with delivery services and digital platforms to generate additional sales.Besides, inflation has also declined over the past 12 months. Although the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased a modest 0.2% in July, inflation has sharply declined from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.Cooling inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its interest rate hike campaign. This is likely to further help the restaurant industry, as lower interest rates will allow people to spend more.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these five restaurant stocks.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. owns and operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Seagate Technology Holdings’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings What's The Opportunity In Seagate Technology Holdings?According to my valuation model, Seagate Technology Holdings seems to be fairly priced at around 13.78% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Seagate Technology Holdings today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $59.60, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Seagate Technology Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Seagate Technology Holdings look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Seagate Technology Holdings' revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in STX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on STX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.15. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.70. PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.16, all within the past year.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.98. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 4.51. Over the past year, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.26, with a median of 2.75.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.38. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.24.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.01. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 19.08. Within the past 12 months, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 9.98.If you're looking for another solid Automotive - Domestic value stock, take a look at Polaris (PII). PII is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Polaris sports a P/B ratio of 5.64 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 4.51. In the past 52 weeks, PII's P/B has been as high as 6.79, as low as 5.06, with a median of 5.78.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that PACCAR and Polaris are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR and PII sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PCAR has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.06, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 69.08. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.01. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.16.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.98. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 14.66.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.PCAR stands above TSLA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This agreement marks a significant milestone for UPS and its employees, solidifying its position as a leading logistics provider. Let's delve into the details of this agreement and its implications for UPS, its customers, and the Teamsters.Understanding the UPS and Teamsters AgreementUPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSThe agreement between UPS and the Teamsters is being hailed as a win-win-win. It addresses the concerns and priorities of the Teamsters' leadership, UPS employees, and the company itself. The contract ensures that UPS continues to reward its employees with competitive pay and benefits, solidifying its position as an industry leader in this regard.Key Changes in the New ContractThe new contract brings several positive changes for UPS employees. One significant change is the conversion of all 22.4 employees, who are weekend delivery drivers, to regular full-time packaged car drivers. This provides UPS with the flexibility to schedule delivery drivers from Tuesday through Saturday, while also offering improved work-life balance for the drivers.Working conditions for all UPS employees will also see improvements, including the introduction of air conditioning in every new U.S. packaged car starting in January 2024. The contract also allows UPS to introduce new technology and utilize seasonal support during peak holiday seasons.Furthermore, the contract strengthens the industry-leading pay and benefits that Teamster employees already enjoy. By the end of the contract, the average UPS full-time driver will make approximately $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. Part-time union employees will also see an increase in their minimum hourly wage to $25.75, along with full healthcare and pension benefits.Story continuesImplications for UPS ShareholdersTome delved into the second-quarter results, acknowledging that the negotiations with the Teamsters had a significant impact on volume diversion. Consolidated revenue for the quarter declined by 10.9% to $22.1 billion due to lower volume. However, UPS managed to deliver $2.9 billion of operating profit, in line with expectations. The consolidated operating margin exceeded expectations at 13.2%.Tome also discussed UPS's progress in becoming the number one complex healthcare logistics provider globally. The company opened its first dedicated healthcare distribution facility in Ireland, expanding its European footprint. Revenue from the healthcare portfolio reached $4.7 billion in the first six months of 2023, with an expected full-year revenue of $10 billion.UPS's International Expansion and Technological InnovationsOn the international front, UPS has been rapidly expanding in India, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The company launched MOVIN, an asset-light domestic joint venture, and expanded its coverage to 49 of the largest cities in India, representing approximately 90% of the B2B market opportunity.Tome concluded her remarks by emphasizing UPS's Innovation Driven approach. The company leverages technology, such as the Network Planning Tools (NPT), which use AI and machine learning to quickly make changes to planning, scheduling, and volume flows across the network. NPT enabled UPS to match capacity with volume levels, resulting in a nearly 10% reduction in hours in the U.S. while maintaining industry-leading service. UPS is also making progress in rolling out its RFID initiative, Smart Package Smart Facility, with almost 50% of U.S. buildings operating with this technology by the end of the second quarter.FedEx's Position Amid UPS's NegotiationsFedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) has been benefiting from the recent Teamster negotiations with UPS. According to Brie Carere, an executive at FedEx, the company has not seen any material benefit from the UPS labor negotiations in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, she mentioned that these negotiations have opened up a lot of doors for FedEx and they are having great conversations with legacy UPS customers. This indicates that FedEx is capitalizing on the opportunity to attract customers who may be looking for alternatives due to the UPS negotiations.Over 500 UPS executives had regular contact with customers to prevent volume diversion or win back diverted volume after the settlement. Tome emphasized the company's commitment to executing win-back initiatives and leveraging investments in the digital customer experience to tap into the $7 billion sales pipeline opportunity.FedEx's Competitive Advantage and Market OpportunitiesCarere also expressed confidence in FedEx's strong value proposition compared to its primary competitor, UPS. This suggests that FedEx is positioning itself as a favorable option for customers who may be seeking reliable and efficient shipping services. The company's sales pipeline is expected to benefit from these conversations and the perceived advantages over UPS.Furthermore, Carere mentioned that FedEx has seen a shift in customer trades within its portfolio, particularly in the Asia region. With the reopening of the IE (International Economy) product in the fourth quarter, FedEx has experienced positive performance and is pleased with the sales pipeline in the Asia-Pacific team. This indicates that FedEx is successfully attracting customers who may have previously relied on UPS for their shipping needs.Overall, while FedEx did not see immediate material benefits from the UPS labor negotiations, the company is optimistic about the long-term opportunities that have arisen as a result. By leveraging its strong value proposition and engaging in conversations with legacy UPS customers, FedEx is well-positioned to benefit from the changing dynamics in the shipping industry.Analysts' Perspective on UPS's SituationWhile Tome was exceptionally skillful in delivering an upbeat message the analysts in the room didnt buy it. The response has been overwhelmingly negative. All analysts reporting to Zacks.com downgraded the stock for this quarter, this year, and next year. After all, $170,000 pay and benefits package has me re-thinking what I do for a living. Lots of pay equals lots of cost and when FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) is not yet ruled by the Teamsters it seems like FedEx can use this as an opportunity to gain market share though lower cost services.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation third-quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results conference call. Today's call will be conducted by the company's Chief Executive Officer, Dave Rosa, and the Chief Financial Officer, Ron McClurg.Before I turn the call over to Mr. Rosa, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of US federal security laws with respect to future operations, financial results, events, trends, and performance, which are based on management's beliefs and assumptions of today's call or other specified date. Forward-looking statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our implied or implied by such statements. See NeuroOne's corporate update press release and SEC filings for information regarding specific risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update such forward-looking statements.With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Dave Rosa, CEO of NeuroOne. Please go ahead, sir.Dave RosaThanks, operator. During our fiscal third quarter and through today, the company continued to make significant progress across a number of commercial, development, and financing objectives. Let's first cover progress with the company's Evo sEEG electrode limited launch.I'm pleased that we have completed the number of cases we were targeting for a limited launch and have begun training the remaining Zimmer Biomet field sales personnel in an effort to expand the launch. Those efforts began in August. All the centers that participated in the limited launch, with the exception of one, placed the Evo sEEG electrode with Zimmer Biomet's ROSA One Brain, a robotic platform that assists surgeons in planning and performing complex, yet minimally invasive, neurosurgical procedures. We solicited feedback on the performance of the system from physicians and staff during and after these cases, and we're pleased with the feedback received. We have also received our first order for calendar year 2024 product supply from Zimmer Biomet.With regards to our OneRF ablation system, we submitted a 510(k) application to FDA on June 8. The FDA recently responded to the application with questions regarding some of the labeling, as well as requests for additional information on some of the testing we performed. We expect to discuss the request with the FDA at the end of this week in an effort to address them efficiently. At this time, we remain confident in our projections on commercialization of the system in the first half of 2024.Last quarter that we mentioned that we held discussions with two strategic organizations regarding their interest in licensing the technology, and we expect to continue those conversations during our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, we are also evaluating commercializing the device directly. In our next fiscal quarter, we expect to place initial orders for the system components in order to prepare for future commercialization.The company also continued to make progress in the development of our spinal cord stimulation program to treat chronic back pain. We successfully completed a 28-day animal implant utilizing a novel flexible thin film material without experiencing any adverse events or neurological complications. We also filed a non-provisional patent for a novel conformable thin film paddle that could be placed percutaneously on the spinal cord. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we have scheduled a study for the percutaneous placement of the paddle design in a spinal cord cadaver model by members of our advisory board.During our last quarterly call, I also discussed the potential for our electro technology to offer the ability to deliver genes or drugs to the brain, as well as record the agent's impact to the patient. As planned, we successfully completed feasibility testing in a small animal model at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. We've received enthusiastic feedback from neurologists and neurosurgeons on the clinical applications, as well as potential for use in pharmacologic trials. We are currently in discussions with a biotech company regarding their interest in using our device in research studies and product development efforts, and expect to expand our efforts to discuss the technology with other potential partners.On the financial side, the company made progress with respect to revenue gains and improving our cash position. Moving forward, we also expect to see a reduction in operating cash burn from the current fiscal year as the cost for the development of our OneRF ablation system decrease. In addition, we increased product revenue based on our sales to Zimmer Biomet for the Evo product lines, and we improved our balance sheet through the use of an ATM facility and the recent capital raise, which Ron will take you through.Thank you for your time and attention. I would now like to turn it over to Ron for a more in-depth review of our fiscal second quarter financial results. Ron?Story continuesOperatorMr. McClurg, this is the conference operator. Is your line unmuted?Ron McClurgI apologize. I was muted. Thank you, Dave. Product revenue was $630,000 in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, compared to product revenue of $32,000 in the fiscal third quarter of 2022. For the first nine months of fiscal '23, product revenue was $1.2 million, compared to $102,000 for the same period in fiscal '22.Collaboration revenue was $1.46 million in the first nine months of fiscal '23, compared to collaboration revenue of $6,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Collaboration revenue was derived from the Zimmer Development Agreement and represents the portion of the exclusivity and milestone fee payments that are eligible for revenue recognition during the respective periods.Total operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter of '23 were $3.8 million, compared with $2.8 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Research and development expenses in the fiscal third quarter of '23 were $1.9 million, compared to $1.2 million in the same period of fiscal '22.

The company had working capital of $3.1 million as of June 30, 2023, compared to working capital of $9.1 million as of September 30, 2022.On July 27, 2023, the company consummated an underwritten public offering of its common stock from which the company received $5.2 million in net proceeds. In addition, since January of 2023, the company sold common stock under the ATM program from which the company received net proceeds of $2.5 million. Companies had no debt outstanding as of June 30, 2023.With that, I will turn it back to Dave.Dave RosaThanks, Ron. Operator, at this time, I think we can open for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Alex Nowak, Craig-Hallum.Hey, good afternoon, everyone. This is Connor on for Alex. Hey, my first one here is, can you speak to the training that Zimmer has done in the field for the depth electrode alongside the ROSA robot? And feeding off that, how many centers will they be rolled out by year end?Dave RosaYeah, so the training that's been done to date, we've trained over half their sales force on our device. Obviously, they were already trained on the ROSA robot. The question of how many centers by the end of the year, we can't put a hard answer to that. I think the longest part of the process in getting these centers up and running is getting the committees to approve the use of the device in the hospital. So, it really is going to depend on that.But Zimmer is actually going through a very targeted launch. The initial cases that we did in the limited launch were done at five sites. And then once we felt we hit the minimum number of cases for that part of the process, we then this month started to open it up beyond that. So, it's really going to depend on how quickly they're able to get the other centers through the product approval committees.Got it. Awesome. Okay. How is Zimmer thinking about adding the ablation electrode to their portfolio? Is that something that makes sense from your end or are there other partners that might make more sense?Dave RosaThe RF ablation project that we have was not included as part of the contract discussions with Zimmer or the agreement that we signed. In terms of does it make sense, this device would really be used after the procedure that Zimmer is currently selling into. So, there's a lot of synergy between the two systems.And we've said before that we've had discussions with Zimmer about this. And even in our press release, we talked about two strategics that we've had discussions with. So, you could probably figure out who one of them is regarding that. So, we'll continue those discussions.And if it makes sense from a financial standpoint as well as a strategic standpoint, then we would move forward. But I think Zimmer is very interested in that technology because it really does, it's really a follow-up to the procedure that they're already selling in.Perfect. And looking at next year with the launch of Evo, how much revenue could this business start to generate? And then adding on top the ablation, what can we expect to see from that or how can we think about that?Dave RosaYeah, we haven't pre-announced on what we expect for the Evo sales for 2024. As I mentioned, we did get an order from Zimmer for calendar year 2024 already. We still haven't finished off the orders that we have for 2023. But I think from both of our perspectives, Zimmer wants to see how many sites they'll have signed up by the end of the year before we really get a good feel for what those numbers would look like. And so, probably around the November time frame, we'll reevaluate where things are and that should give us a better idea as to what to expect next year.In terms of ablation, we haven't given any guidance on that either. And I think the first step, obviously, is to get the device cleared through FDA. And we're obviously probably going to be dealing with a launch time that starts somewhere during the course somewhere during the course of next year as opposed to January 1. So we'll obviously have to come back and determine what impact that could have.Got it. And then just feeding back to that FDA submission, you mentioned that there were questions on labeling and request for additional information there. Can you just expand on that at all? Or is that something you can dive into?Dave RosaYeah, I can't go into specifics. We're still in the middle of discussing this with FDA. But I can tell you that we were pleased with what we got back from FDA. We feel that what they've sent us is addressable. In fact, we had fewer questions than we had in the submissions on the other two devices, the Evo Cortical and Evo sEEG by itself. And the good news is we didn't have any other discussions on or questions on biocompatibility, which came up really in our last discussions with FDA on sEEG. So we feel good about the request that the FDA has come back with. And as I mentioned, we'll be having conversations with them at the end of this week to get more clarity.Awesome. Well, that's all I have, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, and good luck on the Evo launch.Dave RosaThank you.Operator(Operator Instructions) It appears that we have no further of the questions at this time. I'll now turn the program over for any additional or closing remarks.Dave RosaThanks, operator. Everyone, I just want to thank you for joining us on the call. Apologies for a little technical issue there, but appreciate the time that you spent listening to the progress that we've made. Have a good rest of the day, and we'll definitely be updating the market on how things go with discussions on FDA as well as the launch of the Evo sEEG electrode. Have a good evening.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

The company’s expanding wind and solar generation portfolio act as a tailwind.However, the company has to face certain headwinds, such as delay in the closure of PNM Resources’ deal and constraints related to new projects.TailwindsAVANGRID consistently spends capital to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure and facilities. It invested a total of $2.7 billion in 2022, with nearly 71% in its Networks segment and the rest in its Renewables segment. AGR plans to invest $3 billion in 2023 to strengthen its operations. It invested nearly $1.3 billion in the first half of 2023.The company is consistently expanding its clean energy generation capacity by adding more wind and solar sources to its portfolio. In April 2023, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. The agreement aims at exploring opportunities to develop up to 1 Gigawatt of green energy projects within the Navajo Nation in the states of New Mexico and Arizona.In March 2023, AVANGRID announced that it is set to utilize $30 million worth of high-quality solar trackers from the New Mexico based company, Array Technologies (ATI), to develop a 321-Megawatt (MW) solar farm in Texas. The company has increased the presence of sustainable energy in Texas, where it currently produces more than 1,250 MWs through six wind farms and has a pipeline of 1,300 MWs projects.HeadwindsThe delay in the proposed merger of PNM Resources with AVANGRID may adversely affect the latter’s benefits. It can result in additional pre-tax transaction costs and a loss in revenues associated with the uncertainty about the merger.AGR keeps investing in development opportunities but timely completion of the same and that too within budget might not be possible, which might adversely impact its financial condition and prospects.Story continuesTransition in Energy SpaceThe U.S. electric power sector is gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Most of the companies target replacing fossil fuels with renewables and believe in the development of new technologies such as energy storage and hydrogen. They have pledged to deliver 100% clean energy and achieve the zero-emission target in the coming years.To reap the benefits of the expanding renewable energy market, certain companies from the industry such as Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, PPL Corp. PPL and Ameren Corp. AEE are also transitioning faster toward clean energy.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, which excludes $2-$4 billion of potential incremental investment opportunities planned in the same time frame. The company is reducing coal consumption and targets to lower emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.XEL’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.34%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings indicates an increase of 5.4% from the 2022 reported figure.PPL expects a regulated capital investment plan of $12 billion during 2023-2026 and plans nearly $2.5 billion in capital investments for 2023. The company aims to achieve its carbon emissions target of 70% by 2035 and of 80% by 2040, from its 2010 level. It will do so through the introduction of new carbon capture technology and addition of more renewable sources to its generation portfolio.PPL also targets to become carbon neutral by 2050. Its long-term earnings growth rate is 7.42%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS indicates a year-over-year improvement of 12.8%.Ameren expects to spend up to $20.5 billion in the 2023-2027 period.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, ResMed's ROIC was 17.78, while its WACC came in at 8.23.Is ResMed (RMD) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisConclusionOverall, ResMed (NYSE:RMD) stock is believed to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong.

309,225eae2c-7645-3b66-b2dd-781df858e4a7,BSX,2023-08-16,Boston Scientific's (BSX) POLARx System Gets FDA Approval,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientifics-bsx-polarx-system-133800984.html,1692106680,STORY,"['BSX', 'PXXXF', 'JNJ', 'MDT', 'ABT']","[Boston Scientific Corporation BSX recently announced receiving FDA approval for its POLARx Cryoablation System. The POLARx FIT Cryoablation Balloon Catheter is a component of the new system intended to treat people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This catheter has the unusual ability to accommodate two balloon diameters, 28 and 31mm.The latest approval is likely to bolster Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular segment.More on POLARx Cryoablation SystemIn February 2020, the POLARx Cryoablation System gained the CE Mark, and in October 2021, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) granted its certification. In 2023, the POLARx FIT catheter was given the go-ahead in Europe, Japan, Canada, and several Asia Pacific markets.The latest system overcomes recognized drawbacks by rethinking current cryoablation options, enabling doctors to expand and modify the new POLARx catheter to match a patient's unique anatomy during an ablation treatment, which can reduce the need for time-consuming and disruptive device replacements. Additionally, the tool enables medical professionals to treat a more extensive variety of pulmonary vein anatomy and to design lesions in ideal locations to more effectively deliver therapy to the parts of the heart from which the disruptive impulses that cause AF originate.Data from the global, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm FROZEN-AF IDE clinical trial, which was presented at Heart Rhythm 2023, showed that the POLARx Cryoablation System was safe and efficacious for the treatment of 385 patients with paroxysmal AF.Significance of POLARx Cryoablation SystemThe expandable cryoballoon catheter in particular, part of the new POLARx Cryoablation System, is an exciting advancement for the successful treatment of AF since it enables medical professionals to better customise care for individual patients without compromising safety or effectiveness. As observed in the clinical evaluation, the system's maneuverability, combined with the ability to use different balloon sizes, allows it to address long-standing issues with various cardiac anatomy.Story continuesThe FDA clearance of the POLARx Cryoablation System, which has been used for more than 25,000 patients globally, heralds a significant development in managing atrial fibrillation (AF) and the dawn of a new era in cryoablation technology. This product transforms a crucial therapy in the electrophysiology field, attends to the unmet needs of physicians, and reaffirms the company’s commitment to bringing significant advancements to existing technologies by prioritizing procedural flexibility and individualized care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was valued at $22.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% by 2023. The increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and growing awareness about the condition are expected to drive the market.Peers Developments within Cardiac SegmentWithin cardiac ablation treatment, companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Abbott Laboratories ABT and Medtronic plc MDT are also making significant progress.In August 2023, Biosense Webster, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment and part of Johnson &amp; Johnson received the FDA approval for multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. The products that can be used in this workflow include: THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF catheter — the most commonly used ablation catheter in the world for RF ablation, THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter, CARTO VIZIGO Bi-Directional Guiding Sheath, PENTARAY NAV ECO High Density Mapping Catheter, DECANAV Mapping Catheters, and Webster CS Catheter.In July 2023, Abbott received the FDA approval for the AVEIR dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker system, the world's first dual chamber leadless pacing system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms. With more than 80% of people needing a pacemaker requiring pacing in two chambers of the heart (both the right atrium and right ventricle), the approval significantly increases access to leadless pacing for millions across the United States.In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for its Micra AV2 and Micra VR2, the next generation of its industry-leading miniaturized, leadless pacemakers. Micra AV2 and Micra VR2, the world's smallest pacemakers, provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers, while still delivering the many benefits of leadless pacing such as reduced complications compared with traditional pacemakers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.95 a share, just nine days from its upcoming earnings release on August 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $5.95 Most Accurate Estimate and the $5.86 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ulta Beauty has an Earnings ESP of 1.53%.ULTA is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Builders FirstSource is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 14, 2023. BLDR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.14 a share 91 days from its next earnings release.Builders FirstSource's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 7.58% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ULTA and BLDR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It is worth considering Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.This beauty products retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.14%.For the last reported quarter, Ulta came out with earnings of $6.88 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 per share, representing a surprise of 0.88%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.69 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.68 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.40%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Ulta. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ulta has an Earnings ESP of +1.53% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 24, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The award has been offered by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.Valued at $15.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2023.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its E-6B is a dual-mission aircraft capable of fulfilling either the no-fail TACAMO mission or the airborne strategic command post mission. The aircraft is equipped with an airborne launch control system, which is capable of launching U.S. land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 5.5% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 0.9% improvement from that reported in 2022.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%.

And, of course, there are some obvious stocks that will benefit from the broadband plan. “It’s the biggest investment in high-speed internet ever. Because for today’s economy to work for everyone, internet access is just as important as electricity, or water, or other basic services,” Biden said in a White House address in late June. Today, I want to get creative with some not-so-obvious stocks to benefit from Biden’s broadband plan. They won’t necessarily be internet providers or cable companies, but rather some infrastructure stocks that help the internet work properly ranging from data centers to fiber optic cable manufacturers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs a result, the names I suggest here might be something other than household names. However, I can assure you of two things: they will benefit from Biden’s push and they will already be profitable businesses. VeriSign (VRSN)Warren Buffet Stocks: a picture of warren buffett smiling.Source: Kent Sievers / Shutterstock.comDid you know Warren Buffett owns a big chunk of the domain registry provider VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN)? Because he does through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), which owns 12.4% of the internet registry business. However, because Berkshire has so much tied up in one stock — Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounts for 45.2% of the holding company’s $364 billion equity portfolio — the $2.6 billion Verisign holding represents just 0.7%.Why does Buffett like VeriSign? It made $364.4 million in the first six months of 2023 from $736.4 million in revenue. That’s nearly a 50% net margin, generating tremendous free cash from a slow-growth business. The company reported Q2 2023 earnings at the end of July. Thanks to growth at its domain-name registry business, the top line grew by 5.7% to $372 million, while it earned $1.79 in the second quarter, 25 cents higher than a year earlier. Story continues“Earlier this month we passed 26 years of 100 percent availability for the .com/.net domain name resolution system,” said Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. VeriSign noted that it had 174.4 million .com and .net domain name registrations at the end of June, 0.1% higher than a year earlier. To ensure that it continues to make money from this legacy business, it plans to increase the annual registry-level wholesale fee it charges for each new and renewal .net domain name registration by 99 cents to $10.91. That should go into effect on Feb. 1, 2024. Adding internet in all parts of rural America will have a knock-on effect on future revenue.Viavi Solutions (VIAV)Viavi building in Oregon Park. VIAV stock.Source: Adriana Iacob / ShutterstockI couldn’t remember why I knew the name Viavi Solutions (NASDAQ:VIAV), which provides testing solutions for fiber and other communications networks through their Network Enablement unit. And then it dawned on me that it was the old JDS Uniphase business. In Q3 2023, Viavi’s Network Enablement business accounted for $149.6 million of its $247.8 million in revenue. Its two other segments — Service Enablement (SE) and Optical Security and Performance Products (OSP) — accounted for the rest.Unfortunately, due to lower R&amp;D spending by potential customers in the first half of calendar 2023, revenues fell by 21.5% YOY, with a 12.9% decline from Q2 2023. That resulted in a 58.2% YOY decline in non-GAAP earnings to $28.3 million.CEO Oleg Khaykin stated: “On a positive side, we saw the beginning of stabilization of demand for our field instruments during the March quarter.  In the current quarter, we are seeing the signs of recovery in our Field Instruments and stabilization in the Lab &amp; Production business. We expect the stabilization and recovery momentum to continue into the second half of calendar 2023.”With VIAV stock down more than 26% over the past year, now would be a good time to look more closely at its shares. Four of the nine analysts covering its stock rate it a Buy, with five at Hold. Clearfield (CLFD)llustrative Editorial of Clearfield Inc website homepage. Clearfield Inc logo visible on display screen.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comClearfield (NASDAQ:CLFD) supplies the guts required for telecom, cable, and broadband providers to get fiber into homes and businesses across America. As I recently stated in a July article recommending the stock, “It calls itself ‘The Fiber to Anywhere Company.’ It has 44 patents on its various products.” I also highlighted that less than half of American households have access to fiber internet. The Biden administration’s plans ought to help that, and Clearfield will undoubtedly benefit from the extra internet spending. On Aug. 3, Clearfield reported its Q3 2023 results stating that revenues fell 10.0% to $61.3 million. As customers continue to work through inventory over the next few quarters, there will likely be a few more quarters with declining revenue YOY. In addition, its community broadband customers are waiting to see about internet funding before placing large orders. In the Q3 press release, CEO Cheri Beranek stated,“With government funding initiatives underway and significant rural broadband builds expected in the coming years, we anticipate strong demand for our core products once order patterns return to normalized levels.”Once these two issues pass, it should be clear sailing for the company and its sales. On the bottom line, Clearfield earned $10.4 million, 13% higher than a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose at a slower rate of 1.5% due to more shares outstanding. The company’s balance sheet is very sound. It has no long-term debt, with nearly $172 million in cash, short-term, and long-term investments. Most of the money ($130 million) is from issuing stock last December for general corporate purposes, which I think was a timely offer. The 1.38 million shares sold were at $100, about 60% higher than today’s value. As a result, the company has plenty of cash to deploy for rural broadband projects over the next 12-24 months. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Trane Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Trane Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Trane TechnologiesFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this manufacturer is expected to earn $8.77 per share, which is a change of 19.2% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Trane Technologies. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Trane Technologies to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

326,b87bf19d-0f16-371d-a897-b9a354acc59c,LYB,2023-08-16,Is There Now An Opportunity In LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-lyondellbasell-industries-n-110023937.html,1692183623,STORY,['LYB'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine LyondellBasell Industries’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries What's The Opportunity In LyondellBasell Industries?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that LyondellBasell Industries’s ratio of 14.83x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 15.07x, which means if you buy LyondellBasell Industries today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe LyondellBasell Industries should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because LyondellBasell Industries’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will LyondellBasell Industries generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 69% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for LyondellBasell Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in LYB’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at LYB? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on LYB, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for LYB, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of LyondellBasell Industries.If you are no longer interested in LyondellBasell Industries, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

ITT is benefiting from strength in the industrial, aerospace and defense end markets. Higher sales volume, pricing actions and robust order growth are also aiding the company. Increasing number of projects, and robust demand for parts and services in the aftermarket business are aiding the Industrial Process (IP) segment. Strengthening aero components and defense businesses are supporting the Connect &amp; Control Technologies (CCT) segment. Friction OE on time delivery and accretive pricing actions are driving growth for the Motion Technologies segment.The company’s focus on product innovation and business expansion through the addition of assets is advantageous. The acquisition of Micro-Mode Products, Inc. in May 2023 enhanced ITT's product portfolio and customer base, specifically for long-term defense programs. The addition of Micro-Mode grew ITT's existing North America connectors platform, which is a part of its CCT segment. ITT acquired Clippard Instrument Laboratories’ product lines in August 2022. With product lines of stainless steel, brass and aluminum cylinders, and volume tanks, the acquisition expands ITT’s Compact Automation product offering in the robotics, packaging and automation end markets.Among other companies from the Conglomerates sector, General Electric Company GE and Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL focus on strengthening and expanding its businesses through the acquisition of assets.General Electric acquired Nexus Controls in April 2023. This buyout allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for the further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform and is aiding the company’s Power segment.The acquisition is aligned with GE’s commitment to invest in leading controls technology and expertise to enhance customer experience.Over the past few years, Carlisle has become one of the major European manufacturers and suppliers of EPDM roofing systems, with acquisitions in Germany and the Netherlands. The company’s acquisition of MBTechnology, Inc. (February 2022) strengthened the Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) segment's building products platform, boosting its energy-efficient solution offerings.Also, in September 2021, Carlisle completed the acquisition of California-based Henry Company, which boosted the CCM segment's product offerings for repair and restoration works as well as construction activities.Coming back to ITT, the company’s measures to reward its shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts are encouraging. In 2022, the company bought back shares worth $245.3 million and paid out dividends of $87.9 million. In the first six months of 2023, dividend payment totaled $48.1 million and share repurchases were $60 million. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked 10% in February 2023.However, escalating costs and expenses have been a major concern for ITT over time. The company has been facing supply-chain constraints, particularly in the commercial aerospace end market. Also, the decline in the value of the local currencies of foreign markets relative to the U.S. dollar might affect the company’s top line in the quarters ahead.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.83 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.94 indicates a change of +12.5% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $91.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $367.83 billion and $391.64 billion estimates indicate +13.5% and +6.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.7%. EPS of $6.14 for the same period compares with $5.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +3.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These donations are part of UnitedHealthcare’s commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of the most underserved and, particularly, the population aging at home.Direct service workers (DSWs) are essential in providing care to the long-term services and supports recipients who choose to age and live in their homes, especially those in underserved communities and rural areas. DSWs include certified nursing assistants, home health aides, direct support professionals, personal care aides and other nonlicensed workers.""We know that investing in building a strong and sustainable direct service workforce is essential to better serve the Hoosiers who want to age in their homes and communities,"" said Chris Callahan, CEO, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Indiana. ""We are committed to making the health system work better for everyone by helping build a stable and well-trained workforce that delivers quality and compassionate person-centered care.""Donations have been provided to:Indiana Association for Home &amp; Hospice Care — $1,100,000 for an assistance program that provides benefits to DSWs such as funding for child care, car repairs, gas money, financial well-being and other needs that may hinder their ability to be fully involved in their professional lives.Ivy Tech Community College — $1,000,000 for a Direct Service Worker Pathway program that trains and prepares juniors and seniors in high school to enter the direct service workforce right away after high school while also developing stepwise career development opportunities.Mobile Integrated Health-Community Paramedicine — $250,000 to employ community paramedics in Montgomery County to improve home health for individuals age 60 and over through a program that will focus on four areas: improve care coordination on 911 calls related to falls; enhance referrals to community paramedics; increase completion of wellness visits and preventive care; and increase use of telehealth to assist with management of chronic conditions.Indiana University School of Medicine Geriatrics — $500,000 for a Project ECHO initiative and Learning Collaborative to share know-how among providers. Project ECHO — Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes — is a model that focuses on building provider capacity by connecting experts and specialists to local providers, fostering collaboration for increased knowledge. This model encourages a virtual, bidirectional exchange of information between peers and subject matter experts.Story continues""Indiana University Geriatrics is excited to deliver an educational series for providers across the continuum of care, so that they can better serve patients,"" said Dr. Cathy Schubert, director of Indiana University Geriatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine. ""We look forward to sharing knowledge that eventually maximizes benefit for all Hoosiers and their families.""""Indiana Association for Home and Hospice Care continues to seek new ways to support health care workforce needs through innovative programs,"" said Evan Reinhardt, executive director, Indiana Association for Home and Hospice Care. ""We are excited about this opportunity, which will allow DSWs to have a higher quality of life so they can better assist the increasing number of seniors who decide to age in their homes.""The direct service workforce is historically understaffed in Indiana and across the nation. The ongoing challenges of low wages and the intense demands of these occupations were brought to light more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the need for DSWs will only rise as Indiana’s aging population continues to grow and persons with disabilities live more independently, resulting in an increased demand for home- and community-based services.1About UnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare is dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone by simplifying the health care experience, meeting consumer health and wellness needs, and sustaining trusted relationships with care providers.

336,f0dcd875-329b-3195-8834-92fc4970ebf8,EL,2023-08-16,Coty (COTY) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coty-coty-reports-next-week-190253884.html,1692126173,STORY,"['COTY', 'EL']","[The market expects Coty (COTY) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 22, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +300%.Revenues are expected to be $1.32 billion, up 13.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coty?For Coty, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Coty will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coty would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.19, delivering a surprise of +533.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coty appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Cosmetics industry, Estee Lauder (EL), is soon expected to post loss of $0.04 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -109.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.49 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Estee Lauder has been revised 3.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -58.13%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Estee Lauder will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

337,e583609f-fbce-347a-8a78-8d469da58753,ADP,2023-08-16,7 Dividend Aristocrats That Have Raised Their Payouts for 25 Years or More,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-aristocrats-raised-payouts-210510319.html,1691615110,STORY,"['ITW', 'NEE', '^GSPC', 'ALB', 'CAH', 'ADP']","[In recent years, dividend aristocrats have become a popular choice among investors of all stripes. Dividend aristocrats, or S&amp;P 500 index components with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, have historically delivered total returns on par with the S&amp;P 500 but with lower volatility.If you want to invest in all the stocks in this category, it’s pretty easy. All you need to do is buy the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BATS:NOBL), which owns all 67 of these “aristocrats” in near-equal amounts.However, if you want to target even more substantial long-term total returns, selecting some of the highest-potential dividend aristocrat stocks may also be worth looking into.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor instance, the seven dividend aristocrats listed below offer a solid mix of growth, value, and yield, making them strong candidates for your portfolio, whether your investing strategy is focused more on income or capital growth.Automatic Data Processing (ADP)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockIf yield and growth are your investing objectives, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the top dividend stocks to buy. As you likely know, ADP is a leading payroll provider and related services to businesses.With this steady, recession-resistant underlying business, it is no surprise that ADP stock has historically produced strong total returns for investors. Although past performance does not indicate future returns, as I argued last spring, this stock has a solid chance to continue producing above-average total returns.Taking another look at the numbers, I reiterate this view. Sell-side forecasts call for earnings growth of around 10% in the coming years. Assuming shares keep climbing in tandem with earnings growth, coupled with the stock’s 2.03% forward dividend (which has grown by an average of 13.7% annually for the past five years), double-digit returns are likely within reach.Story continuesAlbemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comIf capital growth is your focus, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a dividend aristocrat to consider. Shares in this specialty chemicals company have one of the dividend aristocrats’ lowest forward yields (0.8%). Dividend growth over the past five years (averaging 3.95% annually) has also been modest.However, due to the stock’s strong growth catalyst, this relatively low yield is more than made up for. Albemarle has high exposure to the current “lithium boom,” fueled by the auto industry’s big pivot towards producing electric vehicles (or EVs). Admittedly, a strong pullback in lithium prices has recently lowered ALB stock.Yet based on the company’s latest quarterly results and guidance, it’s clear that demand and prices for lithium remain likely to keep rising. This points to more earnings growth, dividend growth, and higher prices ahead for ALB shares.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) may be a more appealing choice for value-conscious investors. Shares in the healthcare distributor trade at a forward price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio of around 16. This is slightly below the average P/E ratio (18.5) for the basket of dividend aristocrat names included in the NOBL portfolio.While cheaper than average, CAH stock has a forward dividend yield (2.19%). That’s only slightly above the average yield among the aristocrats (1.89%). Dividend growth has also been lackluster in the past five years, averaging just 1.3% annually.Still, with the prospect of double-digit earnings growth in the coming years (boosted by plans to repurchase up to $3.5 billion worth of shares), CAH (up by 51.5% over the past year) could keep rising due to increased earnings and perhaps, due a possible further expansion of its forward multiple.Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browserSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is another of the dividend aristocrats with many years of dividend and earnings growth under its belt that is likely to continue delivering a similar level of performance.The industrial conglomerate continues to increase its rate of payout steadily. Just last week, ITW raised its dividend by 7%. With this, ITW stock now has a forward annual dividend yield of 2.12%. While the current economic slowdown is expected to affect earnings this year, long-term earnings prospects for Illinois Tool Works remain promising.Analyst forecasts call for 6% earnings growth in 2024 and more than 7% in 2025. This level of growth, plus ITW’s high-quality reputation, is likely sufficient for shares to maintain their forward multiple of around 25.3. Between shares rising in tandem with this earnings growth, plus the steady, growing dividend, ITW could continue producing solid total returns.Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comNot only does Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) hold dividend aristocrat status. The home improvement retailer also holds dividend king status, with its more than 50-year track record of dividend growth.That’s not the only thing that makes this stock appealing. LOW stock trades for around 16.7 times forward earnings. Lowes’ main rival, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), trades at a much higher valuation (21.8 times earnings). This big gap exists, despite Lowe’s having a higher level of expected earnings growth.There may be doubts LOW can deliver such earnings growth, yet I believe it is attainable, primarily because of how aggressively the company is buying back shares. This will help to boost earnings per share. Delivering this level of growth may help bridge this valuation gap. Alongside returns stemming from LOW’s 1.97% dividend, this could mean strong returns ahead for investors buying the stock today.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comRising interest rates have knocked utilities stocks lower, and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is no exception. However, suppose you’ve been looking to make this one of the dividend aristocrats in your portfolio. In that case, NEE’s selloff works to your advantage, and not only because interest rates aren’t set to stay high forever.Due to NextEra’s higher exposure to the clean energy revolution than other utilities, NEE stock has long commanded a premium valuation. Yet with NEE’s pullback in price, you can buy it today for 22.2 times forward earnings. This may be a low valuation compared to the company’s growth potential.As InvestorPlace’s John Blakenhorn recently argued, NextEra’s efforts in renewable energy and battery storage will likely continue to drive earnings growth. This points to further growth of NEE’s dividend (forward yield today of 2.7%) and solid price appreciation over a long time frame.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockPaying out dividends monthly since its founding 54 years ago, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has been one of the most consistent dividend stocks. Real estate investment trusts (or REITs), like utilities, have also been hammered by rising interest rates, but again, this may make now a great time to initiate a position in this stock.Thus, buy O stock today and lock down a 5.18% dividend yield. While Realty Income has a long dividend track record, dividend growth hasn’t been exceptionally high (averaging around 3.73% annually) over the past five years.Even so, don’t assume disappointing returns lie ahead for O shares. Besides a 5.18% (and gradually growing) yield, there’s also a strong chance this REIT will experience a big rebound in price once interest rates normalize. Considering this, snapping up O today could prove to be a profitable move in hindsight.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceThe #1 AI Name for 2023 Could Be About to Ignite This $20.6 Trillion Wealth ShiftMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

But it’s even harder for the millions of children without basic oral care supplies. For them, a toothbrush and toothpaste are so much more than just basic necessities: They’re game-changers.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815857177/en/This back-to-school season, Crest and Oral-B are launching their latest #ClosingAmericasSmileGap campaign with a new creative OLV that positions these essential, but often forgotten school supplies as the game-changers they can be for kids in need. You can view the OLV here. In support of the campaign, Crest and Oral-B are partnering with actor, director and activist, Jesse Williams, as well as parent and teacher influencers across social media to showcase their morning and night-time routines to bring awareness to the fact that many kids lack the basic oral care supplies people use every day. Crest and Oral-B are also giving consumers an opportunity to help close the smile gap. For every Crest or Oral-B product purchased from August 1st to September 30th, the Brands will donate oral care supplies to a child in need.1""As a child growing up in disenfranchised communities and as a former teacher in a low-income school district, I’ve seen first-hand how a lack of resources can significantly impact kids’ confidence and academic performance, which can ultimately lead to missed opportunities,"" said Jesse Williams. ""The basic necessities we take for granted – like a toothbrush, toothpaste and routine dental checkups – can be game-changers for those without access. That’s why I’m proud to partner with Crest and Oral-B to help end oral health inequity and close America’s smile gap.""Story continuesThis campaign marks the next step in Crest and Oral-B’s #ClosingAmericasSmileGap initiative, which was launched in 2021 to address the painful reality that many kids in underserved communities don’t have access to the oral care they need. To underscore the critical need for oral healthcare among these communities, Crest and Oral-B have released a ""U.S. Kids’ Oral Health Report Card2"" that sheds light on the shocking discrepancies in access, affordability and education between low and high-income families in the U.S. Top findings include:Nearly 90% (7 in 8) US adults don’t know tooth decay is the number one chronic disease for children.Almost 50% of American children have at least one cavity by age 6.Nearly half (44%) of children in low-income households brush less than the recommended amount of twice per day, while 73% of high-income children brush twice or more a day.Parents in low-income households are less likely to prioritize oral health products in their household budget, ranking cell phone service above oral health products in a list of household necessities.High-income households are more likely to be able to take their kids to the dentist during school/working hours.One third (33%) of low-income parents say they can’t afford to take their children to the dentist.""The ‘U.S. Kids’ Oral Health Report Card’ illustrates the state of America’s Smile Gap for kids in underserved communities and motivates us to continue the important work we do at Crest and Oral-B to help close it,"" said Carlos Quintero, Vice President, Oral Care, North America at Procter &amp; Gamble. ""This year, we’re hosting multiple oral care access events in America’s hardest hit communities where we’ll provide free dental screenings, oral health education and thousands of oral care products to those in need. But we aren’t stopping there; we want to drive awareness of the Smile Gap to help motivate all Americans to join us in our efforts. That’s why we’re honored to partner with Jesse Williams for our 2023 Back-to-School campaign. Through this partnership, we’ll reach millions of Americans who can take action this back-to-school season and help get these game-changers in the hands of those who need them most, bringing us one step closer to our goal of closing America’s smile gap for all.""For more information on how to join forces with Crest and Oral-B in #ClosingAmericasSmileGap, please visit: https://crest.com/closing-americas-smile-gap/1 Crest &amp; Oral-B will donate up to 500,000 products purchased from August 1st to September 30th, 2023.

Horton (NYSE:DHI) shareholders have earned a 24% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-nyse-dhi-120052630.html,1692187252,STORY,['DHI'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 173% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 13% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 7.0% in 90 days).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, D.R. Horton managed to grow its earnings per share at 33% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 8.81.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how D.R. Horton has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling D.R. Horton stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of D.R. Horton, it has a TSR of 189% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that D.R. Horton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 63% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand D.R. Horton better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  D.R. Horton is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

According to its latest 13F filing, which came out yesterday, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway initiated positions in just three new stocks during the second quarter — NVR (NYSE:NVR), Lennar (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Interestingly, all three are homebuilders.While investors should always do their own due diligence before making any investment, taking inspiration from Buffett’s moves isn’t a bad idea, and luckily for investors who want to follow the Oracle of Omaha’s lead, there’s an ETF that owns large positions in all three of Berkshire Hathaway’s recently added positions — the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB).ITB is a $2.5 billion ETF from BlackRock’s iShares that gives investors, according to BlackRock, “exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture residential homes” by investing in “an index composed of U.S. equities in the home construction sector.” Let’s take a closer look at this home construction-focused ETF and why it’s an effective way to invest in Buffett’s new buys.Why Homebuilders?While the move has been a bit under the radar, homebuilders have actually posted a strong rally year-to-date — for example, ITB is up 44.4% year-to-date. We previously covered the move to the upside in homebuilder ETFs when the rally was starting to kick into full gear earlier this summer.While these stocks have rallied off of their previous lows, the fact that all three of Berkshire’s new buys are homebuilders seems to indicate that Buffett and his portfolio managers have conviction in the idea and see value in the space as a whole.Buffett is, first and foremost, a value investor, and despite the aforementioned rally, homebuilders (including the ones Buffett bought) still look like a bargain. For instance, D.R. Horton is valued at 13.2 times earnings, Lennar trades for 12.7 times earnings, and NVR has a price-to-earnings multiple of 13.7.Story continuesThese leading homebuilders all trade at sizable discounts to the broader market — the S&amp;P 500 currently has a price-to-earnings multiple of about 20. The ITB ETF itself is even cheaper than these individual stocks, with an average price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5.Furthermore, many analysts and observers believe that there is a long-term shortage of new housing in the United States, so these homebuilders could have the wind at their backs over the long term as supply catches up with demand.ITB’s HoldingsNot only does ITB own all three of Berkshire’s new buys, but they are also actually its three largest holdings, as you can see in the overview of ITB’s top 10 holdings below.D.R. Horton is the fund’s top holding, with a weighting of 14.8%. Lennar is ITB’s second-largest position, with a 12.1% weighting, while NVR is its third-largest holding, with a weighting of 7.3%. Clearly, ITB gives investors significant exposure to the newest additions to Buffett’s portfolio, as these three new buys make up over a third of ITB’s assets.Beyond these three Buffett buys, the fund also owns other prominent homebuilders, including its fourth-largest holding, Pultegroup, as well as Toll Brothers, Meritage Homes, and Taylor Morrison.Additionally, the fund owns other companies that either serve or supply the homebuilding industry, such as paint maker Sherwin-Williams, home improvement juggernaut Home Depot, and building materials suppliers like Builders Firstsource and TopBuild.ITB Vs. XHB ETF — Which Should You Choose to Follow Buffett?Many readers may be familiar with another popular homebuilder ETF, the SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB). So why should an investor looking to invest like Buffett choose ITB over XHB?The answer is that while XHB owns Lennar, D.R. Horton, and NVR, it doesn’t give investors nearly as much exposure to these three stocks as ITB does. In fact, as you can see in the table below, none of these three names occupy a place within XHB’s top 10 holdings.Within XHB, D.R. Horton has a weighting of just 3.7%, Lennar has a weighting of 3.7%, and NVR comes in at 3.6%.These are both good ETFs, and this isn’t to say that ITB is a better ETF than XHB, but for readers looking to invest like Buffett, ITB is clearly the better option as it has much larger positions in his three new holdings.Is ITB Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, ITB has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, as 56% of analyst ratings are Buys, 36.7% are Holds, and 7.3% are Sells. At $96.25, the average ITB stock price target implies 8.54% upside potential.Long-Term Performance Homebuilding is known to be a cyclical industry, but looking at it over the years to smooth out the ups and downs, on average, ITB has posted some pretty solid returns. As of the end of the most recent quarter, ITB’s three-year annualized total return stood at a very impressive 25.4%. Using this same time frame, over the past five years, the ETF’s five-year annualized return is 18.3%, and over the past 10 years, it generated a 14.9% annualized total return.These results mean that ITB has outperformed the broader market over the same time frame — as of the end of last quarter, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) had three-, five-, and 10-year annualized total returns of 14.6%, 12.3%, and 12.8%, respectively.Additional Considerations One minor downside of ITB that investors should take note of is that while it isn’t an overly-expensive ETF in terms of fees, it isn’t particularly cheap either, with an expense ratio of 0.40%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into ITB would pay $40 in fees in year one. Over the course of a decade, these fees add up, and the same investor would pay $505 in fees, assuming the expense ratio remains the same and that the fund returns 5% per annum.It should be said that the expense ratio isn’t out of line with its nearest competitor, XHB, which charges an expense ratio of 0.35%.On the plus side, ITB is a dividend payer, although its current yield is just 0.6%.Bottom LineThe 13F filings that investment firms file with the SEC give investors a window into the portfolios and the trades of top investors like Buffett. Investors should always do their own research before making an investment, but learning about and following the moves of all-time great investors is a great starting point when it comes to generating new investment ideas.It’s interesting that all three stocks that Buffett and his portfolio managers initiated positions in during the second quarter are the same types of businesses. Clearly, the team at Berkshire Hathaway likes what it sees in the homebuilder space, which features cheap valuations and potential long-term tailwinds. The ITB ETF gives investors the opportunity to gain significant exposure to this industry and all three of Buffett’s new stocks in one investment vehicle.Disclosure]"

The company also reaffirming its guidance that it set last quarter, expecting a drop in sales and adjusted earnings for the full year as consumers remain cautious. The reason, though, why we're not seeing red on the screen is even though we did get that drop in same-store sales, it wasn't as big of a decline, Akiko, as the Street had been bracing for.But you talk about the fact that consumers are under pressure. They're tightening their budgets. They're not as willing to spend on some of those larger ticket items. And a name like Home Depot it's going to suffer a bit from the shift that we're seeing in consumer spending.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, it's worth noting again when you look at Home Depot, Lowe's is right in that camp as well. I mean, they have just seen such an incredible run-up over the last three years that it's tough to match that when you consider what things are playing out right now. We did hear the retailer saying essentially they're not going to be raising prices anymore, but they are seeing the consumer turn a bit more cautious to your point, Seana, maybe delaying some of those big ticket items.The DIY projects aren't happening anymore. That's been the trend for some time now. When you think about the professional builders, they are still going to Home Depot as well. But some of those projects are being delayed out of concerns about rising rates. But also, when you think about the home market, the overall slowdown that we have seen there that's really hit Home Depot in a way as well. So we're seeing that reflected in the numbers we got today.Story continuesNow checking in on the home builder sector as rising mortgage rates are taking the steam out of the market, sentiment for newly built homes dropped six points to 50 in August, according to the National Association of Home Builders. That is the first decline in seven months and the lowest level we have seen since May, when sentiment first rose out of negative territory. When you think about what's happening in this space, it is very much sort of the similar storylines that we have been watching, Seana.It is about higher mortgage rates and seeing increasingly Sellers remain on the sidelines. You talk about buyers getting pushed higher in terms of prices because there's not enough inventory there as well, and that's leading to a broader slowdown even as we see new construction taking shape to increase that inventory.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And we're seeing some of that concern reflected within this index. But when you take a look at the outperformance of so many of these home builders, a sense that started the year, this is a group of stocks that has really been leading. One of the leaders of this rally, you had Lennar, DR Horton, among the names that are up just about 40%. So yes, we are seeing some pressure across the industry today, but certainly, when you take into account the role that some of these home builders are playing in the current market, Akiko, like you were saying.The fact that inventory is so tight, buyers who are still willing to buy in this higher mortgage rate environment they're almost left with no choice but to opt for a new home and application for mortgages to purchase new homes that rose about 36% from a year ago as we talk about some of these new homes growing their market share of the homes that are available and on the market right now. And also, in the 13 of filings that we got out last night, Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company, they're disclosing that it added positions new investments in DR Horton and Lennar and in VR. So he, at least over the last couple of months, still sees some runway here for some of these home builders.All right, let's also take a look at shares of Lyft higher today on news that its CEO David Risher bought 100,000 shares of the company according to an SEC filing. The executive purchased the shares at 11:46 on Friday, potentially signaling good things to come for the rideshare here. We're looking at a gain of nearly 4% in the stock today. And Akiko, the thought here is that an executive, if they go in and they buy the stock. They're very confident that share price is going to rise. So that's why we're seeing a bit of a movement here to the upside.So we'll see whether or not some of these gains hold because we know Lyft obviously lags far behind its biggest competitor-- its only competitor Uber really within the space and has much room to improve in order to better compete with Uber.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. And Lyft needs a bit of that vote of confidence. At least for today, we are seeing shares move higher. You could argue that things are starting to turn around for Lyft as well. Yes, they are not as diversified as Uber, as we like to talk about a lot in terms of moving outside or expanding their tentacles beyond ridesharing, but we did see a stronger outlook for Q3. Last week when they reported, we also saw the number of active riders increasing partly because of the aggressive pricing that they have done to try and compete from Uber, and that's brought revenue down, at least the average revenue for riders.But look, they have had a really tough go. It's not just the executive shakeup. It is about the competition with Uber having to have the incentives in place for the drivers, all of that leading to the declines we've seen for the company. So a new CEO coming in and buying 100,000 shares there, certainly at least a vote of confidence for today.SEANA SMITH: It is.]"

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and momentum investing, then head on over to Stocks On the Rise: 5 Best To Buy Now.After a tumultuous 2022 and a strong start to 2023, investors in the stock market are currently evaluating what's ahead. The first half of this year was a surprising one for a lot of folks, as calls for a recession and the negative impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rates were widely believed to cause damage to the market. However, big tech and mega cap stocks came to the rescue, as the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and a broader economic strength evidenced by a robust labor market and GDP growth during the second quarter removed a lot of doubts about the strength or the weakness of the stock market.Looking forward, August has been the month of earnings releases. When it comes to large companies, these reports are crucial to understanding what's happening in the economy right now and what might lie ahead. Yet, even as investors look to earnings for clarity, one thing that is clear to everyone is that the rapid rate hiking cycle that shocked markets and created turmoil in short term corporate and consumer borrowing is now entering a new phase. In this phase, the question on everyone's minds is not whether the Fed will significantly raise interest rates further. Instead, the main debate right now is for how long the rates, which currently stand at 5% - 5.25% and might be raised by 0.25% later this year, will stay at these levels before the central bank decides to cut them down and stimulate economic growth without the specter of inflation hanging over its head.On this front, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) came out with a fresh note as the second week of August was ending where it speculated about the timeline of the Fed's interest rate cuts. Goldman Sachs is one of the few banks that has been increasingly doubtful of a recession in America even as others were expecting an economic downturn to hit as soon as the start of the second half of this year. Safe to say, the bank's got a couple of things right this year, and its latest take on the interest rate question suggests that the rates should stay at high levels for nearly a year from now. Goldman's note shares that a recession alone might be insufficient to force the Fed's hand, and instead, inflation will be the driving factor behind any decision to reduce interest rates.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. economist David Mericle:(By Q2 2024), we expect core PCE inflation to have fallen below 3% on a year-on-year basis and below 2.5% on a monthly annualized basis, and wage growth to have fallen below 4% year-on-year. Those thresholds for cutting align roughly with the annual forecasts in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections and the conditions at the outset of the last cutting cycle motivated by an intent to normalize from a restrictive policy stance as inflation came down in 1995.Stocks On the Rise: Best Stocks To Buy NowIn this environment, where the market is coming off of the surprising highs that it had reached by the end of July, one strategy for investing is momentum investing. As opposed to fundamentals investing, which takes a look at a firm's business operations and its financial strength to gauge the suitability of an investment decision, a momentum based strategy focuses on the current trends in the market. This involves analyzing share price trends and movements to see which stocks are rising, and looking at indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), the volume of shares being traded on the market, and the moving averages of stock prices.

352,825c5eed-2887-38d5-89a7-ebd9a3c1b99d,ETN,2023-08-16,Eaton Corporation and Scotts Miracle-Gro Company have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-corporation-scotts-miracle-gro-112300407.html,1692098580,STORY,"['ETN', 'SMG', 'HSII', 'MAN', 'RCMT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 15, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Eaton Corporation ETN as the Bull of the Day and Scotts Miracle-Gro Company SMG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc. HSII, RCM Technologies, Inc. RCMT and ManpowerGroup Inc. MAN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Eaton Corporation, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an intelligent power management company with a strong track record of shifting its business initiatives to adapt to the world around it. Eaton began as an auto parts supplier more than a century ago, and now derives the vast majority of its revenue from electrical products. ETN shares are widely outperforming the market this year with the backing of a leading industry group. The stock is hitting all-time highs and displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.The diversified industrial company is part of the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry group, which ranks in the top 13% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry really picked up momentum over the previous 3 months:Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionEaton operates as a global power management company. Its Electrical segment provides electrical and industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, circuit protection, and power reliability equipment. In addition, this segment offers hazard and safety products such as emergency lighting, fire detection, and structural support systems.Story continuesEaton’s Aerospace segment provides pumps, motors, hydraulic power units, aircraft systems, and sealing and ducting products. Its Vehicle segment offers transmissions, clutches, hybrid power systems, engine valves, and transmission controls. Furthermore, its eMobility segment provides power distribution systems, voltage inverters, and commercial vehicle hybrid systems.Eaton has been consistently investing in research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives to introduce new and exciting products, including power management solutions that will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The company has laid out a 10-year plan that includes a $3 billion investment in R&amp;D programs.Just a few weeks ago, Eaton announced a game-changing new approach that simplifies electric vehicle fleet charging by eliminating costly cable runs and major modifications to existing parking and conveyor structures. Eaton is using electrical distribution technology to streamline fleet charging for zero-emission pickup and delivery vehicles without traditional charging pedestals.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesETN has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Earlier in August, the Dublin, Ireland-based company reported second-quarter earnings of $2.21/share, a 4.74% surprise over the $2.11 consensus estimate. Earnings grew 18.2% year-over-year, while revenues improved 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.Eaton has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.96%. Consistently beating earnings estimates is a recipe for success.Analysts covering ETN are in agreement and have been increasing their earnings estimates across the board. For the current fiscal year, analysts have bumped up earnings estimates by 3.67% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $8.76/share, reflecting potential growth of 15.72% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 10.86% to $23 billion.Let’s Get TechnicalETN shares have advanced nearly 42% this year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, ETN is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Eaton has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and ETN continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.Bottom LineThe future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. Eaton has shown an ability to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape, which puts the company in a strong position moving forward.Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.Bear of the Day:The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is involved in the manufacturing and marketing of products for lawn care, garden care, and indoor and hydroponic gardening. The company offers lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, as well as lawn-related weed, pest and disease control products. In addition, its gardening and landscape products are comprised of water-soluble and continuous release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch, and decorative groundcover products.The company sells its products under recognized brands such as Scotts, Turf Builder, EZ Seed, PatchMaster, Thick’R lawn, Miracle-Gro, Weed B Gon, and Roundup. Scotts Miracle-Gro serves home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, garden centers, food and drug stores, retailers, and indoor gardening and hydroponic distributors.The Zacks RundownScotts Miracle-Gro, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which ranks in the bottom 3% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has year-to-date:Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.SMG shares are having trouble sprouting lately. The stock experienced a climax top more than two years ago and has been in a price downtrend ever since. Shares recently gapped down following a disappointing earnings report and represent a compelling short or hedge opportunity as the market takes a breather from its strong rally this year.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating OutlookSMG has fallen short of estimates in two of the last four quarters. The lawn care company most recently reported fiscal third-quarter earnings earlier this month of $1.17/share, missing the $1.41/share consensus EPS estimate by 17.02%. Earnings declined 40.9% from the same quarter in the prior year.The stock has moved steadily lower since the announcement. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and SMG is no exception.Scotts Miracle-Gro has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by 55.56% in the past 60 days. The fiscal fourth-quarter Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now -$2.66/share, reflecting a 30.39% regression relative to the same quarter last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, SMG stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how the 50-day moving average has rolled over and is sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, SMG stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Scotts Miracle-Gro would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen more than 23% in the past 3 months alone.Despite the underperformance, SMG stock remains relatively overvalued, irrespective of the metric used:Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not due to bloom anytime soon. The fact that SMG stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Lingering high commodity costs are also a concern, which will continue to exert pressure on company margins. Potential investors may want to consider including this stock as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of an overvalued SMG until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:3 Stocks to Buy on Jobs Growth, Rise in WagesHiring has slowed in the United States but still remains high. This has left the Fed worried as it continues to struggle to bring down multi-year high inflation while higher interest rates make things difficult for the manufacturing and services sector.At the same time, wages have been increasing steadily month over month and the unemployment level remains low.The Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 187,000 in July, below the consensus estimate of 200,000. The figure is lower than the previous month's total of 209,000. However, the labor market still continues to be resilient.The economy must generate around 100,000 jobs each month to maintain pace with the expansion of the working-age population. Moreover, the report said that there are 1.6 job opportunities for every person.In July, the growth in employment was driven by robust performance in sectors such as health care, social services, financial activities and wholesale trade.Within the healthcare industry, a total of 63,000 jobs were added, largely attributed to significant hiring surges by hospitals and nursing-care facilities. Financial services added 19,000 jobs, while wholesale trade added 18,000 jobs.Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in July from 3.6% in June, reaching levels last seen more than 50 years ago. Also, hourly wages increased 0.4% in July, the same as the rise in June. On a year-over-year basis, hourly wages increased 4.4% in July.As the U.S. economy continues to witness the addition of more jobs, staffing companies are undoubtedly poised to reap rewards. Given their direct connection to job growth, they stand to gain significantly.Additionally, it's important to note that recent layoffs from various companies have prompted a greater number of people to seek new employment opportunities, which ultimately aid staffing companies. Moreover, as inflation is managed and the Federal Reserve halts its rate hikes, businesses will likely increase hiring, which will, in turn, benefit staffing firms.Stocks to WatchHeidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc. serves the executive talent and leadership needs of the world's top organizations as the premier provider of leadership consulting, culture shaping and senior-level executive search services.

AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF.Industry: Insurance - Accident &amp; HealthLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2136237/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-accident-health-insurance-industryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Inc., Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers' compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees' pay.Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers' compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees' morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.Story continuesWith commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers' compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers' compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry's performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

358,28b135f4-2b7e-38a7-b5bb-324d8cb569cd,FCX,2023-08-16,Graphite Is The Big Winner In A Multi-Trillion Dollar EV Boom,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphite-big-winner-multi-trillion-230000331.html,1692140400,STORY,"['GC=F', 'HG=F', 'GRFX', 'LAC', 'ALB', 'RIO', 'BHP', 'TECK', 'FCX', 'SCCO', 'VALE', 'SQM']","[The undeniable inevitability is that everything is going to be electrified, and batteries are our future, as well as the biggest opportunity for investors in a lifetime. Yet, the lithium space has become crowded and chaotic, while the lesser-known critical battery component—graphite—is an extraordinary $23-billion bounty ripe for picking.By 2032, it is projected to be worth an estimated $43 billion.This isn’t about pencils. It’s about the most important element of a multi-trillion-dollar energy transition. It’s about yet another 35% jump in electric vehicle sales expected for 2023, and more explosive growth to follow. It’s about the raw materials that make the batteries to feed this explosive growth.Graphite makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode) material in lithium-ion batteries, in varying natural and synthetic combinations.In fact, according to John DeMaio, CEO of Graphex Technologies and President of the Graphene Division of the Graphex Group Ltd (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX), many don’t realize that graphite is the largest component by volume in an EV battery “because graphite goes about its business, doing its job quietly, like it’s done ever since the seventies”.Any given lithium-ion battery can contain 15X more graphite than lithium, making up some 25% of a battery’s total volume. It’s also why Elon Musk once opined that lithium-ion batteries should be called “nickel-graphite batteries”.There is no immediately viable solution to effectively replace the lithium-ion battery. Industry-wide, the consensus is that graphite will remain the primary anode material in the foreseeable future.And North America has zero commercial production …Yet, planned North American battery factories represent some 1 million metric tons per year of demand for graphite anode material.That makes this $23-billion market one of the best to be in.Even more so for Graphex Group (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX), which is creating domestic supply chains of graphite, and is strategically positioned in North America to potentially seize significant market share.Story continuesMidstream Money: The Most Profitable Area of the Graphite Supply ChainOutside of China, there are very few graphite mines currently producing significant quantities of the right quality raw material. There are even fewer with the necessary experience of refining that raw material into the finished anode material we need to meet what promises to be raging demand.The most profitable aspect of the graphite supply chain is refining. Mining itself is wrought with exorbitant costs, regulatory burdens, and challenging operations.Not only is it the most profitable, but it’s also where we see the highest barrier to entry. This is a highly specialized field and battery makers need experienced refiners who can demonstrate scale. In North America, that means Graphex, which has the expertise and technology, and holds patents for everything from products and production methods to machinery design and environmental protection.Graphex Group already has a decade of commercial graphite refining experience and currently produces 10,000 metric tons of finished anode material annually, and they operate on a 24/7 basis, unlike others who have only produced sample materials at a pilot scale. This is a defining factor in the industry.There are few—if any--companies larger than Graphex in terms of production volume outside of China; and they have strong ties to Beijing, which is a riskier selling point in the current geopolitical atmosphere, heightened by a battle for technological dominance through access to critical minerals.While Graphex has extensive experience in China, it is not a Chinese company. Graphex Group Limited is a Cayman Island company with its principal offices in Hong Kong and regional offices in Shanghai and Royal Oak, Michigan, but it is seeking to create a standalone U.S. entity to “make the distinction even more clear, and to qualify unhindered for U.S. and Canadian incentives, grants, loans, etc.,” according to the company’s website.Now, it’s all about bringing critical graphene home to North American markets as the energy transition gains serious momentum.Possibly the Most Important Expansion in our Energy TransitionAlready producing 10,000 tons per annum, Graphex (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX) is currently implementing a large-scale expansion to increase production to 20,000 tons per annum within the next 12 months, with construction completion and production implementation expected to be concluded within that timeframe, subject to typical construction scheduling.The expansion news has been fast-flowing.In February last year, Graphex announced the joint-venture construction of its first-ever facility outside of Asia—in Warren, Michigan, a 15,000 tons-per-annum plant resurrected from an abandoned manufacturing sight in the Detroit automotive sector. Operations are expected to launch in Q1 2024.Graphex has prioritized North America to localize end-to-end graphite processing and production capabilities, and the 15,000 tpa plant in Michigan is a major step towards that goal.An international collaboration with Canada will also play a role, with Canada eyeing high-level status in the North American critical minerals game.Finally, Graphex has secured raw materials supply from one of the largest, high-quality graphite mines outside of China, with other offtake agreements either secured or in the works—all outside of China.Canada: Offtake/Joint venture collaboration agreement with Northern GraphiteAustralia: Offtake/Joint venture collaboration agreement with Reforme GroupBrazil: Offtake/Joint venture collaboration agreement with SouthStar Battery MetalsOfftake/Joint venture collaboration agreement with GratomicUS: Offtake/Joint venture collaboration agreement with SouthStar Battery MetalsTanzania: Offtake agreement with Volt ResourcesElectrification = Batteries. Batteries = Graphite. Graphite = Graphex.But this could go far beyond batteries and gigafactories.Graphex (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX) has undertaken extensive scientific research and sees a multitude of applications for graphene that may likely increase demand even further in the future. Graphene’s unique properties will likely have major biomedical use, specifically with targeted drug delivery, smart implants, and tissue engineering. In the industrial sector, graphene-based composites can be used as a non-toxic rust-proofing alternative, as well as an improved coating for touch screens, phones and tablets.Graphene can also be used for enhanced computer circuitry, while graphene supercapacitors are huge boosts of power with comparably little energy. Eventually, because graphene is lightweight, it could be used in the manufacture of cars and planes, significantly reducing their weight. Finally, but not exclusively, graphene ultra-sensitive sensors could detect minute airborne particles, making it a potential preventative technology for any future pandemics.Domesticating the entire graphite supply chain is a daunting task, but Graphex Group has a clear advantage in North America.This is a team of veterans led by DeMaio, who has 35 years of experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors, including as former President, CEO and Board Member of JouleSmart Solutions, general manager of Siemens Smart Infrastructure, VP of MWH Global, VP of SPG Solar and COO of Thompson Solar Technologies.It has a decade of commercial graphite refining experience, but one very distinct advantage: Its would-be competitors are new to midstream graphite. They’re only producing at lab or pilot scale, and scaling up can be accompanied by all sorts of challenges and misfires.Graphex is already producing through full-scale commercial processes with continuous output, and it’s at the forefront of creating one of the most critical North American supply chains of the coming decades.Other resource companies to keep an eye on:Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

(FCX) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-freeport-mcmoran-174005670.html,1692121205,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this mining company have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.39 per share, indicating a change of +50% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.61 points to a change of -34% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.15 indicates a change of +33.6% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.71 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.97 billion and $24.15 billion estimates indicate +0.9% and +5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has gained 17% year-to-date from its lowest point in October 2022. The rebound in stocks has increased investors' confidence in the stock market's future outlook as they are also investing more actively.This year's investment trend has pushed tech stocks into the spotlight because of the increasing fascination with artificial intelligence (AI). The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has returned 5.34% since the start of the year, underperforming the broader market by a wide margin.That said, dividend stocks are regaining attention once more. Refinitiv Lipper reported that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which follows companies increasing dividends for over 25 years, saw a strong increase of $33 million in investments over a two-week period ending on July 19. This was its biggest gain in two weeks since January.Morgan Stanley has also given a positive outlook on dividend stocks as these equities could enhance overall gains and reduce volatility in a portfolio. The firm's report highlighted that there is a possibility of lower equity returns and market uncertainty in the coming years, which could make dividends a bigger part of the overall stock market gains. Between 2013 and 2022, around 17% of the S&amp;P 500 Index's total returns were from dividends. However, over a long period of time, starting from the 1930s, dividends represented 37% of the market’s overall returns.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsDividend stocks remain on investors’ radars because even if these stocks don't do as well for a while, there's nothing like steady dividend payments, especially during turbulent times.

But how can a 25-year-old program address today's digital skills hiring trends?Now, more than ever, ‘disruption' is at the top of mind for businesses around the globe. A program such as Networking Academy, which was set up at its foundation to provide learners with the most up-to-date and in-demand technical skills, is well-placed to address the needs of the current and future global digital skills market.Change has always been at the core of the Networking Academy program's offerings.A recent WEF Future of Jobs Report found that more than 85 percent of organizations surveyed said that transformation of their organization will be driven by increased adoption of new and frontier technologies and broadening digital access.Networking Academy, through it's extensive ecosystem of education partners and flexible learning options, is training those change agents, today.About the Be the Bridge and Golden Bridge AwardsCisco Networking Academy's Be the Bridge Awards were launched during Networking Academy's first-ever virtual Global Partner Conference in May 2021 (fiscal 2020) to recognize the exemplary efforts of Networking Academy partners who lead in their dedication to achieving student success. Every Be the Bridge Award winner has excelled in one or more of the following categories: Inclusive Futures, Global Reach, Impacting Lives, Learning Innovation, and Partnerships.Additionally, in each of Cisco Networking Academy's geographic regions, a prestigious Golden Bridge Award is presented to the individual or institution that showed exceptional commitment to prioritizing student success over the previous year.The success of Cisco Networking Academy is powered by the dedication and passion of people who work towards providing equitable access to education for all. Our united purpose remains the same: to impact the lives of learners, educators, and communities through the power of technology, education, and career opportunities.Story continuesIt was my absolute pleasure to present the majority of our Golden Bridge Award winners for 2023 in-person at various Partner Conferences held from May to June. Each Be the Bridge winner in each region received a certificate of achievement, a trophy, and were entered as finalists in the annual Golden Bridge Awards, with an opportunity to celebrate their achievement through blogs and other social marketing materials. In addition, Golden Bridge Award winners receive a trophy and publicity on Cisco.com.I am thrilled to share the five Cisco Networking Academy Golden Bridge Award Winners for 2023.2023 Golden Bridge Award winnersUniversity of Information Technology and Management, PolandThis award recognizes the outstanding response and partnership to support Ukrainian refugees in building their digital skills and employability through the Start IT educational program Cisco4Ukraine. University of Information Technology and Management's (UITM) ability to scale at speed from 700 people in the pilot phase to 5,000 new registrations with the official launch of the program on February 1, 2023, shows how the partnerships with Networking Academy are impacting lives. Thank you to everyone behind this initiative.Learn more in this video.As a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, millions of Ukrainian civilians were forced to flee to other countries, mainly to Poland. According to figures from the UN refugee agency, 90 percent of these refugees were women and children. Poles opened hearts and homes to host Ukrainian refugees and help them to overcome many challenges and establish a new life.UITM is based in Rzeszów, a city in southeastern Poland and close to the Ukrainian border. As an educational institution, UITM already had long-standing relations with Ukraine. And as a Cisco Networking Academy Support Center and Instructor Training Center, UITM was well experienced in developing and delivery of educational projects for different types of learners. With the Networking Academy partnership and a Cisco Foundation training grant, UITM was able to transform the initial humanitarian support provided to the refugees into a more programmable approach, addressing the need to build digital skills, upskilling, and reskilling newcomers, and to open new opportunities for displaced Ukrainians. UITM started with a pilot program, hiring Ukrainian Networking Academy instructors to deliver the courses, and adjusted the project to the specific requirements of the Ukrainian refugees.UITM used a range of communication channels to reach the refugees, including social media, PR activities, partnerships with local governments in Poland and Ukraine, and collaboration with non-government organizations that support Ukrainian citizens.""So far, over 4,300 refugees from Ukraine have taken part in various trainings. We expect the first graduates of the full pathway in September 2023. They will then be offered the opportunity to participate in advanced training, which will last for the next few months. Meantime many learners complete the short courses and collect the digital badges offered on the Skills for All platform.The employment process is very individual and depends on many factors. Start IT Cisco4Ukraine not only gives an opportunity to learn new tech skills, reskill, upskill, and prepare for their first tech jobs but also empowers learners and creates a pipeline of talent who want to develop and achieve more. We invite the course graduates to enroll in Cisco Talent Bridge Matching Engine platform to access the opportunities advertised by the Cisco ecosystem and we provide the resources to prepare for the recruitment processes and job market demand.We are proud that the Cisco Networking Academy community appreciated our commitment to supporting refugees from Ukraine. We feel honored, but at the same time, this distinction strengthens our motivation for further action. We are very happy that the first results of this project are already visible - although the training is ongoing and the full path of training has not been completed yet, we observe that thanks to the Start IT Cisco4Ukraine project individuals are open to new opportunities and better equipped with skills critical in the digital economy. We believe that granting this award to our university will also help in the further promotion of the project and convince new learners to join our free training in the field of cybersecurity and programming.""~Lucjan Hajder, IT Director, UITMNational Information Technology Development Agency, NigeriaThis award recognizes National Information Technology Development Agency's (NITDA) partnership, under the Ministry Communications Technology and Digital Economy, in championing digital skills implementation and digital literacy and skills development programs, with the aim of reaching a 95 percent digital literacy level in the Federal Government of Nigeria by 2030.

It is an honor for us to receive this award, which recognizes the role we have played in closing digital gaps, mainly in promoting employability programs in areas such as programming, cybersecurity, networks, and the Internet of Things.""~Elena Carreras, Director, Innova Educational Development, Fundación Omar DengoEdCreate Foundation, IndiaThis award recognizes a significant milestone for EdCreate of reaching more than 100,000 students in India, making EdCreate our largest Networking Academy partner in India. We are in awe of how many underserved communities EdCreate serves in their educational focus - up to 70 or 80 percent! We are also excited to see employer partnerships in India successfully placing students in IT companies, to further create career opportunities for them.You can read more from a recent blog.""The challenges to educate underserved students in rural Indian areas are many and include infrastructure in the colleges, lack of well-equipped laboratories, workshops, and classrooms, which hinders the effective delivery of any technical education program. Regulatory challenges such as compliance with regulatory frameworks, accreditation processes, and frequent policy changes can also be a challenge for technical education institutions. Navigating these requirements while ensuring quality education becomes very demanding. We are constantly juggling the quality of the faculty, industry/academia gaps, lack of research and innovation, access and affordability, as well as the rural/urban divide.When we began our partnership with Cisco, we underestimated the magnitude of impact Cisco Networking Academy program can bring in people's lives. There is a profound effect on millions of students and their families when we create a world-class, employable, digital workforce, far beyond what the individuals, themselves, had originally anticipated, too. The journey so far has been very transformative.""Thanks to Cisco India Team and the global leadership for this continued support and their belief in our work. We are truly honored and humbled to receive the Golden Bridge Award for the second year in a row. It is a validation of the hard work and dedication that went into developing our organization as the largest Cisco Networking Academy partner in the world today.

Those pricing pressures have started to ease, but analysts have been expected a slowdown in consumer spending anyway. Tuesday's retail sales numbers showed the opposite. Both year over year and monthly readings were higher than expected.That adds more fuel to the debate on what the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates will be. Futures markets expect the Fed will pause on another rate hike when it next meets on policy in September, after raising rates by a quarter of a point in July. Many futures traders also see the Fed holding steady at other meetings this fall, while a small number see another quarter-point hike before the end of the year.But the Fed may consider the consumer price index reading for July, which came in cooler than expected, and determine that it could pause while it assesses how well its actions have taken hold to date to bring inflation back toward its 2% target.Retail earnings this week from big stores such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target could add more understanding to consumer spending trends.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Target earningsThe retailer Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.47 on revenue of $25.3 billion, while discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX)is expected to report earnings per share of 76 on revenue of $12.4 billion.2. Cisco earningsNetworking computer company Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.06 on revenue of $15.5 billion.3. FOMC minutesThe Fed's policy making panel will release the minutes of its July meeting at 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT), which could provide investors with more insight into officials' thinking on where interest rates should go for the rest of the year.Story continuesRelated ArticlesTarget earnings, Cisco reports, Fed minutes: 3 things to watchSouthwest Airlines reaches tentative agreement with transport workers unionâCAVA surges 11% on Q2 beat]"
