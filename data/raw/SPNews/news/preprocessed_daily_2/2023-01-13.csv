They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $9.03 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. FNDF, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the companies included in the Russell Developed ex-U.S. Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.91%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Shell Plc (SHEL) accounts for about 2.67% of the fund's total assets, followed by Samsung Electronics Ltd and Totalenergies (TTE).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 12.99% of FNDF's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, FNDF has added roughly 6.64%, and is down about -6.31% in the last one year (as of 01/13/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $25.15 and $34.12.The fund has a beta of 0.85 and standard deviation of 24.28% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 962 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $52.61 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $105.87 billion. VXUS has an expense ratio of 0.07% and VEA charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3,803625de-9fd7-3d8a-97c3-3cb0e0bd20c7,SCHW,2023-01-13,A Spread of Top-Ranked Value ETFs to Bet in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spread-top-ranked-value-etfs-150203617.html,1673535723,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'SCHW']","[After the biggest annual loss since 2008, Wall Street staged a strong rally at the start of 2023 on hopes of easing inflation and the Fed’s slower rate hike path. However, recession fears continued to weigh on stocks.Against this backdrop, value investing seems a prudent choice as value stocks provide investors some shelter from deep losses. That being said, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD, which targets the value segment, has risen 2.8% in the initial days of 2023 compared with a gain of 1.6% for its growth counterpart iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF.While there are many options available in this space, investors could tap the trends with ETFs having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Vanguard Value ETF VTV, iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF IVE, SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Value ETF SPYV, Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF SCHV and iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE look like compelling choices.Why Value?Value stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — and trade below their intrinsic value. These seek to capitalize on the inefficiencies in the market and have the potential to deliver higher returns with lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts. Value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets and their dividend payouts offer safety in times of market turbulence.Current Market TrendsOptimism over cooling inflation and hopes that the Fed will soon wrap up its inflation-fighting campaign have bolstered the risk appetite. The latest jobs report has added to the strength. The United States added 223,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, matching a 50-decade low. Meanwhile, wage growth lost momentum, which gave investors hope that the Fed can ease off on its interest-rate increases (read: 5 Tech ETFs Riding High on Sectors' Comeback to Start 2023).However, market participants are seeing recession anytime soon as higher interest rates have started to hurt economic growth. The International Monetary Fund warned that a third of the global economy would be in a recession given no signs of abatement of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, spiraling inflation, higher interest rates and a surge in coronavirus infections in China. The year 2023 would be ""tougher"" than last year as the United States, European Union and China may see their economies slow down.Per a Wall Street Journal survey, there is a 63% chance of recession this year. And a survey of economists and investors by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia shows the expectations that the gross domestic product will fall in three or four quarters are by far the highest since it started in 1968. Big banks are also expecting that an economic downturn is fast approaching. More than two-thirds of the economists at 23 large financial institutions that do business directly with the Federal Reserve are betting that the United States will face a recession in 2023.Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)Vanguard Value ETF targets the value segment of the broad U.S. stock market and follows the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index.

However, once that is in the rearview mirror, the focus will turn back to earnings season – which we are in the thick of currently. Below are the earnings reports to watch for the week of January 16th:Tuesday, January 17th New Oriental Education EDU is a stock that has illustrated Chinese market sentiment to perfection. In March of 2021, the stock neared $200 a share. Fast forward one year, and shares collapsed below $9 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: EDU had a nasty 2022 but shares are on the mend.The Chinese provider of language education and prep courses was adversely impacted by China’s slowing economy and stringent Covid 19 lockdown policy. Now, the Chinese government is once again unlocking their markets by lifting the lockdowns and providing stimulus to an ailing economy. Consensus analyst estimates suggest that as China’s economy normalizes, so will New Oriental Education’s earnings. If this is the case, the stock may just be starting its rebound.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Estimate Revisions are rising for EDU and other Chinese stocks.Interactive Brokers IBKR. A rising interest rate environment (like the one we’re in now) is often a headwind for most stocks. However, Interactive Brokers, a multi-asset class online broker that caters to sophisticated traders, is one exception. On its October 17th earnings call, the company announced an earnings surprise. The catalyst? IBKR saw its revenue from margin loans to customers spike dramatically as rates rose.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: IBKR hopes to keep its earnings momentum up as interest rates rise.Interactive Brokers has a healthy Expected EPS 3-5 Year Growth Rate of 22.47% and holds the best possible Zack’s #1 ranking, suggesting that last quarter’s results may not be a one-and-done. In an impressive show of relative price strength, the stock sits less than 5% off its all-time high while the major U.S. indexes remain well off their highs.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: IBKR and other stock brokers are outperforming the market in recent months.Goldman Sachs GS and Morgan Stanley MS are leading investment management and banking companies. Like most stocks, banks performed poorly last year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hold mediocre Zack’s Rankings of 3. That said, a surprise to the upside may help these stocks turn around. Valuations are getting more attractive. For example, GS has a P/E ratio of just 9.52, which compares favorably to the S&amp;P 500 Indexes 17.8.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Banks like GS are starting to get attractive on a valuation basis. We will get more info next week when they report.Another positive development in the sector is the technical picture. GS, MS, and JP Morgan JPM are all experiencing “golden crosses”. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Golden crosses favor bulls.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: GS 50-day has crossed over its 200-day moving average to signal a golden cross.United Airlines UAL, the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, has been on a tear for the past two weeks. In the upcoming quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share up a strong 230% versus last year. More importantly, Zack’s Consensus Estimates have been on the rise and have changed by 27.4% over the past 30 days. Zacks Research suggests that rising consensus estimates is one of the key ingredients to finding winning stocks. UAL currently holds an overall Zacks Ranking of 2.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: UAL is estimated to have massive growth versus last year. The stock rose yesterday even as most domestic flights were cancelled.Wednesday, airlines like Delta DAL and United rose even as a temporary grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all flights. Delta is set to report earnings Friday. With airlines like UAL up nearly 25% in the past two weeks into earnings, investors should be sizing up whether the risk-reward is worth it or if it is better to watch from the sidelines. Either way, the industry seems to be turning the corner.Wednesday, January 18thCharles Schwab SCHW is a securities brokerage, loan holding company, and asset management firm. Like its industry group peer Interactive Brokers, the stock has outperformed the general market, although it maintains a mid-tier Zack’s Ranking of 3.Alcoa AA is the leading aluminum miner in the world. Earnings and revenues are set to slow for a second straight quarter as consensus EPS estimates for the quarter have been revised lower by 33.33% over the past 30 days. A key technical zone to watch will be the 200-day moving average.

Last year, even though the company beat earnings expectations, shares stumbled as subscriber growth expectations slowed. Shares of Netflix have stormed back since making lows last May. The stock recently triggered a golden cross.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Netflix will be a big earnings report for tech. Last year shares weighed down the Nasdaq.Proctor and Gamble PG is a massive consumer products company. PG is the perfect stock for those who want to avoid drama and sleep at night. The stock has a beta of just 0.42 and pays a healthy dividend of 2.41%.American Airlines AAL will cap off earnings for the major airlines next week. AAL has seen strong buying in recent days. The stock has been up for eight straight days, of which six were on above-average volume. While it is never prudent to chase price moves, investors should keep their eye on the industry as a potential turnaround play in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has also outperformed its industry’s rise of 20.1% over the same time frame.

It is well placed to capitalize on the underlying strength in global crop protection markets thanks to high commodity prices. The strong demand environment coupled with the company’s price increase actions is driving its top line.The company, in its third-quarter call, raised its revenue outlook for 2022 to the range of $5.6-$5.8 billion (from $5.5-$5.7 billion), indicating a rise of 13% at the midpoint from 2021 levels. Sales are expected to be driven by higher volumes and prices in all regions partly offset by foreign currency headwinds. The company also now expects adjusted earnings per share for 2022 in the range of $7.10-$7.60, suggesting an increase of 7% at the midpoint from the 2021 level.FMC Corp also sees fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $1.42-$1.62 billion, reflecting an 8% rise at the midpoint compared with the prior-year quarter’s levels. Adjusted earnings are forecast in the range of $2.05-$2.55 per share, representing a rise of 9% at the midpoint from the prior-year quarter’s levels. It also expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $395-$455 million for the quarter, representing a rise of 15% at the midpoint from the prior-year quarter’s levels.The acquisition of BioPhero ApS, a Denmark-based pheromone research and production company, also adds biologically produced state-of-the-art pheromone insect control technology to the company’s product portfolio and R&amp;D pipeline, highlighting FMC's role as a leader in delivering innovative and sustainable crop protection solutions.FMC Corp also remains focused on boosting its market position and strengthening its product portfolio. It is investing in technologies and products as well as new launches to enhance value to the farmers. New products launched in Europe, North America and Asia are gaining significant traction and are contributing to volume growth.

Higher customer demand, new capacity and plant productivity improvements are supporting volumes. The La Negra III/IV expansion in Chile is also contributing to higher volumes.Strong lithium prices are also supporting ALB’s performance. Tight supply conditions and growing demand for electric vehicles are driving lithium prices. The company’s bromine business is also gaining from strong demand and favorable pricing led by tight market conditions. Albemarle is seeing strong demand for flame retardants.The company is also strategically executing its projects aimed at boosting its global lithium conversion capacity. It remains focused on investing in high-return projects to drive productivity. The company is well placed to gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market.Albemarle's Kemerton I lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Western Australia achieved first product in July 2022. The Kemerton II plant has also achieved mechanical completion. The company is also expanding lithium carbonate production at its Silver Peak site.

More clients mean higher order volumes, pickup locations and increased route density that lowers costs per order.The companies declined to comment on the number of customers it hopes to sign under this deal. They also did not disclose whether retailers will have to pay per delivery or order.The services will be offered through Salesforce's AppExchange, its app store for businesses, starting this spring.

""If you sort of removed eggs, if you took eggs out of [the 'food at home' category], it would have been virtually flat. Eggs were over 90% of that increase,"" he said. As of December, the cost of grade A large eggs per dozen was $4.25.What's behind the spike in price? The avian flu outbreak.""The total size of the U.S. egg-laying flock decreased by about 10% when roughly 40 million laying hens caught the disease and were subsequently destroyed in 2022,"" Kevin Bergquist, an analyst at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute told Yahoo Finance.As a result, the total egg production dropped by about 5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.David Anderson, professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&amp;M, said production expenses triggered record high prices, too.""Feed costs have been much higher for a couple of years now. As feed prices went up, profits went down, and the economic response to that is to produce less, so we had been producing slightly fewer egg laying chickens any way, prior to [avian flu] hitting,"" he said.Anderson added: ""A small change in supply or quantity produced generates a much larger increase in price. In other words, if the price goes up, consumers are going to buy eggs anyway, or that they will not cut back very much at all. There is really not a substitute for an egg in my egg McMuffin, or my omelette. You pretty much have to have eggs.""In addition, holiday baking led to an increase in demand, he said.Impact on retailers? As a result of supply issues, some retailers are limiting customers' egg purchases.Story continuesOn Nov. 29, Yahoo Finance spotted this sign at a BJ's Wholesale Club limiting 2 egg cartons per a customer. BJ's did not respond to a request for comment.A Whole Foods in Brooklyn recently imposed a similar limit.Taken at a BJ's Wholesale Club in New York on Nov. 29th, 2022 (Courtesy: Yahoo Finance).Other major retailers are holding off on limits.A Target (TGT) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we are experiencing low inventory of some egg products, it ultimately depends on the brand. We are not limiting guest purchases at this time.""The current average sale price of Target's private label 12 count of Good &amp; Gather conventional eggs is $4.26, a cent higher than the current national average for U.S. cities.A Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we have some regions of the country that have seen some tightness in supply, we are seeing improved supply on eggs right now and have recovered from a challenging holiday season which had very high demand and impacts due to avian flu ... We do not have any purchase limits on eggs.""When will prices go down? With the Easter Holiday around the corner, it may take a while for consumers to see relief in egg prices.""We typically see egg prices peak in the spring, especially table eggs because of Easter and Easter egg hunts. That provides a boost to egg demand and prices. That is coming up pretty soon, so that demand will likely keep egg prices high in coming months,"" Anderson said.Anderson is optimistic, though.""I do expect as we go further into 2023 that increases in production will begin to catch up to and surpass the disease losses so production will expand, we’ll get back to the 327 million or so egg layers and prices will come down,"" Anderson said.Wells Fargo's Bergquist was confident, too, saying, ""We expect a slight decline between now and Easter, when prices will likely spike again. However, we don’t anticipate a retraction back to pre-bird flu levels. If the outbreak dissipates over the next six months, flock-laying birds will slowly rebuild, increasing egg supplies and helping alleviate high egg prices in the long term. Summer egg prices are usually much lower than the holiday seasons, and that could happen again in 2023.""And per the USDA, inventory is on the rise and prices are starting to fall.""During the last week of 2022, inventory sizes started to rise, and prices fell. Going forward, wholesale prices are expected to decrease as the industry moves past the holiday season and continues rebuilding its egg-laying flocks.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Walmart is looking to sell more of its tech to other companies. The big box retailer is teaming up with software giant Salesforce to boost the use of its Go Local and store assist offerings. Both will become available through Salesforce's app store. The move part of Walmart's wider strategy to diversify away from retail. Go Local was launched in 2021 in a bid by the company to build alternative revenue streams. The nation's biggest grocer has been one of many retailers battling higher inflation. It gave a cautious outlook in December after slashing profit forecasts over the summer.A batch of classified documents have been found at a second location belonging to President Biden. This is according to various media reports after an initial report by NBC News. The White House was already contending with revelations that classified files were discovered last November at a think tank office that Biden used after he served as vice president. It appears the classification level of the new set of files is still unclear. Last year, of course, the FBI seized boxes of classified documents from the Mar-a-Lago residence of Donald Trump. That's after the former president refused to turn them over. The Biden documents were submitted voluntarily.And Amazon's labor unions' groundbreaking breaking victory in Staten Island last year should be recognized. This is according to a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board. Last spring, the union won the right to represent around 8,000 workers at the JFK warehouse in New York.

Growing demand for energy-efficient building products and a strong backlog level also bode well for the segment. The Henry acquisition and solid non-residential demand are driving the Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies (CWT) segment.Robust demand in the medical technologies and commercial aerospace business is supporting CSL’s Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) segment. The Carlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT) segment will benefit from its focus on product introductions, price discipline and growing backlog level.The company acquired MBTechnology in February 2022. The buyout strengthened its product-building platform and boosted its energy-efficient solution offerings. Also, the Henry Company acquisition in September 2021 boosted Carlisle’s product offerings for construction activities. It is worth noting that acquisitions boosted revenues by 9.2% in third-quarter 2022.Under the Vision 2025 program, Carlisle looks forward to achieving above-market organic growth, acquiring new assets and leveraging its Carlisle Operating System (COS) to drive efficiencies through business processes apart from returning cash to its shareholders.

However, a decline in traffic from pre-pandemic levels is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthSolid domestic operations bode well for the company. During the third quarter of 2022, the company benefited from strong leisure demand and better convention business in the Las Vegas market. During the quarter, net revenues at Las Vegas Strip Resorts were $ 2,301 million, up 66.6% year over year. The company benefited from increased business volume and travel activity on a year-over-year basis. The addition of The Cosmopolitan and Aria added to the upside. The company anticipates the momentum to continue owing to the strength in weekend ADR’s. During the quarter under review, net revenues from the company's regional operations totaled $973.9 million, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The upside was primarily driven by increased business volume and travel activity. The company remains bullish on its domestic business outlook. Much optimism can be noted owing to attributes such as a rebound in convention business and increased international flight capacity.Sports betting and iGaming continues to be major growth driver for the company. To this end, BetMGM continues to gain market share. Since its launch in 2018, the company has done extremely well and operates in 24 markets. It also announced a partnership with Carnival cruises to provide onboard ship betting and gaming under the BetMGM brand. During the third quarter, net revenues from BetMGM operations came in at $400 million, suggesting growth of 90% year over year. Also, the company stated that BetMGM’s revenues associated with operations surpassed a billion dollars through the first nine months of 2022. Given the positive momentum in markets coupled with its unique and unparalleled online and offline offerings, the company is optimistic about long-term growth, with revenue expectations of more than $1.3 billion in 2022. MGM expects to achieve positive EBITDA in 2023. The company is confident about the improved design and functionality of the BetMGM app launch (of a single wallet) and omnichannel growth prospects.MGM Resorts is focusing on an asset-light strategy. The company continues to emphasize on monetizing its real estate assets and bolstering its domestic cash position. To this end, the company has simplified its structure by selling MGP (to VICI for $4.4 billion), The Mirage (to Hard Rock for $1.075 billion) and Gold Strike Tunica (to Cherokee Nation for $450 million). This apart, the company has initiated strategic changes with respect to taking over City Center operations. Also, it acquired the hotel operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (from Blackstone for $1.625 billion). We believe that the transactions are likely to enhance and diversify the company’s offerings in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past three months, shares of MGM Resorts have gained 25.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 20.3%.ConcernsThe Gaming industry is currently grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and MGM Resorts isn’t immune to the trend. During third-quarter 2022, the company witnessed a dismal performance in the Macau region owing to subdued visitation. During the third quarter, MGM China's net revenues fell 69.7% year over year to $87.5 million. Notwithstanding the easing of certain COVID-19 protective measures by authorities worldwide, certain travel restrictions, quarantine measures, testing requirements and capacity limitations remain in effect at its Macau Operations. Although the company resumed operations in most of its properties, traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels. Given the uncertainties around the crisis, the company expects the pandemic to keep affecting operations for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMGM Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The independent research firm claims the decline to be the largest since it has been tracking the PC market since the mid-1990s.Why is PC Sales Collapsing?Gartner opines that the year-over-year decline was mainly due to weakening consumer demand for PCs and high inventory levels. Softening IT spending amid the ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in a decline in demand for PCs.Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnComputer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnComputer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnIn 2020 and 2021, PC manufacturers benefited from increased demand amid the pandemic-induced remote-working and online-learning wave. The pandemic necessitated using PC systems for remote work, web-based learning, video conferencing, video gaming, social media, consumer entertainment and streaming or online shopping.However, the recent back-to-back four quarters of declining PC shipments depict an end to the industry’s demand boom. We believe that consumers have become more cautious about their spending due to inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and fears of a possible recession. Furthermore, Enterprises are delaying their large IT spending amid the macroeconomic challenges.Gartner, in its report, pointed out that though supply-chain challenges have eased, higher inventory level has become a major issue due to softened demand for consumers and commercial PCs.Vendor-Wise PC ShipmentsGartner revealed that all vendors registered steep year-over-year declines in their PC sales volumes.

They also reduced the size of their expected British contraction to 0.7% from 1%.They are unlikely to be alone.""One of the main sources of downside risk for economic activity in the euro zone is dissipating,"" said UniCredit economist Edoardo Campanella.Campenella pointed out that about 85% of European Union gas storage capacity is still untapped - levels normally seen in October before gradually being drawn down as winter needs are met. And if the experience of 2011-2019 period is extrapolated, that could mean storage levels end the winter in April well in excess of 50% - providing a hefty buffer for next winter too.That much is clear from gas contract prices.

They also reduced the size of their expected British contraction to 0.7% from 1%.They are unlikely to be alone.""One of the main sources of downside risk for economic activity in the euro zone is dissipating,"" said UniCredit economist Edoardo Campanella.Campenella pointed out that about 85% of European Union gas storage capacity is still untapped - levels normally seen in October before gradually being drawn down as winter needs are met. And if the experience of 2011-2019 period is extrapolated, that could mean storage levels end the winter in April well in excess of 50% - providing a hefty buffer for next winter too.That much is clear from gas contract prices. Not only have short-term benchmark Dutch contracts dropped more than 54% over the past month - down 72% from August peaks - but contracts for the next winter are also down by equivalent amounts.Story continuesThe weird weather has played a huge part.

In 2023, palm oil output is expected at 50.82 million tonnes and exports 26.42 million, it said.On Thursday, Malaysia said it could stop exporting palm oil to the European Union in response to a new EU law aimed at protecting forests by strictly regulating sales of the product.Malaysian benchmark palm oil futures are expected in a range of 4,000-4,200 ringgit ($920-$970) per tonne this year, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Director General Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir.That's lower than a record average of 4,910 ringgit in 2022, with prices skewed higher by disruption to edible oil supplies and distribution by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it's still comparatively high. Prices averaged 3,260 ringgit a tonne between 2018 and 2022.On Friday, Malaysian palm futures were trading near a three-week low around 3,860 ringgit. [POI/]Other threats to edible oil supplies include Argentina's worst drought in 60 years, which is forecast to cut its soybean output to 41 million tonnes, down from 48 million previously estimated.STRONG DEMANDIndia's palm oil imports in December jumped 94% from a year earlier to a record high as the product's higher discount to rival vegetable oils led refiners to boost purchases.""Palm oil's discount to rival oils is around $300 a tonne, we expect this discount to narrow to around $200 by March,"" said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage.""But India's strong demand for palm oil will continue as it is still the cheapest edible oil.""Palm oil purchases by China, the world's second-largest importer, are also expected to climb this year, after dropping sharply in 2022 because of Beijing's then strict COVID controls.($1 = 4.3350 ringgit)(Reporting by Naveen Thukral and Bernadette Christina; Additional reporting by Fransiska Nangoy in Jakarta and Mei Mei Chu in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Tom Hogue and John Stonestreet)]"

Many crypto traders and traditional economists took the report as a sign that the Federal Reserve can soon declare victory in its campaign to bring down inflation, which means risky assets won't have to face stiff monetary-policy tightening pressure for much longer.Bitcoin (BTC) posted its biggest one-day return in two months, shooting up 5% to surpass the $19,000 level that the largest cryptocurrency hadn't seen since the market tremors first started to appear in the moments when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange and crypto empire first started to unravel.""If we can take out that $19K level, then we are definitely en route for $21K,"" Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk TV's ""All About Bitcoin"" show.CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. took a deep dive into the inflation figures and argues it might be too soon to get excited about a Fed pivot. Traders in fixed-income markets are pricing in expectations of a 0.25 percentage point hike at the Fed's next meeting – a slowdown from the recent pace. Fed officials assert that while the pace of hiking may slow, the campaign itself isn't on the verge of ending anytime soon – with many more hikes to come. ""The market does not believe that,"" Joe Orsini, vice president of research for Eaglebrook Advisors, told CoinDesk TV.Story continuesDexterity Capital's Michael Safai said in emailed remarks that, this week's rally notwithstanding, the lingering malaise from last year's crypto-industry meltdown is just too much to shrug off, just yet. In fact, late Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a lawsuit that the crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital sold unregistered securities – adding to the drama and speculation over the future of Digital Currency Group (which also owns CoinDesk).""We still have a couple of big shakeouts left in crypto, with some bankruptcy messes that have to be sorted and other firms still fighting to stay solvent,"" Safai said. ""This will have a bigger impact on prices over the next couple of months.”InsightsCrypto Bridges Had a Horrid 2022, But Security Firms Say This Year Doesn’t Have to Be as BadBy Shaurya MalwaA key part of the crypto ecosystem has received harsh criticism over the past several months because of its importance and yet fragile architecture, which led to an estimated $2 billion in losses in 2022.Bridges, or blockchain-based tools that connect different networks, are essential for the movement of liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. Bridges allow users to transfer tokens and other digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), between various chains – solving what was previously a difficult problem.Bridges allow users to port assets across different blockchains, solving one of the main pain points – a lack of interoperability among the chains. And since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.This is where the potential for an exploit lies. Last year, February saw Wormhole’s $375 million exploit, followed by a $625 million exploit of Ronin Bridge the next month. Then in August, Nomad Bridge was attacked for $190 million.However, security firms such as OpenZeppelin say bridges aren’t inherently susceptible to attacks and that security features built during the ongoing bear market make for an opportune time for developers to reinforce features.“Cross-chain bridges need to maintain access to a large reserve of funds to underwrite the coins they wrap and transfer, so this makes them a prime target for attackers,” Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin, told CoinDesk in a recent chat.He added that while bridges may always remain a target for hackers, the usage of continuous security monitoring would make them less vulnerable. “Most bridges are inherently centralized in key areas so they have a lot of power available to respond to and contain attacks, but only if they do so quickly,” Lewellen said.Among Lewellen’s solutions are the use of real-time security and monitoring features that kick in as soon as an exploit is detected. This may mean deploying smart contracts that block the transfer of funds over a bridge, or even lock the funds on the bridge itself, could they be flagged as a breach.Such an approach may be more beneficial compared to relying on audits, a newly formed crypto industry where developers try to attack protocols to locate flaws apart from proof-reading one’s code.“Pre-launch audits of the code underpinning liquidity pools have proved to be insufficient in anticipating the likelihood of their falling prey to security failures,” Lewellen said. “For developers to maintain the security of their protocols, real-time security practices need to be sustained after launch to keep them alert to how their protocols are operating under real-world usage.”Such steps would still not keep all attackers at bay, Lewellen warns. “Many attackers will use both technical exploits and malicious trading practices to seize funds in unexpected ways,” he said.As of the time of this writing, there’s still over $6 billion locked on blockchain bridges, data from DeFiLlama shows.Important events9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) Europe's Industrial Production s.a.

Particularly from private equity firms that operate in the tech space – like Thoma Bravo, Vista, and Silver Lake – and large-cap tech buyers themselves, like Amazon, Salesforce, and Oracle,"" said Ansari.Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and Oracle (ORCL) have all been active acquirers in recent years, though tech M&amp;A notably slowed in 2022 as the economy took a turn for the worse. However, slowdown aside, 2022 wasn't a total wash when it came to deals. In particular, Ansari highlighted Microsoft's (MSFT) proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Broadcom's (AVGO) $61 billion buyout of VMWare (VMW), and Adobe's (ADBE) $20 billion deal to buy interface design app Figma.There will be rough patches ahead for some deals, of course. For example: Microsoft's Activision buyout – set to be worth a whopping $69 billion – has been challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which under Chair Lina Khan has taken an active stance on reeling in Big Tech. But that aside, deals are there to be made.""I've actually been surprised there haven't been more deals because you have a combination of a lot of dry powder, both for mega-tech names and others,"" Ansari said. ""So, just giant cash stockpiles, and private equity firms that have very large cash stockpiles of funds they've raised. By the same token, you have valuation declines in both the public market and the private market. I think the opportunity is really ripe right now in the coming months for us to see quite a few M&amp;A transactions happening.""Story continuesAn image of a handshake with one hand as a cursor. Getty Creative.IPOs back, too?Though it's not imminent, we could soon see an uptick in tech IPOs. Ansari told Yahoo Finance we'll see at least some big-name public offerings this year, though perhaps not until the back half of 2023.""In the tech space, I think you have a number of companies, SpaceX and Stripe being the biggest, most-anticipated, most-IPO-ready,"" he said. ""They've been thinking about it and putting things in place for years to be able to make that happen."" (Recently, Stripe reportedly cut its internal valuation by 11% to $63 billion.)Additionally, Ansari flagged Instacart and Databricks as similarly ""well-positioned"" to go public. Instacart's particularly ready to roll, he said.""They're not looking for the perfect valuation,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""I think they've cut their internal valuation from $40 billion down to $10 billion and they're being realistic about market expectations. That's a business that also has $2 billion in revenue and has turned profitable. I think they're well-positioned to come out.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

More clients mean higher order volumes, pickup locations and increased route density that lowers costs per order.The companies declined to comment on the number of customers it hopes to sign under this deal. They also did not disclose whether retailers will have to pay per delivery or order.The services will be offered through Salesforce's AppExchange, its app store for businesses, starting this spring.

Walmart is looking to sell more of its tech to other companies. The big box retailer is teaming up with software giant Salesforce to boost the use of its Go Local and store assist offerings. Both will become available through Salesforce's app store. The move part of Walmart's wider strategy to diversify away from retail. Go Local was launched in 2021 in a bid by the company to build alternative revenue streams. The nation's biggest grocer has been one of many retailers battling higher inflation. It gave a cautious outlook in December after slashing profit forecasts over the summer.A batch of classified documents have been found at a second location belonging to President Biden. This is according to various media reports after an initial report by NBC News. The White House was already contending with revelations that classified files were discovered last November at a think tank office that Biden used after he served as vice president. It appears the classification level of the new set of files is still unclear. Last year, of course, the FBI seized boxes of classified documents from the Mar-a-Lago residence of Donald Trump. That's after the former president refused to turn them over. The Biden documents were submitted voluntarily.And Amazon's labor unions' groundbreaking breaking victory in Staten Island last year should be recognized. This is according to a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board. Last spring, the union won the right to represent around 8,000 workers at the JFK warehouse in New York. The NLRB ruling was in response to Amazon contesting the vote. Amazon claiming it was improperly influenced by union organizers. Amazon is expected to appeal this new ruling. The worker effort, of course, was spearheaded by former Amazon employee Chris Smalls. He's since become something of a spokesman for the labor movement.]"

The smaller-than-expected fine, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter, propelled the share prices.This telecommunications equipment provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.7%.

The commission has argued that the deal would hinder competition in the video-game industry and has scheduled an in-house trial for August. Either company could be called to testify as part of the FTC trial.Google and Nvidia provided information that backs a key FTC contention — that Microsoft could gain an unfair advantage in the market for cloud, subscription and mobile gaming — according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. In its remarks to the FTC, Nvidia stressed the need for equal and open access to game titles but didn’t directly oppose the acquisition, according to one of the people.Microsoft first announced the Activision deal almost a year ago, looking to add blockbuster games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to a business that already includes the Xbox console, the Halo franchise and Minecraft world-building software. But regulators fear that Microsoft could make it harder for rival platforms to get unfettered access to Activision’s most popular titles.Shares of Activision dipped to session lows after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock is currently trading at $76.75 in New York, well below the $95-a-share bid, suggesting that investors see closing the deal as an uphill fight. Microsoft rose less than 1% to $237.88.Story continuesRead more: Microsoft’s Activision fight is a bet on the future of gamingNvidia and Google are both major forces in the industry. Nvidia leads the market for graphics cards prized by gamers and operates a streaming service called GeForce Now. Google competes with Microsoft in cloud-computing services and offered an unsuccessful game service called Stadia that is shutting down this month.Google’s Android mobile operating system also is central to how millions of people play video games. Sony, whose PlayStation console competes with Microsoft’s Xbox, has previously argued that it sees the Activision deal as anti-competitive.Representatives for Google and Nvidia declined to comment.Microsoft said it’s open to addressing concerns about the deal. It reached a 10-year pact to bring Activision’s Call of Duty to Nintendo Co. gaming platforms and agreed to release future versions of the game on Valve Corp.’s Steam platform at the same time as they debut on Xbox.“We are prepared to address and have been proactively addressing issues raised by regulators or competitors to ensure that the deal closes with confidence,” Microsoft spokesman David Cuddy said. “We want people to have more access to games, not less.”Still, the feedback adds heft to the argument that Microsoft could tie more exclusive content to its Xbox Game Pass service, which already leads the market for gaming subscriptions. In its defense, Microsoft has said that regulators are giving too much weight to concerns raised by Sony. In addition to publicly decrying the transaction, Sony has said in filings with Brazilian and UK regulators that the deal will harm competition and give Microsoft an insurmountable edge in the nascent cloud gaming industry.In its own filings, Microsoft has said that Sony’s concerns are “self-serving” and overstate the importance of Activision’s catalog. The software giant also has attempted to make concessions. It offered Sony a 10-year deal that would give the PlayStation console access to Call of Duty. A person familiar with those discussions said the offer also included the right to place the games on Sony’s subscription services.Read more: FTC says no settlement talks are underway on Microsoft dealGoogle’s Stadia spotlighted the challenges of competing in cloud gaming. It was launched in 2019 with original content, and the company hired hundreds of game developers to work on the project. But Stadia never caught on with gamers, and Google announced plans in September to close the platform. It’s set to wind down on Jan. 18.Politico reported in November, prior to the FTC’s lawsuit, that Google had concerns about the Activision deal.Nvidia, meanwhile, opened its GeForce Now service to the public in 2020, providing access to high-end gaming hardware over the internet. The company allows subscribers to play games they already own, streamed from its servers.Last August, Nvidia said it had 20 million subscribers. More recently, the company said it’s able to support more than 1,400 titles, allowing consumers to use basic devices such as Chromebooks and handhelds to play the most demanding games.But Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which includes cloud gaming in its Ultimate package, remains the leading service — with more than 25 million subscribers. In part, that’s because Microsoft’s dozens of game studios provide a direct channel of content. Activision is expected to make the subscription service even more compelling.(Updates with Microsoft comment in the ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekIt’s a Business Free-for-All in a Russia Transformed by SanctionsThe Winklevii Are the Latest Crypto Founders to Blame Everybody But ThemselvesWhat Tech Job Cuts Say About Silicon Valley—and the Rest of the EconomyAirlines Resurrect Ancient Jumbo Jets to Meet First- and Business-Class DemandWith VC Funding Drying Up, Biotechs Are on a Quest for Cash©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The Verge added that the company — which also owns LinkedIn — will offer “10 corporate holidays, leaves of absence, sick and mental health time off, and time away for jury duty or bereavement alongside this new unlimited time off policy.” In addition, for those who have unused vacation days, they will get a one-time payout in April.This perk, however, can become problematic when managers require work or duties that leave little or no room for employees’ time off, Bloomberg explained.Take Our Poll: If Elon Musk Offered You a Job Paying You More Than You Make Today, Would You Work for Him?A Microsoft spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company had taken this factor into account and that it will ensure workers get adequate vacation time.In addition, this benefit can be a blessing for employers, as “employees who quit or are fired don’t have to be compensated for accrued, unused time,” Bloomberg explained.Katherine Dumanoir, a sourcing lead at Microsoft, said in a Jan. 11 LinkedIn post that for the policy to be a success, one has to work for a good boss or leadership, take accountability for work responsibilities, and make sure they actually take time off.Story continues“Only reason why I am a skeptic of unlimited PTO is because there’s no protection for the employee. It’s at the discretion of leadership and there are no pay outs for days not used in the case of a layoff. Will your days away be used against you if they are greater than your colleagues? What is an appropriate amount to take?” she wrote in the post.California Big Tech Salaries Revealed: State Law Exposes How Much These Jobs Really PayFind: 5 (Really Good) Reasons You Should Quit Your Job Now Despite Economic UncertaintyDumanoir added, however, that the reasons she likes this change is that for employees who working hard and hit goals, they won’t be limited in the amount of time they can take off.

Shipments of PCs fell a whopping 28% year-over-year in Q4, according to Gartner, and the market likely won’t return to growth for some time.But Microsoft (MSFT) and its PC manufacturing partners are pushing forward regardless of the downturn, rolling out a slew of new features and capabilities that they believe will draw in consumers ranging from the average person to hardcore gamers.“In the current climate, customers are being thoughtful about purchase decisions, and that’s true for PCs as well,” Microsoft chief partner officer and CVP for global partner solutions Nicole Dezen told Yahoo Finance. “Our partners are focused on building the right PCs, with the right features and value for the price point.”Throughout 2023, PC makers are debuting everything from systems with new AI chips to high-powered gaming rigs. During CES 2023 in Las Vegas, chip makers Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD) each debuted new offerings, including what Intel says is the “fastest mobile chip in the world,” Nvidia’s high-end RTX 4090 mobile graphics chip and AMD’s Ryzen 7045HX processor.An Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop with eye tracking for glasses free 3D video gaming is displayed at the Microsoft Inc. booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2023. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Part of the pitch for PCs in 2023 comes in the form of new AI capabilities that companies say will improve things like video chat quality over computers without AI features.“Partners are integrating AI chips and workloads into their Windows PCs for improved customer experiences in areas like gaming, video conferencing and computer augmentation,” Dezen explained.It’s not just AI and high-powered processors, though. Dezen says that her customers regard security as a top priority for their systems.Getting consumers and businesses to purchase new PCs in 2023, however, will be a tall order regardless of how many new features PC makers offer.“The anticipation of a global recession, increased inflation, and higher interest rates have had a major impact on PC demand,” Mikako Kitagawa, director analyst at Gartner said in a statement.Story continues“Since many consumers already have relatively new PCs that were purchased during the pandemic, a lack of affordability is superseding any motivation to buy, causing consumer PC demand to drop to its lowest level in years.”We’ll just have to see if Microsoft and its partners can overcome the collapse in demand, and help pull the PC market back to growth.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanApple says it’s paid out $320 billion to developers since 2008 as App Store fight heats upCES 2023: One of the most popular gadgets at the show goes in your toiletBMW debuts i Vision Dee concept, a car that can change colors and smile at youGot a tip?

The software giant joining a growing list of companies offering their employees unlimited paid time off. The company's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, making the announcement in-- announcing the change in an email this week. Microsoft workers will also get 10 corporate holidays, a leave of absence privileges, as well as sick and mental health days and bereavement time.Dave, this is just another example of a company here trying to place-- trying to put their workers first, try to really do all they can to attract that top talent, to keep their top talent. It will be interesting, though, to look at the trends of whether or not people do take more time off, whether or not they stay in because a lot of this survey shows that the companies that offer unlimited time off, their workers actually, in fact--DAVE BRIGGS: Take less.SEANA SMITH: --take less vacation.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, first read, it sounds like it's a trap. That's the Star Wars reference. I don't know if you know Admiral Akbar. You're probably far too young to know that. But at first glance, yes, it makes you feel like, well, if I take three weeks, are they going to punish me? But when you dive deeper into Microsoft's policy, actually, this reads genuine because they have encouraged as much remote time and more workers to work remote as they possibly can.So those people that actually are able to work remote, I think this plays well into someone who wants to go on a three-week vacation and work from Hawaii or Mexico or whatever it may be. I do genuinely feel like unlimited time off is a gimmick, is something that no employee is going to take advantage of because you know at the end of the day, you all have year end reviews. And you're going to be renewed based on that. And so, yeah, I don't think this largely plays out the way it sounds on the surface.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: I don't think so, too. And there certainly has been a number of studies looking into this. There was a recent one from Namely, which is an HR company, and they looked into the people that were offered unlimited time off versus those that weren't. And those that were offered unlimited time off, they took an average of 13 vacation days, comparing that to an average of 15 vacation days for workers who were given a set amount. So it was only a difference of two days.But the stat that actually stood out to me or the findings in this report were that the employees that were given unlimited time off, they were twice as likely as those that were not to work on vacation.DAVE BRIGGS: Yes, and there, I think, is the key with Microsoft. Let me ask you, if you were offered unlimited time off, how much do you think you would realistically take?SEANA SMITH: I don't think it would be any different from what I take today. I already don't use all of my time off. I far from use all the time off.DAVE BRIGGS: The other read here is that some people fear this is so they never have to buy back vacation days because built into this new policy, they are, in April, going to pay off any unused vacation days. So in theory, they will never have to do that again. That is potentially a huge cost savings for a company like Microsoft because that is the policy that no longer exists.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly an interesting way to look at it and also will be interesting to see if some of these other tech giants also follow Microsoft's footsteps and offer that because we know competition for some of those workers is very, very fierce.DAVE BRIGGS: We're so skeptical. Maybe they're just being genuinely--SEANA SMITH: We'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: --caring about their employees.SEANA SMITH: I like it. We'll leave it there.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt.SEANA SMITH: OK. We both should.]"

CVS stock has been in a slight downtrend after news broke that the company could acquire Oak Street Health OSH for $10 billion.Still, the top line growth for CVS has been solid, and Oak Street Health could be a nice addition to CVS’s revenue with OSH sales expected to jump 43% in FY23 to $3.06 billion. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDillard’s DDS: One retail company that particularly sticks out from a valuation standpoint is Dillard’s. Improved consumer data could get DDS stock rallying again trading at just 8.5X forward earnings.Despite a dip expected in the company’s fiscal 2024 earnings, Dillard’s bottom line is still massive and earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMacy’s M: Another retail company that sticks out from a valuation standpoint is omnichannel retailer Macy’s, which trades at just 5.3X forward earnings. Macy’s earnings had slowly but surely begun to stabilize as the company adjusts to the new age of retail shopping. And a stronger consumer would be helpful as the company’s fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip below pre-pandemic levels of $4.18 per share in 2019.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverstock.com OSTK:  E-commerce provider Overstock could see its stock boosted from a stronger consumer which would be greatly beneficial to the company’s continued growth. Overstock saw stellar growth during the pandemic and this could continue with fiscal 2023 sales forecasted to stabilize and rise 1% to $2.04 billion after a -27% fall from FY21 sales of $2.76 billion. Shares of OSTK are still 64% from their highs making the stock a rally prospect if deflation continues.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalgreens Boots Alliance WBA: Rounding out the list we go back to the pharmaceutical retail space with Walgreens Boots Alliance.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share, indicating a change of -30.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 points to a change of -10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $33.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.5%. The $133.89 billion and $138.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Entries are being accepted now through March 31, 2023.""Every generation has unique challenges representing the present times. Although Expressions was launched by Walgreens more than a decade ago, it will be relevant for generations to come as it is designed to encourage teens to use self-expression to help them reach their full potential,"" said John Gremer, senior director, Community Relations, Walgreens. ""Expressions began out of a desire to help young people handle the tough issues they may be facing. Helping high school students find their voices through art lines up perfectly with our commitment to create more joyful lives through better health.""Research shows that teens today care about lots of issues, from navigating high school to the global environment. However, mental health, specifically anxiety and depression, ranks highest1. Expressions was created to empower teen participants to use art to voice opinions on issues most important to them. This is especially important as psychologists tout the therapeutic benefits of artistic expression as having the potential to decrease anxiety and feelings of anger and depression.Last year’s winners included teens like Isabela Arca of California. The high school student won first place in visual arts for her piece, ""Avoidance,"" after working with art therapist Marilynn Record.""Isabela was very shy and sad before we started using her art to express her feelings,"" said Record. ""Entering the challenge was an enormous step for her. And when she won, it brought her out of her shell even more.""Story continues""I was shocked,"" said Arca about winning first place. ""For people like me who don’t really like opening up to others or trusting anyone, I really think art is a really good way to cope with your emotions.""Teens whose parents or guardians work for Walgreens are not eligible.

It starts on January 30. Those within a commuting distance will return in person for at least three days a week. What's interesting to me, I guess, Sozz, as we hear more and more companies announcing this, is not just that they're asking people to come back.That doesn't necessarily shock me. It's that they're still doing hybrid. They're not asking everybody to come back all-- every day, right? So this just reflects that things have changed, at least for now. And I'm still wondering whether that is the future of work that is here, and it's permanent, or if a year or two years from now, people are going to be there five days a week.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and you have Snap as well add to the list here, Julie. Soon employees will have to be back in the office 80% of the time, which essentially works out to four days a week. So there does look to be that hybrid component moving forward. But it also comes at the time, Julie, where, look, companies are trying to get as much efficiency out of their business. And maybe that revolves around employees being back in the office, collaborating and maybe just coming up with ideas--[BUZZER]--that could drive sales in what could be a very challenging year economically.]"

However, the payout ratio and the growth prospects of the company are equally important, as they are the determinants of future dividend growth.In this article, we will discuss the prospects of three stocks with solid dividend growth records, promising growth prospects and exceptionally low payout ratios. These dividend stocks have the potential to grow their dividends quickly for several years.PHParker-Hannifin$309.46WSMWilliams-Sonoma$121.92FULH.B. Fuller$73.09InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsParker-Hannifin (PH)Back View of the Head of the Project Holds Laptop and Discussing Product Details with Chief Engineer while They Walk Through Modern Factory., FR rents out these spaces in the U.S.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comParker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH) is a diversified industrial manufacturer that specializes in motion and control technologies. The company was founded in 1917 and has grown to a market capitalization of $37 billion.Parker-Hannifin has a key difference from most industrial manufacturers. Its products are obscure but critical for the operations of its customers. As a result, the demand for these products remains robust even during adverse economic periods. Therefore, the company is more resilient to recessions than most industrial manufacturers.The strength of the business model of Parker-Hannifin is clearly reflected in its exceptional performance record. During the last nine years, the company has essentially tripled its earnings per share, from $6.26 in 2013 to $18.72 in 2022. The company has grown its bottom line in eight of the last nine years. A consistent growth record is a testament to a wide business moat.Parker-Hannifin has exhibited such a strong performance record primarily thanks to a series of acquisitions. It has acquired smaller competitors and has achieved great synergies. The latest acquisition was the one of Meggitt for $8.8 billion in cash four months ago. Meggitt, which generates annual sales of $2.3 billion, sells technology and products on every major aircraft platform. The takeover of Meggitt is likely to prove a major growth driver for Parker-Hannifin in the upcoming years.Story continuesLike all the global industrial manufacturers, Parker-Hannifin is currently facing some strong headwinds, namely high cost inflation and the rally of the dollar to a multi-year high. Nevertheless, the business momentum of the company is intact. In its fiscal first quarter, Parker-Hannifin grew revenues 12% over the prior year’s quarter and EPS 11%, from $4.26 to $4.74, thanks to robust demand in every region. Parker-Hannifin exceeded the analysts’ consensus by an impressive 57 cents and posted record sales and EPS for a first quarter. Notably, the industrial manufacturer has exceeded the analysts’ EPS estimates for 29 consecutive quarters.Parker-Hannifin also has an outstanding dividend growth record. It is a Dividend King, with 72 consecutive years of dividend payments and 66 consecutive years of dividend growth.The only caveat is the lackluster dividend yield of 1.8% of the stock. However, it is important to realize that the payout ratio of the stock is only 28%. In other words, the company could afford a much higher dividend, but it prefers to preserve cash to fund future acquisitions.Parker-Hannifin has grown its dividend by 12% per year on average over the last decade and by 14% per year on average over the last five years. Given its low payout ratio and promising growth prospects, the company can easily continue raising its dividend at a double-digit rate for many more years.Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a specialty retailer that operates home furnishing and houseware brands, such as Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and others. The retailer operates traditional retail locations but also sells its products through e-commerce and direct-mail catalogs.Williams-Sonoma has exhibited an exceptional growth record, as it has grown its EPS every single year over the last nine years at an impressive 21.7% average annual rate. The exceptional growth rate combined with the consistency are testaments to the strength of the business model of Williams-Sonoma and its perfect execution.Williams-Sonoma is currently facing a strong headwind due to the surge of inflation to a 40-year high, which has led consumers to become more conservative in their spending habits. Excessive inflation has also increased the cost of raw materials, freight and labor.In addition, due to the aggressive interest rate hikes implemented by the Fed, the housing market has slowed down sharply. This is certainly a negative development for Williams-Sonoma. Nevertheless, thanks to its strong business execution, Williams-Sonoma is poised to report just a 4% decrease in EPS for 2022. Notably, EPS in 2022 will still more than triple that of 2019.Williams-Sonoma has grown its dividend for 16 consecutive years and is currently offering a 2.7% dividend yield. While the current yield is lackluster, the company has a payout ratio of only 22%. Moreover, the retailer has grown its dividend by 13% per year on average over the last decade and by 15% per year on average over the last five years. Given its rock-solid balance sheet, Williams-Sonoma can continue raising its dividend at a double-digit rate for many more years.H.B. Fuller (FUL)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockH.B. Fuller (NYSE:FUL) has a history of 135 years and is a leading global provider of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products. Just like Parker-Hannifin, it operates in a highly profitable niche market thanks to the obscure but essential nature of its products.The surge of inflation to a 40-year high exerts great pressure on most industrial manufacturers, as it has significantly increased the costs of raw materials, labor and freight. However, H.B. Fuller has proved markedly resilient to this headwind. Thanks to the critical nature of its products, the company has been able to implement material price hikes. Thus, it has passed its increased costs to its customers. As a result, H.B. Fuller is on track to report 21% EPS growth for 2022, a new all-time high.H.B. Fuller has grown its EPS by 6.9% per year on average over the last decade and by 7.5% per year on average over the last five years. The company proved resilient to the pandemic, with just a 4% EPS decrease in 2020. Even better, it grew EPS by 22% in 2021 and by about 21% in 2022. The only caveat is the somewhat volatile performance record of H.B. Fuller.On the other hand, H.B. Fuller has an exceptional dividend growth record. Indeed, the stock is a Dividend King, with 53 consecutive years of dividend growth. Despite this streak, the stock passes under the radar of most income-oriented investors due to its poor yield. It is currently offering a 1.1% dividend yield. It has offered a dividend yield of only 1%-1.5% throughout the last decade.However, investors should realize that the low yield results from the exceptionally low payout ratio of the stock, which currently stands at 18%. In other words, the company prefers to invest its cash in acquisitions to grow its earnings instead of offering higher dividends. H.B. Fuller has grown its dividend by 8% per year on average over the last decade and by 4.5% per year on average over the last five years. Given its low payout ratio and its healthy balance sheet, H.B. Fuller can continue raising its dividend meaningfully for many years.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.34% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.64%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 8.98%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the food distributor had lost 1.87% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 0.17% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1% in that time.Sysco will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Sysco to post earnings of $0.84 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 47.37%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.71 billion, up 14.66% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.16 per share and revenue of $76.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28% and +11.48%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Sysco should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Sysco is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Sysco is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 19.39. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.27.Story continuesMeanwhile, SYY's PEG ratio is currently 2.15. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Food - Miscellaneous industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.17 as of yesterday's close.The Food - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 56, which puts it in the top 23% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

81,ab4ad6dd-2e85-37f9-a8d3-ae4ac69c5cf9,SYY,2023-01-13,Institutional investors must be pleased after a 5.7% gain last week that adds to Sysco Corporation's (NYSE:SYY) one-year returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-must-pleased-5-140012692.html,1673532012,STORY,['SYY'],"[If you want to know who really controls Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 5.7% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 2.7% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sysco. See our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Sysco already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sysco's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sysco. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. The second and third largest shareholders are Wellington Management Group LLP and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Sysco Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$70m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Sysco .Ultimately the future is most important.

The airline had long cultivated a reputation for reliable customer service, humorous flight crews and low-cost flights.Southwest's board has set up a new Operations Review Committee to oversee management following last month's systems collapse, Jordan said.Asked about his job security, he said: ""I'm not focused on that one bit, and at the end of the day, that's not up to me in any case.""""There are a lot of reasons that this happened, but it's on me at the end of the day,"" Jordan said. ""It's on me to not let this happen again and to rebuild trust with our employees and rebuild trust with our customers, and we will do exactly that.""Jordan, who took the airline's helm last February, is under pressure from investors to win over customers. To mollify them, the carrier has awarded customers affected by the meltdown 25,000 Rapid Rewards points, equivalent to more than $300, as a goodwill gesture, and has also launched a fare sale.Jordan said New York-based Oliver Wyman is interviewing company staff and union members to reconstruct the recent debacle in order to identify gaps in the carrier's operations.Meanwhile, the company has put in interim measures to avoid a repeat, he said. General Electric Co is updating the company's software, which will automate its crew scheduling systems, he said.Story continuesGE said the current software Southwest uses ""performed as designed"" during the problems last month. ""We are working with them to define new functionality as they improve their crew rescheduling capability,” it said in a statement.Southwest has also put together a new team of trained employees who can be cross-utilized to manage rescheduling crew during a disruption that requires significant schedule changes. Jordan said the company activated this group during the Federal Aviation Administration nationwide ground stop on Wednesday.The airline is processing tens of thousands of customer reimbursements a day, he added. With the exception of 1% of bags, the airline has delivered to customer all the luggage that went missing.Jordan defended the airline's point-to-point business model, which allows customers to fly directly from smaller cities without having to stop and change planes at major hubs like Chicago and New York. He said last month's disruption was not due to the structure, but said the airline could set up more crew bases if Oliver Wyman recommends that.

PM appears smoking hot due to its robust pricing power and gains from reduced risk products or RRPs. These upsides have been working well for the tobacco giant amid cost-related headwinds and low cigarette volumes.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 17% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings per share (EPS) has risen by 2 cents to $5.80 in the past 60 days.Let’s delve deeper into the aspects that are likely to keep Phillip Morris’ growth record going.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuotePricing – a Key DriverPM has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income, even in the face of the unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance across most regions in the third quarter of 2022. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines improved year over year and beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted EPS came in at $1.53, which increased 8.2% year over year on a currency-neutral basis. The year-over-year upside was backed by solid net revenues, elevated pricing and operating cost efficiencies amid certain margin pressures.Net revenues of $8,032 million increased by 6.7% on an organic basis. Proforma adjusted net revenues grew 6.9% on an organic basis. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,225 million. Proforma adjusted net revenue growth was backed by the total shipment volume increase, a continued mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products and improved pricing variance.Story continuesFocus on RRPsSerious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk RRPs. Philip Morris is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating more than 30% of the company’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2022.The company is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.In the third quarter of 2022, revenues from RRPs jumped 12.9% to $2,362 million. In the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance. IQOS ILUMA continued to generate solid results across launch markets. Management expects solid prospects from IQOS in the future. As of Sep 30, 2022, PM is estimated to have roughly 19.5 million IQOS users on a proforma basis, suggesting growth of 22% year over year.Wrapping UpPhilip Morris looks well-placed to add new leaves to its growth story. For 2022, the company expects proforma adjusted net revenues to increase by nearly 6.5-8% on an organic basis (compared with 6-8% before). Proforma adjusted EPS, excluding currency impacts, is expected to increase 10-12% to the $6.09-$6.20 range in 2022.Other Consumer Staple Stocks to GrabSome other top-ranked stocks are Nomad Foods NOMD, Campbell Soup CPB and Ingredion Incorporated INGR.Nomad Foods, a frozen food product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The pilot program has started with limited capacity and the company is expected to expand operations in the future.WU stopped remittance services to Cuba in 2020, following government sanctions, some of which have been eased by the current administration. The pilot phase is rolled out in three locations in Miami. Money can be sent to three Cuban state-run banks in this phase. Payments restrictions currently include a $2,000-per-day limit, only dollar transfers are allowed and online mode is unavailable.Tight U.S. sanctions hit Cuba’s economy hard. As such, the latest move from Western Union is expected to be beneficial for its economy, which is still recovering from the pandemic and finding it hard to rely on its struggling tourism industry. The resumption of services will also likely reduce dependency on informal money-changing services.Western Union is a significant stakeholder in the global remittance market, with operations in more than 200 countries and territories. Strengthening its remittance-led offerings is in line with the company’s long-term growth plan.The global remittance market was affected by the pandemic-driven uncertainties and roadblocks.

These assets are currently gaining widespread popularity as long-term investment options, with many investors now looking for must-buy REITs.With REITs varying in terms of their holdings (different asset classes and risk levels), there is a REIT for every type of investor. When researching this sector, it’s important that investors consider each investment’s risk level, expected rate of return, management team, and other applicable metrics. When done correctly, REITs can provide short- and long-term growth potential.REITs provide investors with a way to invest in real estate without purchasing physical property. They are also an excellent option for investors who want to diversify their portfolios and benefit from the high return potential over the long-run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsReliable dividend payments are becoming much more attractive in today’s economy. Inflation is at its highest levels in four decades, and there is plenty of economic uncertainty. This article will discuss some of the must-buy REITs that look attractive in this current environment. All offer excellent yields and are trading at attractive multiples due to the ongoing bear market. But remember, before diving in, make sure the REIT in question supports your investment profile.With that said, here are five top must-buy REITs for those dissecting this space.SPRSimon Property Group$118.87DLRDigital Realty Trust$101.38PEAKHealthpeak Properties$26.74ESSEssex Properties Trust$214.70VTRVentas$47.82Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDividend yield: 6.11%Investing in real estate can be very lucrative, and Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) is a prime example. It’s first on this list of must-buy REITs for a reason. As a manager of one of the best portfolios in the United States, Simon specializes in regional malls, outlet centers, and community/lifestyle centers.Story continuesMall shopping provides an enjoyable pass time for locals, increasingly drawing international tourists. These properties can offer something that online shopping or other retailers simply cannot – an experience far beyond purchasing goods. Because these assets are unique and provide satisfying experiences, investing in a REIT like Simon Property is often very rewarding.Despite having an attractive portfolio, Simon Property Group is down approximately 28% over the past year. Broader macroeconomic trends are to blame here. The pandemic affected the shopping industry more than others, so investors have been reluctant to return to this space. Plus, inflation and other factors are also having an impact.On its own, Simon Property Group is doing very well. The REIT reported strong Q3 earnings and revenue growth due to increasing occupancy and rents. The firm decided to increase its full-year guidance and dividend in light of its impressive performance.Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Image of computer servers lined up in a dark roomSource: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.comDividend yield: 5.02%Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is an invaluable REIT that continues to provide quality services despite economic challenges. The company’s third-quarter performance was quite impressive in light of the difficulties surrounding the economy. Thanks to Digital Realty’s value-add business model and strong operational strengths, it remained buoyant. This allowed the trust to meet its client needs with efficiency and reliability. Investors can be sure that Digital Realty Trust is dedicated to offering the best portfolio of data centers, co-location, and interconnected solutions to ensure a secure digital infrastructure for businesses worldwide.Recently, Digital Realty has earned the distinction of being a multinational powerhouse, consistently surpassing its already-high expectations. Displaying a revenue growth that greatly exceeded those predictions, its third-quarter performance stunned the industry by achieving a record-high $176 million in annualized bookings.Although impressive, this accomplishment also reveals the trust’s ability to evolve sustainably from a simple provider of data center space to one that can successfully provide for space, power, and connection needs. This capacity for adaptation demonstrates why investors have every reason to remain deeply impressed with Digital Realty’s potential, as this only illustrates the potential growth of this particular REIT.Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockDividend yield: 4.58%Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) is a U.S. healthcare REIT that has been performing extraordinarily well over the past year, evidenced by its third-quarter same-store cash NOI growth of 5.1%. This exceeded expectations and proved the company’s ability to adjust its strategy to succeed in difficult times. Healthpeak has made wise strategic decisions, divesting most of their senior housing assets, raising roughly $4 billion, and focusing their remaining portfolio on Healthpeak’s lucrative life science and medical office assets. These prudent decisions has solidified this REIT as one of the top healthcare options to watch in 2023.This past quarter’s strong results were largely driven by strong tenant retention levels and same-store net operating income growth. These metrics are important for long-term investors to consider. Indeed, I think these past results could be indicative of future performance. Healthpeak Properties has proven it has what it takes to bounce back from adversity and generate impressive shareholder returns. If you are looking for REITs to buy in the healthcare space, look no further.Essex Property Trust (ESS)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockDividend yield: 4.23%Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) has become a prominent player in the California and Pacific Northwest real estate markets. The REIT’s varied portfolio includes apartments, condominiums, townhomes, and other multifamily dwellings in some of these regions’ most desirable real estate markets.Owning these properties entitles investors to certain benefits, such as long-term leases and steady occupancy levels from tenants. With consistent investment returns generated by each property, this powerhouse REIT sets a high bar for all who follow in their footsteps.Essex is taking advantage of the booming markets in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle to expand their business. This presents an incredible opportunity for their development and growth. Home to millions of Americans, these bustling cities are experiencing increased income growth and favorable single-family housing costs, further accentuating the potential for same-store sales growth. These conditions create an optimistic outlook for attracting new customers while increasing current value. These exciting prospects could potentially lead Essex to success in its current markets.Ventas (VTR)A nurse is helping a older woman. Elder care. Senior care.Source: Rido / ShutterstockDividend yield: 3.84%Last on this list of must-buy REITs is Ventas (NYSE:VTR), an established player specializing in healthcare facilities and senior living communities. From medical office buildings to senior housing and hospitals, this REIT manages various properties that serve a range of healthcare needs. It owns approximately 1,200 properties across the U.S., U.K., and Canada. Their expertise has set them apart from many competitors, resulting in Ventas’ steady growth as a leading provider of healthcare services in North America and around the world.Ventas’ senior housing portfolio performed incredibly well in the third quarter, with an impressive 8.7% same-store revenue growth reported.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.07 billion, down 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries?For PPG Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that PPG Industries will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.66, delivering a surprise of -0.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PPG Industries appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$5.11bUS$5.28bUS$6.28bUS$6.97bUS$7.48bUS$7.91bUS$8.28bUS$8.60bUS$8.88bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.36%Est @ 5.75%Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$3.8kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (11%– 2.0%) = US$97bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$97b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$71b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$58.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.547. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SchlumbergerStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +11.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has gained 18.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.15 points to a change of +68% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.03 indicates a change of +40.6% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.8%. The $28.04 billion and $32.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +16.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.36 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.67%. The EPS surprise was +14.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $60.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Aptiv shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Aptiv is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Technology Services industry that ranks in the Top 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.29 per share to $1.21 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Aptiv right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

110,c506397e-8dab-3021-b102-9b5b889f8f68,NTRS,2023-01-13,Analysts Estimate Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-northern-trust-corporation-150003997.html,1673535603,STORY,"['NTRS', 'PNC']","[The market expects Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust Corporation?For Northern Trust Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northern Trust Corporation would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of -1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northern Trust Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.95 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.69 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Walt Disney DIS, Netflix NFLX and Paramount Global PARA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:International Game Technology is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that operates and provides gaming technology products and services. The company is engaged in design, development, manufacture and marketing of casino-style gaming equipment, systems technology, and game content.Like many stocks in 2022, IGT struggled for most of the year. However, the bulls came back into the name in the fourth quarter. The stock rallied about 50% off its September lows and closed down 20% on the year.So far in 2023, the buyers have showed their presence, taking the stock higher by 7% to start the year.Reason for the bullishness over the last few months was a strong earnings report back in November. If the company can continue its earnings trend, there is reason to believe the stock can continue higher and be a big winner in 2023.More about IGTThe company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in London, England. It employs over 10,000 people and has a market cap of $5 billion.IGT operates in three segments: Global Lottery, Global Gaming, and Digital &amp; Betting.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Value, but “D” in Momentum. The Forward PE is 16 and the stock pays a 3.3% dividend.Q3 EarningsIn November of last year, the company reported a massive 441% earnings beat. This was the third straight EPS beat and the largest upside surprise since May of 2021.Q3 came in at $0.43 v the $0.25 expected. Revenue also beat, coming in at $1.06B v the $1.01B expected. Q4 revenues were guided at $1.0B v the 1.01B expected and IGT affirmed FY22 revenues at $4.1-4.2B v the $4.09B expected.Story continuesOperating margins for Q4 are expected to come in at 18-19% for Q4 and 20-22% for FY22.Management expects net debt leverage to improve 3.1x, which is the lowest in company history. Moreover, they say that customer and player demand trends remain encouraging.After the earnings release, investors cheered the stock higher. IGT jumped 20% higher, going from just over $20 to $24.50Estimates RisingEstimates have been trending higher since that earnings report. Over the last 90 days, analyst have taken their numbers higher for all time frames.For the current quarter, we see estimates jumping 23%, from $0.21 to $0.26. For the current year, estimates have been taken 134% higher, from $0.82 to $1.92.Looking to the long-term, the trend continues. For next year, estimates have gone from $1.27 to $1.49, or 17%.The stock saw a price upgrade right after the report as Susquehanna took its targets from $22 to $25. More recently, Société Générale reiterated its Hold rating, but took its price target higher from $22.60 to $24.90.The Technical TakeThe stock has been all over the place over the last two years, but is currently trading in the middle of its trading range during that period. The question for investors is if this stock will see sideways trading or if the price will get back to the 2021 highs near $33.The good news is that the recent earnings strength has taken the stock over all its major moving averages. For those looking for dips to MA support levels, the 200-day is at $20.75 and the 50-day is at $23.40.It might take a while for the stock to break out of its base after gapping higher. In the meantime, investors should feel good being long the stock if it stays above $20.In SummaryInternational Game Technology has started the year off right. Investors are clearly excited for what this stock might bring in 2023. While IGT might experience some sideways trading, the company pays a nice dividend while the story plays out.If earnings momentum can continue over the next couple quarters, look for the stock to take out 2022 highs and be one of the top performing names in 2023.Bear of the Day:Jack In The Box is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates and franchises Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants. With over 2,200 restaurants, the company is one of the largest hamburger chains in the country.After disappointing earnings, the stock traded below October lows towards the $65 level. More recently, JACK has rallied with the overall market, up 17% from December lows.Investors might be getting ahead of themselves as the upcoming quarter is likely threatened by inflationary impacts on margins.About the CompanyJACK is headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company was founded in 1951 and employs 22,000 people.JACK is valued at $1.6 billion and has a Forward PE of 14. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Value and “A” in Momentum. The company pays a dividend of 2.3%.Q4 EarningsThe company reported EPS on November 22nd, missing expectations by 1.4%. JACK reported Q4 at $1.33 v the $1.35 and revenues came in slightly better than expected. Jack In the Box saw year over year Same Store Sales growth of 4%, while Del Taco saw growth of 5.2%.The company guided FY23 operating EPS of $5.25-5.62. The guidance was disappointing to investors and the stock was sold aggressively after the earnings report.EstimatesBecause of the light guidance, analysts are lowering estimates and dropping price targets.Over the last 60 days, analyst estimates have been lowered across all time frames. For the current quarter, estimates have dropped from $2.02 to $1.72, or 14%. For the current year, they have fallen 17%, down to $5.48 from $6.60.After earnings a handful of analysts took their price targets lower. UBS went from $85 to $77, Wedbush to $100 from $115 and Barclays went to $73 from $88.Technical TakeAfter the rally in the stock over the last few weeks, JACK is finding resistance at the 200-day moving average. If the bulls fail to hold this area, the stock will likely drop back to the December trading range.Earnings are due up in late February and investors should be cautious of more trouble with margins. We likely get sideway trading until then and after earnings the chart will tell us which direction the stock may go.For now, over $80 looks bullish, but under $70 the bears are back in control.SummaryLike many restaurants, the higher costs of food and labor is starting to eat into margins. For now, the fundamental story makes the stock an avoid. While the chart looks much better, the stock is at resistance, so investors should take caution at current levels.Additional content:Disney Wins Big at Golden Globes, Outperforms NetflixThe Walt Disney won nine awards at this year’s Golden Globe, including the category of Best Picture, Musical or Comedy with The Banshees of Inisherin. The movie had to compete against the likes of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery from Netflix and Babylon from Paramount Pictures, a subsidiary of Paramount Global.Colin Farrell won the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical/Comedy) for The Banshees of Inisherin, with Martin McDonagh winning the Best Screenplay award.Abbott Elementaryfrom Disney’s ABC/20th Television won the Best Television Series (Musical/Comedy) award.Quinta Brunson won the Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series (Musical/Comedy), while Tyler James Williams was selected for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical-Comedy or Drama Television Series.Other notable winners were Jeremy Allen White — Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series (Musical/Comedy), Angela Bassett — Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture, and Amanda Seyfried — Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television.The Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteHowever, Disney’s Avatar: The Way of Water failed to win in the Best Picture, Drama category, in which Universal Pictures emerged victorious with The Fabelmans. Steven Spielberg won the Best Director, Motion Picture award for the movie.Netflix had a relatively quiet Golden Globe this year, winning three awards. Guillermo del Toro became the first Latino to win the best animated feature Golden Globe for Pinocchio. The other two wins include Julia Garner for Ozark (Best Supporting Actress, Television) and Evan Peters for  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (Best Performance by an Actor, Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture made for Television).Disney’s Strong Content Portfolio Boosts ProspectsDisney, along with media companies like Comcast and Paramount, is suffering from the lingering effects of COVID-19 and intensifying competition in the saturated streaming space still dominated by Netflix.The latest Golden Globe wins reflect Disney’s strong content portfolio. Although Avatar: The Way of Water didn’t win any awards, it was one of the highest-grossing movies released in 2022. As these latest movies will be eventually released into Disney’s streaming service, Disney+, subscriber base growth is expected to remain strong. Disney+ added more than 12 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.However, Disney’s direct-to-consumer division reported an operating loss of $1.5 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, which doubled year over year. This has been attributed to macroeconomic factors like inflation, which have spiked up the cost of production for the company, as well as adverse foreign exchange impact that decreased Disney+’s ARPU by 5%.Nevertheless, Disney is focusing on the realignment of costs, including rationalization of marketing spending, and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement.

And this is due to some of those more longer term catalysts, like the platform's recently debuted ad tier, along with its crackdown on password sharing. Jefferies estimated that revenue and adjusted EBITDA will come in well above Wall Street estimates in 2024. And that's going to result in some positive margin upside and valuation expanding back towards historic averages.So if you're a Netflix investor, this is something that is going to take some time. You're not going to see immediate changes this year, but perhaps in 2024, we'll be able to see some of the benefits of what Netflix is doing right now. Wait and see.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the IRA's drug pricing provisions will reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over the next decade.Medicare will select the first 10 drugs for the program this year. The number of medications subject to price negotiation will increase over time, but newer drugs are not included.The law sets a nine-year exemption period for ""small-molecule"" drugs, which are mainly pills, while ""large molecule"" biologics, generally injections or infusions, are protected from negotiation for 13 years.""The difference between a nine- and 13-year product line is about 50 or 60% of the value,"" Eli Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks said in an interview. ""In 10 years, we'll have far fewer small molecules being developed than we do today.""He questioned the benefit of ""rules that really just disincentivize investment in what ends up being convenient drugs, drugs for tough conditions like cancer and drugs that get really cheap when they go generic.""Story continuesLilly has already dropped a small-molecule blood cancer drug from its pipeline because ""we just couldn't make the math work,"" Ricks said.The Indianapolis-based company is considering culling more early-stage pill programs and is directing its small molecule development group to only pursue opportunities ""that would be clearly good enough within nine years to be winners.""U.S. Congresswoman Katie Porter, a Democrat who has pressed for drug price limits, described the companies' strategy for dealing with the law as ""treating potential new drugs as bargaining chips instead of as cures to save lives.""Most medicines on the market today are small molecules, which can be taken by mouth, absorbed into the bloodstream and easily penetrate cell membranes. Common examples include aspirin, statins for high cholesterol and blood pressure drugs.In recent decades, pharmaceutical development has moved into more complex, difficult to manufacture large molecules, derived from living cells that can target a specific location or mechanism in the body. These biologics, like AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, need to be injected or infused and can require special handling or monitoring of patients.But the industry has also come up with innovative pills, which patients often prefer. Lilly and other drugmakers, for instance, are developing oral drugs for a diabetes and obesity- related target that is currently reached only by injected drugs.'UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES'When pills lose patent protection, generic copies usually enter the market at price discounts of up to 90%, while the competing ""biosimilar"" versions of large molecule drugs is much less robust and the discounts much lower.Steven Pearson, president of the influential drug pricing research group Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, said the IRA overall should help lower prices for Medicare patients but acknowledged new laws like it can have ""unintended consequences.""He noted it is not unusual for pharmaceutical companies to choose not to pursue a drug they once thought promising.""We have only made it more complicated now,"" he said.Stephen Ubl, president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), said the industry trade group believes the IRA should not set different exemption periods based on drug type. ""We would like that provision to be fixed,"" he said.Executives at U.S. biotech Amgen Inc said the IRA will have broad industry impact, but that Amgen is well-positioned for growth due to its strong position in biologics.""Large molecules are relatively favored under the IRA as opposed to small molecules,"" David Reese, head of Amgen research and development, said in an interview. ""Given our history and our focus in protein therapeutics, that's one advantage.""PhRMA said that when asked in a recent survey if they expect to shift research and development investment away from small molecule medicines, 63% of member companies who responded to the question said yes.

The drop was the worst since February 2020.Reflecting faltering world demand, outbound shipments to the United States shrank 19.5% in December, while those to the EU fell 17.5%, according to Reuters' calculations based on the official data.Despite the sharp falloff in shipments in the last few months, China's total exports rose 7% in 2022 thanks to its strong trade with Southeast Asian nations as well as an export boom of new energy vehicles. Still, growth was a far cry from a 29.6% gain in 2021.Imports fell 7.5% last month, moderating from a 10.6% decline in November and better than a forecast 9.8% decline.China's 2022 trade surplus hit an all-time peak of $877.6 billion, the highest since records started in 1950, compared with $670.4 billion in 2021.Story continuesDOMESTIC DEMAND KEY TO 2023 RECOVERYBoosting domestic consumption will be vital to Beijing's economic recovery plans, and there is lots of lost ground to recover -- imports rose only 1.1% last year, down sharply from 30% growth in 2021.China's purchases of coal and copper shrank in December, as industrial activity slowed on a surge in COVID-19 infections.Policymakers have pledged to increase support for the economy as they are eager to underpin growth and ease disruptions caused by the sudden end to COVID-19 curbs.Measures to ease a crippling funding crunch in the property sector, in particular, could revive home sales and boost imports of industrial materials from iron ore to copper.Lloyd Chan, senior economist at Oxford Economics, expects more support for property developers and households, but said net trade is still likely to be a drag on China's growth this year.""Any near-term lift is unlikely given weak domestic sentiment and the ongoing COVID surge.""WEAK GLOBAL DEMAND COULD TEMPER ECONOMIC RECOVERYChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday that slowing external demand and the rising risks of a global recession are posing the biggest pressures to the country's trade stabilisation, leaving ""arduous tasks.""An official factory activity survey showed a sub-index of new export orders has remained in contraction territory for 20 consecutive months.But the ministry said major exporting provinces have reported seeing some improvement in getting new orders. After three years, Chinese authorities have finally removed anti-virus curbs that disrupted port logistics and shut down factories in key manufacturing hubs.REBOUNDAnalysts polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth to rebound to 4.9% in 2023, before steadying in 2024, a Reuters poll showed.The economy likely grew just 2.8% in 2022 amid widespread lockdowns, well below the official target of around 5.5%. Fourth quarter and 2022 gross domestic product data (GDP) data will be released on Jan. 17.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday she expected China to become a net contributor to the global economy by mid-2023, and urged Beijing to stay the course in reversing its earlier zero-COVID policy.Analysts at the Bank of America expect China's consumption to have a ""faster and sharper"" rebound than that seen in the rest of Asia.But some manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook.Jin Chaofeng, whose company in the east coast city of Hangzhou exports outdoor rattan furniture, said he has no market expansion or hiring plans for 2023.""With the lifting of COVID curbs, domestic demand is expected to improve but not for exports...,"" he said.""With no signs of the ending of the Russia-Ukraine war or crucial improvement in China-U.S. relations, this year's exports may be worse than 2022,"" Jin said, adding his company has been reducing inventories over recent months.(Reporting by Ellen Zhang and Joe Cash; Additional reporting by Shen Yan, Liangping Gao and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Bernard Orr and Kim Coghill)]"

The number-crunchers in Wall Street and London, incentivized not only to be right but to be right first, are already looking at the next big trend.The Paris-based OECD and the International Monetary Fund both warned of the risk of a global recession at the end of last year, and the World Bank’s latest issue of its Global Economic Prospects is just as gloomy, saying that global growth will slow to 1.7% this year. Only in two of the last 30 years – in 2009 and 2020 – has it been slower. Last year's monetary policy tightening means this year's credit crunch, especially for developing countries: the World Bank estimates that 1 in 5 is now effectively shut out of global debt markets, up from 1 in 15 before the pandemic.But global markets are behaving as if all that is old hat. The release on Thursday of figures showing that the U.S. inflation rate fell for a sixth straight month has emboldened hopes that not only will the Federal Reserve stop raising interest rates soon, it may even cut them before the end of the year as fears about the economy replace fears about inflation.In China, meanwhile, the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday will see animal spirits unleashed on a massive scale, as 20% of the world’s population takes advantage of the freedom to travel on its biggest holiday for the first time in three years. The surge of outbound tourism is likely to provide real support to currencies in southeast Asia and further afield: Thailand’s baht has already risen 5% this year in anticipation.Story continuesOil import quotas issued to the country’s refiners for 2023 are reported by Reuters to be up by some 20% or more from a year ago – news of which pushed crude prices up by nearly $5 a barrel over the last week despite signs of an alarming slowdown in demand in the U.S.China’s abandonment of its Covid-Zero policy – which is admittedly likely to be stiffly tested by a wave of infections after the Lunar New Year - has changed calculations across the commodity markets. Iron ore is up 50% from its December lows, while copper – habitually the best proxy for global growth - is up 11% on the week, Aluminum is at a 7-month high and wheat, and Soybeans are both up by between 5% and 10% from their recent lows.In the U.S., the December CPI and Labor Market Report have bolstered fading hopes that the Fed may yet achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Comments from central bank officials suggesting that rates need to rise to 5% or more and then stay there are increasingly being interpreted as merely efforts to stop the market getting ahead of itself by pricing in rate cuts too early.The European Central Bank, like the Fed, refuses to countenance any let up in the fight against inflation until it can properly declare victory. However, its task is being made easier every day by the energy markets, where the massive spike that threatened to ruin most of European industry last year in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are now unwinding. Benchmark Dutch Gas Futures fell to their lowest since the invasion earlier this week, and even if they are still three time the prices that prevailed before the war started, they spent much of last summer at 10 times prewar levels. The improvement is not to be sniffed at.But at least two big tests lie ahead: first markets will need to be convinced that the rise in commodity prices – especially oil – doesn’t start a new wave of inflation itself, which could force markets to take hawkish Fed talk more seriously.Second, COVID could yet make a comeback in China if new variants thrive in a country of rebounding mobility and semi-effective vaccines, sending its consumer sector back into a funk and causing widespread and extended problems in the manufacturing and logistics sectors.It’s unlikely to be all plain sailing from here, but as long as the development banks are still gloomy, the downside in 2023 should be limited.Related ArticlesWeekly Comic: Winter has come - can spring be far behind?Japan yields break central bank ceiling as markets press for policy shiftIMF chief expects to keep 2023 global growth forecast steady at about 2.7%]"

Protesters have called for his release, her resignation and quick elections.Antapaccay called on authorities to ""focus on dialogue to find viable solutions to what the country is going through.""Later on Thursday, miner Minsur said it was temporarily suspending operations at its San Rafael mine, one of the largest tin mines in the world.Minsur said the decision to close its Puno mine was made ""in solidarity"" with the victims of the protest clashes, with 17 civilians killed in the same region earlier this week.

Both instruments were set to rise nearly 2% this week.The dollar sank to a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on Friday after data showed U.S. consumer price index inflation fell to its slowest pace in a year during December. The trend of softening inflation is likely to invite an eventual shift in the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric.Growing expectations of this shift have spurred a sharp rally in gold since late-December, given that it heralds some relief for the yellow metal after it was battered by a sharp rise in interest rates throughout 2022.Markets are now pricing in a nearly 95% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points in its February meeting, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose slightly on Friday, but were set for a stellar week of gains after China recently reopened its international borders following three years of lockdowns.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $4.1755 a pound- their highest level in seven months. They were also set to gain nearly 7% this week.Economic growth in China is expected to eventually recover this year, driving renewed strength in global copper demand as the country ramps up infrastructure spending.

According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $156.89, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Wynn Resorts’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Wynn Resorts generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. In the upcoming year, Wynn Resorts' earnings are expected to increase by 71%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since WYNN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WYNN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy WYNN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Wynn Resorts, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The drop was the worst since February 2020.Reflecting faltering world demand, outbound shipments to the United States shrank 19.5% in December, while those to the EU fell 17.5%, according to Reuters' calculations based on the official data.Despite the sharp falloff in shipments in the last few months, China's total exports rose 7% in 2022 thanks to its strong trade with Southeast Asian nations as well as an export boom of new energy vehicles. Still, growth was a far cry from a 29.6% gain in 2021.Imports fell 7.5% last month, moderating from a 10.6% decline in November and better than a forecast 9.8% decline.China's 2022 trade surplus hit an all-time peak of $877.6 billion, the highest since records started in 1950, compared with $670.4 billion in 2021.Story continuesDOMESTIC DEMAND KEY TO 2023 RECOVERYBoosting domestic consumption will be vital to Beijing's economic recovery plans, and there is lots of lost ground to recover -- imports rose only 1.1% last year, down sharply from 30% growth in 2021.China's purchases of coal and copper shrank in December, as industrial activity slowed on a surge in COVID-19 infections.Policymakers have pledged to increase support for the economy as they are eager to underpin growth and ease disruptions caused by the sudden end to COVID-19 curbs.Measures to ease a crippling funding crunch in the property sector, in particular, could revive home sales and boost imports of industrial materials from iron ore to copper.Lloyd Chan, senior economist at Oxford Economics, expects more support for property developers and households, but said net trade is still likely to be a drag on China's growth this year.""Any near-term lift is unlikely given weak domestic sentiment and the ongoing COVID surge.""WEAK GLOBAL DEMAND COULD TEMPER ECONOMIC RECOVERYChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday that slowing external demand and the rising risks of a global recession are posing the biggest pressures to the country's trade stabilisation, leaving ""arduous tasks.""An official factory activity survey showed a sub-index of new export orders has remained in contraction territory for 20 consecutive months.But the ministry said major exporting provinces have reported seeing some improvement in getting new orders. After three years, Chinese authorities have finally removed anti-virus curbs that disrupted port logistics and shut down factories in key manufacturing hubs.REBOUNDAnalysts polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth to rebound to 4.9% in 2023, before steadying in 2024, a Reuters poll showed.The economy likely grew just 2.8% in 2022 amid widespread lockdowns, well below the official target of around 5.5%. Fourth quarter and 2022 gross domestic product data (GDP) data will be released on Jan. 17.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday she expected China to become a net contributor to the global economy by mid-2023, and urged Beijing to stay the course in reversing its earlier zero-COVID policy.Analysts at the Bank of America expect China's consumption to have a ""faster and sharper"" rebound than that seen in the rest of Asia.But some manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook.Jin Chaofeng, whose company in the east coast city of Hangzhou exports outdoor rattan furniture, said he has no market expansion or hiring plans for 2023.""With the lifting of COVID curbs, domestic demand is expected to improve but not for exports...,"" he said.""With no signs of the ending of the Russia-Ukraine war or crucial improvement in China-U.S. relations, this year's exports may be worse than 2022,"" Jin said, adding his company has been reducing inventories over recent months.(Reporting by Ellen Zhang and Joe Cash; Additional reporting by Shen Yan, Liangping Gao and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Bernard Orr and Kim Coghill)]"

The number-crunchers in Wall Street and London, incentivized not only to be right but to be right first, are already looking at the next big trend.The Paris-based OECD and the International Monetary Fund both warned of the risk of a global recession at the end of last year, and the World Bank’s latest issue of its Global Economic Prospects is just as gloomy, saying that global growth will slow to 1.7% this year. Only in two of the last 30 years – in 2009 and 2020 – has it been slower. Last year's monetary policy tightening means this year's credit crunch, especially for developing countries: the World Bank estimates that 1 in 5 is now effectively shut out of global debt markets, up from 1 in 15 before the pandemic.But global markets are behaving as if all that is old hat. The release on Thursday of figures showing that the U.S. inflation rate fell for a sixth straight month has emboldened hopes that not only will the Federal Reserve stop raising interest rates soon, it may even cut them before the end of the year as fears about the economy replace fears about inflation.In China, meanwhile, the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday will see animal spirits unleashed on a massive scale, as 20% of the world’s population takes advantage of the freedom to travel on its biggest holiday for the first time in three years. The surge of outbound tourism is likely to provide real support to currencies in southeast Asia and further afield: Thailand’s baht has already risen 5% this year in anticipation.Story continuesOil import quotas issued to the country’s refiners for 2023 are reported by Reuters to be up by some 20% or more from a year ago – news of which pushed crude prices up by nearly $5 a barrel over the last week despite signs of an alarming slowdown in demand in the U.S.China’s abandonment of its Covid-Zero policy – which is admittedly likely to be stiffly tested by a wave of infections after the Lunar New Year - has changed calculations across the commodity markets. Iron ore is up 50% from its December lows, while copper – habitually the best proxy for global growth - is up 11% on the week, Aluminum is at a 7-month high and wheat, and Soybeans are both up by between 5% and 10% from their recent lows.In the U.S., the December CPI and Labor Market Report have bolstered fading hopes that the Fed may yet achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Comments from central bank officials suggesting that rates need to rise to 5% or more and then stay there are increasingly being interpreted as merely efforts to stop the market getting ahead of itself by pricing in rate cuts too early.The European Central Bank, like the Fed, refuses to countenance any let up in the fight against inflation until it can properly declare victory. However, its task is being made easier every day by the energy markets, where the massive spike that threatened to ruin most of European industry last year in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are now unwinding. Benchmark Dutch Gas Futures fell to their lowest since the invasion earlier this week, and even if they are still three time the prices that prevailed before the war started, they spent much of last summer at 10 times prewar levels. The improvement is not to be sniffed at.But at least two big tests lie ahead: first markets will need to be convinced that the rise in commodity prices – especially oil – doesn’t start a new wave of inflation itself, which could force markets to take hawkish Fed talk more seriously.Second, COVID could yet make a comeback in China if new variants thrive in a country of rebounding mobility and semi-effective vaccines, sending its consumer sector back into a funk and causing widespread and extended problems in the manufacturing and logistics sectors.It’s unlikely to be all plain sailing from here, but as long as the development banks are still gloomy, the downside in 2023 should be limited.Related ArticlesWeekly Comic: Winter has come - can spring be far behind?Japan yields break central bank ceiling as markets press for policy shiftIMF chief expects to keep 2023 global growth forecast steady at about 2.7%]"

Protesters have called for his release, her resignation and quick elections.Antapaccay called on authorities to ""focus on dialogue to find viable solutions to what the country is going through.""Later on Thursday, miner Minsur said it was temporarily suspending operations at its San Rafael mine, one of the largest tin mines in the world.Minsur said the decision to close its Puno mine was made ""in solidarity"" with the victims of the protest clashes, with 17 civilians killed in the same region earlier this week.

Both instruments were set to rise nearly 2% this week.The dollar sank to a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on Friday after data showed U.S. consumer price index inflation fell to its slowest pace in a year during December. The trend of softening inflation is likely to invite an eventual shift in the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric.Growing expectations of this shift have spurred a sharp rally in gold since late-December, given that it heralds some relief for the yellow metal after it was battered by a sharp rise in interest rates throughout 2022.Markets are now pricing in a nearly 95% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points in its February meeting, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose slightly on Friday, but were set for a stellar week of gains after China recently reopened its international borders following three years of lockdowns.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $4.1755 a pound- their highest level in seven months. They were also set to gain nearly 7% this week.Economic growth in China is expected to eventually recover this year, driving renewed strength in global copper demand as the country ramps up infrastructure spending. But the near-term outlook still remains uncertain, given that China is struggling with its worst ever COVID-19 outbreak.Story continuesPotential disruptions in supply, caused by political violence in world no. 2 copper producer Peru, is also expected to benefit copper prices in the near-term.Related ArticlesGold set for 4th straight week of gains after positive CPI dataOil heads for solid weekly gain on China demand hopesOil treads water but set for strong weekly gains as inflation fears ease]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.34%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.64%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 8.98%.Heading into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 4.57% over the past month, lagging the Aerospace sector's gain of 1.54% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1% in that time.Lockheed Martin will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 24, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Lockheed Martin to post earnings of $7.40 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.21%.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has gained 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $7.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.68 points to a change of -4.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.37 indicates a change of +26.3% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $18.25 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $65.24 billion and $65.77 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.7% and +0.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $16.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $6.87 for the same period compares with $6.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.43%. The EPS surprise was +4.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when then-Senator Richard Burr sold a bunch of stocks at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it caught the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Court filings suggest that the former North Carolina Senator sold $1.65 million worth of stocks on February 13, 2020, right before the pandemic-induced market tumble. The SEC was investigating whether Burr sold stocks “on the basis of material nonpublic information.”Luckily for Burr, the SEC ended its probe this month without taking action.“This week, the SEC informed me that they have concluded their investigation with no action,” Burr said in a statement. “I am glad to have this matter in the rearview mirror as I begin my retirement from the Senate following nearly three decades of public service.”Whether politicians should be allowed to trade stocks has always been a contentious subject.

Not a single question was asked to Peltz, the source added.""Nelson is gearing up for a fight here,"" the source said, noting Peltz may press Disney to cut expenses among other initiatives designed to boost profits and the sagging stock price.Peltz — who has run successful activist campaigns at well-known brands like P&amp;G — would also like to see the dividend Disney cut during the pandemic restored, the source said. Peltz hasn't decided if a Disney spin-off of ESPN — as Wall Street has pushed for in the past — should occur, the source added.Peltz reportedly owns about $900 million in Disney stock, and also took to criticizing Iger's compensation in a lengthy new slide-deck called ""Restore the Magic.""Iger was not made available to Yahoo Finance for an interview.Nelson Peltz founding partner of Trian Fund Management LP. speak at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Mike BlakeTo be sure, this is shaping up to be one of the uglier activist battles in recent memories — filled with big egos, big money, and a big brand.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Disney announced Nike executive chairman and former CEO Mark Parker will take over Susan Arnold's position as chairman of the board. The company also recommended shareholders vote against Peltz in his efforts to win a seat on the company's board.""While senior leadership of The Walt Disney Company and its Board of Directors have engaged with Mr. Peltz numerous times over the last few months, the Board does not endorse the Trian Group nominee, and recommends that shareholders not support its nominee, and instead vote FOR all the Company’s nominees (noted above),"" Disney wrote in a news release.A source tells Yahoo Finance Peltz was not offered a board observer role as had been previously reported by other media outfits. Instead, the source says Peltz was offered information sharing under a non-disclosure agreement, and an opportunity to meet with management and the board quarterly.According to Thursday's statement, Peltz had expressed interest in joining Disney's board as early as July and had multiple conversations with former Disney CEO Bob Chapek before picking up discussions with Iger on Nov. 23 — three days after he was re-appointed to the executive position.During that November meeting, Trian representatives reportedly emphasized they did not want to engage in a lengthy and costly proxy fight, and voiced support over Iger's return.At that time, Disney raised the idea of a mutually agreed upon independent director being added to the Board, but Trian doubled down that representation by a Trian partner was intended ""to foster an ownership mentality in the boardroom"" and ""stimulate additional discussion among Disney directors regarding the challenges faced by the Company,"" the statement revealed.Executive Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger arrives at the world premiere for the film 'The King's Man' at Leicester Square in London, Britain December 6, 2021.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nike (NKE).Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Nike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in NKE?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.4% over the past month to $3.10.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nike may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of the bank fell 2.4% in premarket trading.Wells Fargo &amp; Co dropped 2.6% after reporting a 50% plunge in quarterly profit as the bank stockpiled money to prepare for soured loans against the backdrop of a weaker economy.Bank of America Corp was an outlier among big banks, rising 0.6% after reporting a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as rate hikes helped it charge more interest on loans to customers.Earnings from big banks were viewed as a major test of the strength of corporate America in the backdrop of sharp interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to curb decades-high inflation.Wall Street's main indexes gained on Thursday after consumer prices fell for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years last month, fueling hopes for a sustained downward trend in inflation that could give the Fed room to scale down the size of its rate hikes.Money market participants see a 90.6% chance the Fed will hike the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in February, but see the terminal rate at 4.9% by June after the December inflation print.Hopes of a less hawkish monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve have supported equities in 2023, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 on track for their best weekly performance since November 2022.Story continuesInvestors will also closely monitor University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for January, while tracking comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari to assess the strength of the U.S. economy.At 7:06 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 85 points, or 0.25%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were down 14.25 points, or 0.36%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 58 points, or 0.5%.Tesla Inc fell 5.1% in premarket trading after slashing prices on its electric vehicles in the United States and Europe by as much as 20% after missing 2022 deliveries estimates.Delta Air Lines Inc fell 3.8% as the company forecast current-quarter profit below expectations on higher operating costs.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market capitalization of $89.538 billion.Fundsmith made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) seems intent on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It has taken a leading position in online payments and parlayed that into a lamentable share price performance. The elements in this would appear to be a disregard for engagement with the customers newly acquired during the pandemic and no obvious attention to or control of costs. This is hardly surprising given the attention devoted to pursuing some clearly over-priced acquisitions. That is what happens when management start to conclude that investments do not need to earn an adequate return.We sold our stakes in Johnson &amp; Johnson, Starbucks, Kone, Intuit and PayPal and purchased stakes in Mettler-Toledo, Adobe, Otis and Apple. This seems a lot of names for what is not a lot of turnover as in some cases the size of the holding sold or bought was small. We have held five of our portfolio companies since inception in 2010.We had held PayPal shares since it was spun out from eBay in 2015. We tried to engage with PayPal as we identified, seemingly long before the management, that their lack of engagement with new customers was a problem as was cost control and that their acquisitions were value destroying. In particular, we pointed out that the value destroying acquisitions might be avoided if the management remuneration incentives included some measure of return on capital. A representative of the board kindly told us they would think about that.”Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 19% gain over the past four weeks.The uptick was owing to the bullish guidance given by UAL's peer American Airlines for fourth-quarter 2022. AAL's bullish guidance was owing to the stronger-than-expected rebound in air-travel demand from pandemic lows. UAL's fourth-quarter 2022 results should also benefit from upbeat passenger revenues owing to the buoyant air-travel demand. UAL is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 17.This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +229.4%. Revenues are expected to be $12.25 billion, up 49.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For United, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 43.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

The company has a solid earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.77%.United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS Surprise United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-eps-surprise | United Airlines Holdings Inc Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for United Airlines this earnings season.Q4 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for United Airlines’ fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $12.25 billion, indicating 49.52% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery of air-travel demand (post the pandemic-led slump) and an improvement in passenger revenues (which accounts for more than 80% of total revenues). Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenue per available seat mile to increase in the 24%-25% band in the December quarter from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.On the flip side, high fuel costs per gallon are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the fourth quarter. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.61 in the fourth quarter, much higher than the reported figure in fourth-quarter 2021.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -0.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.Highlights of Q3United Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.02 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimates of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.2% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings:American Airlines AAL has an Earnings ESP of +5.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust Corporation?For Northern Trust Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northern Trust Corporation would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of -1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northern Trust Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.95 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.69 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

214,cfcc5276-9fbc-33b9-ab9b-40ba9e0fbe7e,PNC,2023-01-13,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-141002601.html,1673532602,STORY,['PNC'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last. People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.57 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.17%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 10.2%. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Preferred Bank (PFBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.55 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.07% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 2.43% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 13.16% over the past year. Check Preferred Bank (PFBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 3.62%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

215,d77a85cf-0941-4b98-8621-781e18a4dc9f,TGT,2023-01-13,Egg prices soar nearly 60% as some retail locations see low supply,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/egg-prices-soar-nearly-60-as-some-retail-locations-see-low-supply-184226355.html,1673548946,STORY,"['WMT', 'BJ', 'TGT', 'MCD']","[The cost of eggs stood out in Thursday's CPI report — rising 59.9% year-over-year and 11.1% month-over-month from November to December.This marked the largest monthly increase since April 2020 and the largest annual jump since September 1973, according to Steve Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).Eggs, he said, single-handedly brought up the cost of groceries in December, which rose 0.2% month-over-month. ""If you sort of removed eggs, if you took eggs out of [the 'food at home' category], it would have been virtually flat. Eggs were over 90% of that increase,"" he said. As of December, the cost of grade A large eggs per dozen was $4.25.What's behind the spike in price? The avian flu outbreak.""The total size of the U.S. egg-laying flock decreased by about 10% when roughly 40 million laying hens caught the disease and were subsequently destroyed in 2022,"" Kevin Bergquist, an analyst at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute told Yahoo Finance.As a result, the total egg production dropped by about 5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.David Anderson, professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&amp;M, said production expenses triggered record high prices, too.""Feed costs have been much higher for a couple of years now. As feed prices went up, profits went down, and the economic response to that is to produce less, so we had been producing slightly fewer egg laying chickens any way, prior to [avian flu] hitting,"" he said.Anderson added: ""A small change in supply or quantity produced generates a much larger increase in price. In other words, if the price goes up, consumers are going to buy eggs anyway, or that they will not cut back very much at all. There is really not a substitute for an egg in my egg McMuffin, or my omelette. You pretty much have to have eggs.""In addition, holiday baking led to an increase in demand, he said.Impact on retailers? As a result of supply issues, some retailers are limiting customers' egg purchases.Story continuesOn Nov. 29, Yahoo Finance spotted this sign at a BJ's Wholesale Club limiting 2 egg cartons per a customer. BJ's did not respond to a request for comment.A Whole Foods in Brooklyn recently imposed a similar limit.Taken at a BJ's Wholesale Club in New York on Nov. 29th, 2022 (Courtesy: Yahoo Finance).Other major retailers are holding off on limits.A Target (TGT) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we are experiencing low inventory of some egg products, it ultimately depends on the brand. We are not limiting guest purchases at this time.""The current average sale price of Target's private label 12 count of Good &amp; Gather conventional eggs is $4.26, a cent higher than the current national average for U.S. cities.A Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we have some regions of the country that have seen some tightness in supply, we are seeing improved supply on eggs right now and have recovered from a challenging holiday season which had very high demand and impacts due to avian flu ... We do not have any purchase limits on eggs.""When will prices go down? With the Easter Holiday around the corner, it may take a while for consumers to see relief in egg prices.""We typically see egg prices peak in the spring, especially table eggs because of Easter and Easter egg hunts. That provides a boost to egg demand and prices. That is coming up pretty soon, so that demand will likely keep egg prices high in coming months,"" Anderson said.Anderson is optimistic, though.""I do expect as we go further into 2023 that increases in production will begin to catch up to and surpass the disease losses so production will expand, we’ll get back to the 327 million or so egg layers and prices will come down,"" Anderson said.Wells Fargo's Bergquist was confident, too, saying, ""We expect a slight decline between now and Easter, when prices will likely spike again. However, we don’t anticipate a retraction back to pre-bird flu levels. If the outbreak dissipates over the next six months, flock-laying birds will slowly rebuild, increasing egg supplies and helping alleviate high egg prices in the long term. Summer egg prices are usually much lower than the holiday seasons, and that could happen again in 2023.""And per the USDA, inventory is on the rise and prices are starting to fall.""During the last week of 2022, inventory sizes started to rise, and prices fell. Going forward, wholesale prices are expected to decrease as the industry moves past the holiday season and continues rebuilding its egg-laying flocks.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

COF and Navient Corp. NAVI.Industry: Consumer LoansLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2038317/2-consumer-loan-stocks-to-gain-despite-grim-industry-prospectsThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of muted consumer sentiments, mainly attributable to sky-high inflation, geopolitical matters and recessionary fears. This will, therefore, gradually dampen the demand for consumer loans and hamper top-line growth. Weakening asset quality as economic growth continues to slow down is a major headwind.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Hence, companies like Capital One Financial Corp. and Navient Corp. are worth considering despite industry challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments.In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsSubdued Consumer Sentiments: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply-chain disruptions and inflation (though now somewhat moderating) continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Despite this, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) increased in December. But this seems to be largely supported by “jobs, wages, and declining gas prices.”Story continuesLynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said, “The Present Situation and Expectations Indexes improved due to consumers’ more favorable view regarding the economy and jobs. Inflation expectations retreated in December to their lowest level since September 2021, with recent declines in gas prices a major impetus. Vacation intentions improved but plans to purchase homes and big-ticket appliances cooled further. This shift in consumers’ preference from big-ticket items to services will continue in 2023, as will headwinds from inflation and interest rate hikes.”Consumer spending will face headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates in the coming months. This will thereby result in lower demand for consumer loans. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be hampered.Credit Quality May Worsen: Since March 2020, the U.S. administration has provided substantial financial assistance to individuals through various packages to overcome pandemic-related challenges. However, with the stimulus packages gradually stopping and the Federal Reserve signaling continued monetary policy tightening to tame inflation, there is a strong likelihood that the U.S. economy might be slipping into a “mild” recession in the near term.Also, going by the central bank’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will grow 0.5% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024, lower than the prior projection of 1.2% for this year and 1.7% for the next. These factors may severely curtail the consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers will have to build additional reserves to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays owing to the economic slowdown. This will, thereby, lead to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it at the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a disappointing earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have moved 7.6% lower.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar despite industry headwinds, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 32.5% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have declined 17.3% and 14.7%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of price-to-tangible book (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their results from one quarter to the next, the industry currently trades at 1.06. The highest level of 1.54X and a median of 1.18X are recorded over the past five years.This compares with the S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 9.99X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.70X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio.2 Consumer Loan Stocks to Keep an Eye OnCapital One: Headquartered in McLean, VA, the company is primarily focused on consumer and commercial lending as well as deposit origination. Strength in credit card and online banking operations, decent loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion initiatives will keep supporting Capital One’s financials.With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to control inflation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s NII and NIM are expected to witness improvements. Also, its Credit Card segment is likely to continue showing strength. Strong growth opportunities in card loans and purchase volumes are expected despite an intensely competitive environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally higher for 2022 over the past 30 days. Also, COF’s shares have lost 3.5% over the past six months.Navient: This Zacks Rank #3 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology, cost control efforts and inorganic expansion strategy will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Further, the improving economy and declining unemployment rate should provide support to the company.Strengthening its asset recovery and business process outsourcing capabilities, NAVI has entered into several acquisition deals since 2015. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Its shares have rallied 17.1% over the past six months. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2022 and 2023.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

223,6f1c8bf1-1ad6-3d59-8134-4d1326a5961f,NAVI,2023-01-13,2 Consumer Loan Stocks to Gain Despite Grim Industry Prospects,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-consumer-loan-stocks-gain-131701156.html,1673529421,STORY,"['NAVI', '^GSPC', 'COF-PJ']","[The Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of muted consumer sentiments, mainly attributable to sky-high inflation, geopolitical matters and recessionary fears. This will, therefore, gradually dampen the demand for consumer loans and hamper top-line growth. Weakening asset quality as economic growth continues to slow down is a major headwind.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Hence, companies like Capital One Financial Corporation COF and Navient Corporation NAVI are worth considering despite industry challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments. In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsSubdued Consumer Sentiments: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply-chain disruptions and inflation (though now somewhat moderating) continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Despite this, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) increased in December. But this seems to be largely supported by “jobs, wages, and declining gas prices.”Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said, “The Present Situation and Expectations Indexes improved due to consumers’ more favorable view regarding the economy and jobs. Inflation expectations retreated in December to their lowest level since September 2021, with recent declines in gas prices a major impetus. Vacation intentions improved but plans to purchase homes and big-ticket appliances cooled further. This shift in consumers’ preference from big-ticket items to services will continue in 2023, as will headwinds from inflation and interest rate hikes.”Consumer spending will face headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates in the coming months. This will thereby result in lower demand for consumer loans. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be hampered.Credit Quality May Worsen: Since March 2020, the U.S. administration has provided substantial financial assistance to individuals through various packages to overcome pandemic-related challenges. However, with the stimulus packages gradually stopping and the Federal Reserve signaling continued monetary policy tightening to tame inflation, there is a strong likelihood that the U.S. economy might be slipping into a “mild” recession in the near term.Also, going by the central bank’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will grow 0.5% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024, lower than the prior projection of 1.2% for this year and 1.7% for the next. These factors may severely curtail the consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers will have to build additional reserves to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays owing to the economic slowdown. This will, thereby, lead to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it at the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a disappointing earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have moved 7.6% lower.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar despite industry headwinds, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 32.5% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have declined 17.3% and 14.7%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of price-to-tangible book (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their results from one quarter to the next, the industry currently trades at 1.06. The highest level of 1.54X and a median of 1.18X are recorded over the past five years.This compares with the S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 9.99X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.70X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)2 Consumer Loan Stocks to Keep an Eye onCapital One: Headquartered in McLean, VA, the company is primarily focused on consumer and commercial lending as well as deposit origination. Strength in credit card and online banking operations, decent loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion initiatives will keep supporting Capital One’s financials.With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to control inflation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s NII and NIM are expected to witness improvements. Also, its Credit Card segment is likely to continue showing strength. Strong growth opportunities in card loans and purchase volumes are expected despite an intensely competitive environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally higher for 2022 over the past 30 days. Also, COF’s shares have lost 3.5% over the past six months.Price and Consensus: COF Navient: This Zacks Rank #3 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology, cost control efforts and inorganic expansion strategy will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Further, the improving economy and declining unemployment rate should provide support to the company.Strengthening its asset recovery and business process outsourcing capabilities, NAVI has entered into several acquisition deals since 2015. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Its shares have rallied 17.1% over the past six months. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2022 and 2023.Price and Consensus: NAVIWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

229,e14c690a-74c4-3f2c-9ac7-ee348ef2fbff,V,2023-01-13,Is Visa Inc.'s (NYSE:V) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-recent-120035143.html,1673611235,STORY,['V'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Visa's (NYSE:V) stock increased significantly by 22% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Visa's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Visa How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Visa is:42% = US$15b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.42 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Visa's Earnings Growth And 42% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Visa has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 15% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Visa was able to see a decent net income growth of 10% over the last five years.We then compared Visa's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is V worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether V is currently mispriced by the market.Is Visa Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In Visa's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 23% (or a retention ratio of 77%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Besides, Visa has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 20% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Visa's future ROE will rise to 52% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Visa's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

The drop was the worst since February 2020.Reflecting faltering world demand, outbound shipments to the United States shrank 19.5% in December, while those to the EU fell 17.5%, according to Reuters' calculations based on the official data.Despite the sharp falloff in shipments in the last few months, China's total exports rose 7% in 2022 thanks to its strong trade with Southeast Asian nations as well as an export boom of new energy vehicles. Still, growth was a far cry from a 29.6% gain in 2021.Imports fell 7.5% last month, moderating from a 10.6% decline in November and better than a forecast 9.8% decline.China's 2022 trade surplus hit an all-time peak of $877.6 billion, the highest since records started in 1950, compared with $670.4 billion in 2021.Story continuesDOMESTIC DEMAND KEY TO 2023 RECOVERYBoosting domestic consumption will be vital to Beijing's economic recovery plans, and there is lots of lost ground to recover -- imports rose only 1.1% last year, down sharply from 30% growth in 2021.China's purchases of coal and copper shrank in December, as industrial activity slowed on a surge in COVID-19 infections.Policymakers have pledged to increase support for the economy as they are eager to underpin growth and ease disruptions caused by the sudden end to COVID-19 curbs.Measures to ease a crippling funding crunch in the property sector, in particular, could revive home sales and boost imports of industrial materials from iron ore to copper.Lloyd Chan, senior economist at Oxford Economics, expects more support for property developers and households, but said net trade is still likely to be a drag on China's growth this year.""Any near-term lift is unlikely given weak domestic sentiment and the ongoing COVID surge.""WEAK GLOBAL DEMAND COULD TEMPER ECONOMIC RECOVERYChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday that slowing external demand and the rising risks of a global recession are posing the biggest pressures to the country's trade stabilisation, leaving ""arduous tasks.""An official factory activity survey showed a sub-index of new export orders has remained in contraction territory for 20 consecutive months.But the ministry said major exporting provinces have reported seeing some improvement in getting new orders. After three years, Chinese authorities have finally removed anti-virus curbs that disrupted port logistics and shut down factories in key manufacturing hubs.REBOUNDAnalysts polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth to rebound to 4.9% in 2023, before steadying in 2024, a Reuters poll showed.The economy likely grew just 2.8% in 2022 amid widespread lockdowns, well below the official target of around 5.5%. Fourth quarter and 2022 gross domestic product data (GDP) data will be released on Jan. 17.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday she expected China to become a net contributor to the global economy by mid-2023, and urged Beijing to stay the course in reversing its earlier zero-COVID policy.Analysts at the Bank of America expect China's consumption to have a ""faster and sharper"" rebound than that seen in the rest of Asia.But some manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook.Jin Chaofeng, whose company in the east coast city of Hangzhou exports outdoor rattan furniture, said he has no market expansion or hiring plans for 2023.""With the lifting of COVID curbs, domestic demand is expected to improve but not for exports...,"" he said.""With no signs of the ending of the Russia-Ukraine war or crucial improvement in China-U.S. relations, this year's exports may be worse than 2022,"" Jin said, adding his company has been reducing inventories over recent months.(Reporting by Ellen Zhang and Joe Cash; Additional reporting by Shen Yan, Liangping Gao and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Bernard Orr and Kim Coghill)]"
232,0aad3e2e-2f5d-33b4-9e64-62e8c226c99b,MAR,2023-01-13,Weekly Comic:  Winter has come - can spring be far behind?,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-comic-winter-come-spring-210710405.html,1673557630,STORY,"['HG=F', 'KW=F']","[By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- One of the constants of financial markets is that multilateral development banks are among the slowest institutions to update their economic forecasts: by the time the bureaucrats at Washington’s Bretton Woods sisters have crafted their research in a way that satisfies the honor of all the various stakeholders, markets have long moved on.So much so, in fact, that some are inclined to use them as contrarian indicators of where markets are heading next. The number-crunchers in Wall Street and London, incentivized not only to be right but to be right first, are already looking at the next big trend.The Paris-based OECD and the International Monetary Fund both warned of the risk of a global recession at the end of last year, and the World Bank’s latest issue of its Global Economic Prospects is just as gloomy, saying that global growth will slow to 1.7% this year. Only in two of the last 30 years – in 2009 and 2020 – has it been slower. Last year's monetary policy tightening means this year's credit crunch, especially for developing countries: the World Bank estimates that 1 in 5 is now effectively shut out of global debt markets, up from 1 in 15 before the pandemic.But global markets are behaving as if all that is old hat. The release on Thursday of figures showing that the U.S. inflation rate fell for a sixth straight month has emboldened hopes that not only will the Federal Reserve stop raising interest rates soon, it may even cut them before the end of the year as fears about the economy replace fears about inflation.In China, meanwhile, the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday will see animal spirits unleashed on a massive scale, as 20% of the world’s population takes advantage of the freedom to travel on its biggest holiday for the first time in three years. The surge of outbound tourism is likely to provide real support to currencies in southeast Asia and further afield: Thailand’s baht has already risen 5% this year in anticipation.Story continuesOil import quotas issued to the country’s refiners for 2023 are reported by Reuters to be up by some 20% or more from a year ago – news of which pushed crude prices up by nearly $5 a barrel over the last week despite signs of an alarming slowdown in demand in the U.S.China’s abandonment of its Covid-Zero policy – which is admittedly likely to be stiffly tested by a wave of infections after the Lunar New Year - has changed calculations across the commodity markets. Iron ore is up 50% from its December lows, while copper – habitually the best proxy for global growth - is up 11% on the week, Aluminum is at a 7-month high and wheat, and Soybeans are both up by between 5% and 10% from their recent lows.In the U.S., the December CPI and Labor Market Report have bolstered fading hopes that the Fed may yet achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Comments from central bank officials suggesting that rates need to rise to 5% or more and then stay there are increasingly being interpreted as merely efforts to stop the market getting ahead of itself by pricing in rate cuts too early.The European Central Bank, like the Fed, refuses to countenance any let up in the fight against inflation until it can properly declare victory. However, its task is being made easier every day by the energy markets, where the massive spike that threatened to ruin most of European industry last year in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are now unwinding. Benchmark Dutch Gas Futures fell to their lowest since the invasion earlier this week, and even if they are still three time the prices that prevailed before the war started, they spent much of last summer at 10 times prewar levels. The improvement is not to be sniffed at.But at least two big tests lie ahead: first markets will need to be convinced that the rise in commodity prices – especially oil – doesn’t start a new wave of inflation itself, which could force markets to take hawkish Fed talk more seriously.Second, COVID could yet make a comeback in China if new variants thrive in a country of rebounding mobility and semi-effective vaccines, sending its consumer sector back into a funk and causing widespread and extended problems in the manufacturing and logistics sectors.It’s unlikely to be all plain sailing from here, but as long as the development banks are still gloomy, the downside in 2023 should be limited.Related ArticlesWeekly Comic: Winter has come - can spring be far behind?Japan yields break central bank ceiling as markets press for policy shiftIMF chief expects to keep 2023 global growth forecast steady at about 2.7%]"

Protesters have called for his release, her resignation and quick elections.Antapaccay called on authorities to ""focus on dialogue to find viable solutions to what the country is going through.""Later on Thursday, miner Minsur said it was temporarily suspending operations at its San Rafael mine, one of the largest tin mines in the world.Minsur said the decision to close its Puno mine was made ""in solidarity"" with the victims of the protest clashes, with 17 civilians killed in the same region earlier this week.

Both instruments were set to rise nearly 2% this week.The dollar sank to a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on Friday after data showed U.S. consumer price index inflation fell to its slowest pace in a year during December. The trend of softening inflation is likely to invite an eventual shift in the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric.Growing expectations of this shift have spurred a sharp rally in gold since late-December, given that it heralds some relief for the yellow metal after it was battered by a sharp rise in interest rates throughout 2022.Markets are now pricing in a nearly 95% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points in its February meeting, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose slightly on Friday, but were set for a stellar week of gains after China recently reopened its international borders following three years of lockdowns.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $4.1755 a pound- their highest level in seven months. They were also set to gain nearly 7% this week.Economic growth in China is expected to eventually recover this year, driving renewed strength in global copper demand as the country ramps up infrastructure spending.

The commission has argued that the deal would hinder competition in the video-game industry and has scheduled an in-house trial for August. Either company could be called to testify as part of the FTC trial.Google and Nvidia provided information that backs a key FTC contention — that Microsoft could gain an unfair advantage in the market for cloud, subscription and mobile gaming — according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. In its remarks to the FTC, Nvidia stressed the need for equal and open access to game titles but didn’t directly oppose the acquisition, according to one of the people.Microsoft first announced the Activision deal almost a year ago, looking to add blockbuster games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to a business that already includes the Xbox console, the Halo franchise and Minecraft world-building software. But regulators fear that Microsoft could make it harder for rival platforms to get unfettered access to Activision’s most popular titles.Shares of Activision dipped to session lows after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock is currently trading at $76.75 in New York, well below the $95-a-share bid, suggesting that investors see closing the deal as an uphill fight. Microsoft rose less than 1% to $237.88.Story continuesRead more: Microsoft’s Activision fight is a bet on the future of gamingNvidia and Google are both major forces in the industry. Nvidia leads the market for graphics cards prized by gamers and operates a streaming service called GeForce Now. Google competes with Microsoft in cloud-computing services and offered an unsuccessful game service called Stadia that is shutting down this month.Google’s Android mobile operating system also is central to how millions of people play video games. Sony, whose PlayStation console competes with Microsoft’s Xbox, has previously argued that it sees the Activision deal as anti-competitive.Representatives for Google and Nvidia declined to comment.Microsoft said it’s open to addressing concerns about the deal. It reached a 10-year pact to bring Activision’s Call of Duty to Nintendo Co. gaming platforms and agreed to release future versions of the game on Valve Corp.’s Steam platform at the same time as they debut on Xbox.“We are prepared to address and have been proactively addressing issues raised by regulators or competitors to ensure that the deal closes with confidence,” Microsoft spokesman David Cuddy said. “We want people to have more access to games, not less.”Still, the feedback adds heft to the argument that Microsoft could tie more exclusive content to its Xbox Game Pass service, which already leads the market for gaming subscriptions. In its defense, Microsoft has said that regulators are giving too much weight to concerns raised by Sony. In addition to publicly decrying the transaction, Sony has said in filings with Brazilian and UK regulators that the deal will harm competition and give Microsoft an insurmountable edge in the nascent cloud gaming industry.In its own filings, Microsoft has said that Sony’s concerns are “self-serving” and overstate the importance of Activision’s catalog. The software giant also has attempted to make concessions. It offered Sony a 10-year deal that would give the PlayStation console access to Call of Duty. A person familiar with those discussions said the offer also included the right to place the games on Sony’s subscription services.Read more: FTC says no settlement talks are underway on Microsoft dealGoogle’s Stadia spotlighted the challenges of competing in cloud gaming. It was launched in 2019 with original content, and the company hired hundreds of game developers to work on the project. But Stadia never caught on with gamers, and Google announced plans in September to close the platform. It’s set to wind down on Jan. 18.Politico reported in November, prior to the FTC’s lawsuit, that Google had concerns about the Activision deal.Nvidia, meanwhile, opened its GeForce Now service to the public in 2020, providing access to high-end gaming hardware over the internet. The company allows subscribers to play games they already own, streamed from its servers.Last August, Nvidia said it had 20 million subscribers. More recently, the company said it’s able to support more than 1,400 titles, allowing consumers to use basic devices such as Chromebooks and handhelds to play the most demanding games.But Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which includes cloud gaming in its Ultimate package, remains the leading service — with more than 25 million subscribers. In part, that’s because Microsoft’s dozens of game studios provide a direct channel of content. Activision is expected to make the subscription service even more compelling.(Updates with Microsoft comment in the ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekIt’s a Business Free-for-All in a Russia Transformed by SanctionsThe Winklevii Are the Latest Crypto Founders to Blame Everybody But ThemselvesWhat Tech Job Cuts Say About Silicon Valley—and the Rest of the EconomyAirlines Resurrect Ancient Jumbo Jets to Meet First- and Business-Class DemandWith VC Funding Drying Up, Biotechs Are on a Quest for Cash©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Shipments of PCs fell a whopping 28% year-over-year in Q4, according to Gartner, and the market likely won’t return to growth for some time.But Microsoft (MSFT) and its PC manufacturing partners are pushing forward regardless of the downturn, rolling out a slew of new features and capabilities that they believe will draw in consumers ranging from the average person to hardcore gamers.“In the current climate, customers are being thoughtful about purchase decisions, and that’s true for PCs as well,” Microsoft chief partner officer and CVP for global partner solutions Nicole Dezen told Yahoo Finance. “Our partners are focused on building the right PCs, with the right features and value for the price point.”Throughout 2023, PC makers are debuting everything from systems with new AI chips to high-powered gaming rigs. During CES 2023 in Las Vegas, chip makers Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD) each debuted new offerings, including what Intel says is the “fastest mobile chip in the world,” Nvidia’s high-end RTX 4090 mobile graphics chip and AMD’s Ryzen 7045HX processor.An Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop with eye tracking for glasses free 3D video gaming is displayed at the Microsoft Inc. booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2023.

FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Part of the pitch for PCs in 2023 comes in the form of new AI capabilities that companies say will improve things like video chat quality over computers without AI features.“Partners are integrating AI chips and workloads into their Windows PCs for improved customer experiences in areas like gaming, video conferencing and computer augmentation,” Dezen explained.It’s not just AI and high-powered processors, though. Dezen says that her customers regard security as a top priority for their systems.Getting consumers and businesses to purchase new PCs in 2023, however, will be a tall order regardless of how many new features PC makers offer.“The anticipation of a global recession, increased inflation, and higher interest rates have had a major impact on PC demand,” Mikako Kitagawa, director analyst at Gartner said in a statement.Story continues“Since many consumers already have relatively new PCs that were purchased during the pandemic, a lack of affordability is superseding any motivation to buy, causing consumer PC demand to drop to its lowest level in years.”We’ll just have to see if Microsoft and its partners can overcome the collapse in demand, and help pull the PC market back to growth.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanApple says it’s paid out $320 billion to developers since 2008 as App Store fight heats upCES 2023: One of the most popular gadgets at the show goes in your toiletBMW debuts i Vision Dee concept, a car that can change colors and smile at youGot a tip?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the engineering profession, its impact on the economy and the corporate tech sector around the world and go directly to the 5 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the World. Engineering can perhaps be thought of as one of the most important human endeavors in the modern age beside science. The two fields complement each other. Scientists theorize about nature and engineers apply those theories into practical applications, making our technological world possible. So engineering is central to technological progress and the latter is crucial for economic growth in advanced economies. For instance, the correlation between Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and economic progress in advanced countries is a positive 60%, with technological growth being one of the three factors in TFP. Naturally therefore, there’s a high demand for engineers, leading them to earn handsome salary packages, which in turn, creates demand for engineering education. Engineering-Fields OutlookTraditionally, electronics and electrical engineering have dominated the overall field. However, things are slowing down, at-least at the moment, due to disrupted supply chains, resulting in materials shortage and an endemic shortage of engineers. A survey shows 76.41% of corporations are having trouble finding engineers. The shortage is mostly due to a declining interest in STEM, aging workforce and engineers moving into managerial roles. The report went on to illustrate that there has roughly been a 90% drop in electrical-engineering graduates, offset by a 90% increase in computer-science graduates over the past half a century. This has led to software engineering becoming the new hot engineering field. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that software engineers are some of the highest income-earners in the US, with an average annual salary of $131,490. In addition, the IT employment in the country is projected to grow by 21% during 2021-2031, faster than all other occupations.Story continuesAI engineers are the most in demand within the larger software-development industry and also earn higher than their regular software-engineering peers, due to the lightning-fast rate of progress in machine learning and its impact on other industries.  According to Indeed, the median salary for a machine learning engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area is nearly $170,000, significantly higher than the average income of a regular software engineer.In terms of academia, National University of Singapore, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harbin Institute of Technology are considered some of the top schools for engineering disciplines. When it comes to the corporate sector, tech giants like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are prominent when it comes to hiring electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineers.  General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is the most diverse company when it comes to electrical engineering in the US. On the software front, there are companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).The US, Japan and Germany are some of the most advanced countries in engineering. Below, we list the 12 countries that produce the best engineers in the world. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the WorldCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology For our list of the best countries in engineering, we’ve ranked them based on the averaged-out rankings from two reports -  The Global Innovation Index Report of 2021 and Scimago Journal and Country Ranks. We've picked up two sub-metrics from the two reports and averaged out the rankings based on them. We have used 'Knowledge and Technology Output' metric from the Global Innovation Index Report and H-Index for engineering papers from the Scimago Journal and Country Rank.The former accounts for technological output and the quality of technical academic knowledge required for the purpose. This gives us a useful indication of which countries have high-quality educational infrastructure for engineering.The latter, on the other hand, measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output. It lets us know which countries' engineers are leading their respective fields in R&amp;D. An H-index of 20 means that for all academic publications by an engineer, 20 of them have been cited by other researchers at-least 20 times.We’ve also discussed R&amp;D spending, whose data comes from the World Bank. In addition, we’ve mentioned top engineering universities, as well as tech companies in these countries, whose data comes from Scimago Institutions Rankings. Here are the 12 countries that produce the best engineers in the world. 12.

Still, the fund manager has a compelling case to push for change, with Disney's stock price down 36% over the last 52 weeks.Weeks of discussion last year ended with Disney denying Peltz's request for a board seat leaving the parties embroiled in what bankers and lawyers say may become one the most expensive and explosive proxy contests in recent history.Longtime Disney CEO Iger returned late last year to help stanch losses from the fledgeling streaming service Disney+. Three years ago, Iger had invited Peltz to speak to Disney's board about his philosophy, Peltz's firm Trian Fund Management said and a source close to Disney confirmed. At that time Trian did not own Disney stock.Then Trian amassed a 0.5% stake in Disney last year and Peltz wanted a bigger voice and vote after criticizing capital spending, past acquisitions and a bungled succession plan.When he requested a board seat, Disney balked and instead offered an ""information sharing agreement."" This would let Peltz speak with the management team and the board but not have a vote as a director.Iger and other directors agree Disney needs to cut costs, and many cuts have already been announced. They say they want to continue the dialogue with Peltz but expressed concern that had not made concrete suggestions to address the problems he identified, people familiar with the company's thinking said.Media analyst Michael Nathanson agreed with Peltz and wrote in a note that ""many of Disney's wounds are self-inflicted,"" but expressed confidence in Iger's ability to ""make the difficult decisions"" required to improve Disney's long-term profitability.Story continuesPeltz and his colleagues mostly negotiate for changes out of the limelight and have been invited by 15 companies, including Unilever Plc and Invesco Ltd, to join the board. Peltz himself has served on 11 boards. At three -- Procter &amp; Gamble, H.J. Heinz and DuPont de Nemours -- Trian waged boardroom battles that went to a vote where all investors got a say on whether Trian should have a seat.While those three companies worked hard to keep Trian out, their CEOs later lauded the firm's collaborative efforts and insights. Mostly Peltz's medicine worked as Trian said companies where he was on the board outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 stock index by 9% during his tenure.For Disney, however, Peltz may be an especially aggravating activist, arriving shortly after Third Point's billionaire founder Daniel Loeb showed up again last year. Disney and Loeb engaged in conversations and the two sides quickly agreed to add media executive Carolyn Everson to the Disney board.FASTER FASTERMany times activist investors push corporations for changes the company may already be considering. But they want management to act faster and more broadly.Indeed Peltz may be betting the playbook he used at P&amp;G will work at Disney too. This includes updating aging brands, simplifying bureaucracy and bringing along binders of information and data to find new ways of doing things.With Disney's stock swooning, investors are unhappy and may be ready to back Peltz in a vote, investors and advisers who are not permitted to speak publicly said on Thursday.Firms including T.Rowe Price, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Nuveen and Dimensional Fund Advisors are invested in Disney and are invested in P&amp;G as well where they saw shares climb with Peltz on the board.In his current battle, Peltz may be helped by new U.S. regulations that allow investors to see all director candidates on a so-called universal proxy card. Bankers and lawyers say this process may make it easier for activists like Peltz to win at least one board seat at an election. This is because investors can now pick and choose instead of selecting either all of the activist's choices or the company choices.""Even though Disney has publicly rebuffed Peltz's agenda, this proxy battle is likely to cause more ripples,"" said Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""In the current climate, with Disney's stock underperforming the market and a slew of unfavorable economic conditions and business dynamics, Peltz may have more leverage to force Disney's hand.""(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss with additional reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

For next year, estimates have gone from $1.27 to $1.49, or 17%.The stock saw a price upgrade right after the report as Susquehanna took its targets from $22 to $25. More recently, Société Générale reiterated its Hold rating, but took its price target higher from $22.60 to $24.90.The Technical TakeThe stock has been all over the place over the last two years, but is currently trading in the middle of its trading range during that period. The question for investors is if this stock will see sideways trading or if the price will get back to the 2021 highs near $33.The good news is that the recent earnings strength has taken the stock over all its major moving averages. For those looking for dips to MA support levels, the 200-day is at $20.75 and the 50-day is at $23.40.It might take a while for the stock to break out of its base after gapping higher. In the meantime, investors should feel good being long the stock if it stays above $20.In SummaryInternational Game Technology has started the year off right. Investors are clearly excited for what this stock might bring in 2023. While IGT might experience some sideways trading, the company pays a nice dividend while the story plays out.If earnings momentum can continue over the next couple quarters, look for the stock to take out 2022 highs and be one of the top performing names in 2023.Bear of the Day:Jack In The Box is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates and franchises Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants. With over 2,200 restaurants, the company is one of the largest hamburger chains in the country.After disappointing earnings, the stock traded below October lows towards the $65 level. More recently, JACK has rallied with the overall market, up 17% from December lows.Investors might be getting ahead of themselves as the upcoming quarter is likely threatened by inflationary impacts on margins.About the CompanyJACK is headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company was founded in 1951 and employs 22,000 people.JACK is valued at $1.6 billion and has a Forward PE of 14. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Value and “A” in Momentum. The company pays a dividend of 2.3%.Q4 EarningsThe company reported EPS on November 22nd, missing expectations by 1.4%. JACK reported Q4 at $1.33 v the $1.35 and revenues came in slightly better than expected. Jack In the Box saw year over year Same Store Sales growth of 4%, while Del Taco saw growth of 5.2%.The company guided FY23 operating EPS of $5.25-5.62. The guidance was disappointing to investors and the stock was sold aggressively after the earnings report.EstimatesBecause of the light guidance, analysts are lowering estimates and dropping price targets.Over the last 60 days, analyst estimates have been lowered across all time frames. For the current quarter, estimates have dropped from $2.02 to $1.72, or 14%. For the current year, they have fallen 17%, down to $5.48 from $6.60.After earnings a handful of analysts took their price targets lower. UBS went from $85 to $77, Wedbush to $100 from $115 and Barclays went to $73 from $88.Technical TakeAfter the rally in the stock over the last few weeks, JACK is finding resistance at the 200-day moving average. If the bulls fail to hold this area, the stock will likely drop back to the December trading range.Earnings are due up in late February and investors should be cautious of more trouble with margins. We likely get sideway trading until then and after earnings the chart will tell us which direction the stock may go.For now, over $80 looks bullish, but under $70 the bears are back in control.SummaryLike many restaurants, the higher costs of food and labor is starting to eat into margins. For now, the fundamental story makes the stock an avoid. While the chart looks much better, the stock is at resistance, so investors should take caution at current levels.Additional content:Disney Wins Big at Golden Globes, Outperforms NetflixThe Walt Disney won nine awards at this year’s Golden Globe, including the category of Best Picture, Musical or Comedy with The Banshees of Inisherin.

Steven Spielberg won the Best Director, Motion Picture award for the movie.Netflix had a relatively quiet Golden Globe this year, winning three awards. Guillermo del Toro became the first Latino to win the best animated feature Golden Globe for Pinocchio. The other two wins include Julia Garner for Ozark (Best Supporting Actress, Television) and Evan Peters for  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (Best Performance by an Actor, Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture made for Television).Disney’s Strong Content Portfolio Boosts ProspectsDisney, along with media companies like Comcast and Paramount, is suffering from the lingering effects of COVID-19 and intensifying competition in the saturated streaming space still dominated by Netflix.The latest Golden Globe wins reflect Disney’s strong content portfolio. Although Avatar: The Way of Water didn’t win any awards, it was one of the highest-grossing movies released in 2022. As these latest movies will be eventually released into Disney’s streaming service, Disney+, subscriber base growth is expected to remain strong. Disney+ added more than 12 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.However, Disney’s direct-to-consumer division reported an operating loss of $1.5 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, which doubled year over year. This has been attributed to macroeconomic factors like inflation, which have spiked up the cost of production for the company, as well as adverse foreign exchange impact that decreased Disney+’s ARPU by 5%.Nevertheless, Disney is focusing on the realignment of costs, including rationalization of marketing spending, and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement.

The study was commissioned by ComEd to better understand the economic and workforce development challenges and opportunities communities will face in the transition to clean energy; the results is a statewide and regional job analyses.""As evidenced by this foundational study, Illinois stands to gain tens of thousands of good-paying jobs from the transition to a clean energy future – and we must ensure that all communities benefit from this economic opportunity,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. ""This research will help ensure that, working with community partners, we can build a diverse pipeline of talent ready to power the state’s journey to a cleaner, brighter future.""The study examines the impacts to regional and statewide employment from two scenarios on the transition to a net zero energy future. It captures initial and secondary employment outputs across four sectors of the economy – electricity, fuels, transportation and buildings – and assesses opportunities for growth and areas of displacement across these four sectors to determine employment outcomes.To complement BW Research’s analysis, ComEd conducted in-depth interviews with more than a dozen local business and community groups, ranging from workforce development organizations and educational institutions to labor unions. The study incorporates insights from these interviews on the impacts of the economy and pandemic recovery on the local workforce, the effect of decarbonization on the region’s future workforce, and the need for public-private partnership to prepare for workforce needs in coming decades.Story continues""This study shows us that we’re at a unique moment in the energy space that offers a tremendous opportunity to create new jobs and bring economic prosperity to communities across Illinois,"" said Don Finn, Business Manager and Financial Secretary for IBEW Local 134. ""We’re hopeful that we can attract new jobseekers and build a diverse talent pipeline to support Illinois for generations to come.""The first scenario assumes a business-as-usual approach that examines the impact of decarbonization driven by laws such as Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) and the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on employment across the state. It assumes no additional efforts to accelerate the electrification of transportation, buildings or industry. Under this scenario, Illinois would see a net increase of 15,000 jobs between 2021 to 2030 and an increase of 38,000 jobs between 2021 to 2050.The second scenario includes the job projections under the business-as-usual approach but also factors in additional actions beyond CEJA and the IRA to achieve economywide decarbonization by 2050, with high levels of electrification and a significant role for hydrogen and gas backup for heating. This scenario finds a net increase of 41,000 jobs in Illinois between 2021 and 2030 and a net increase of 151,000 jobs between 2021 to 2050.These scenarios are the same as two of the scenarios identified in a recent independent study by national sustainability firm Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc. (E3) that outlines pathways for Illinois to achieve full, economy-wide decarbonization by 2050, consistent with the state’s pledge as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance to pursue the Paris Agreement.""Our clean energy future is going to create more and better paying jobs, and education and job training will be critical in our work to ensure all communities benefit from this economic opportunity,"" said Juan Salgado, Chancellor of City Colleges of Chicago. ""This study will help us better expand existing educational programs and build new ones that will ensure the future workforce has the training and stackable skills necessary to thrive in this sector.""The study also revealed that, under both scenarios, job quality would improve, with high paying and mid-wage jobs expected to increase by roughly seven percent under the business-as-usual scenario to 17 percent under a moderate electrification scenario.""We are working to ensure underserved communities across Chicago have access to good-paying jobs and the necessary training to qualify for these jobs,"" said Andrew Wells, Vice President of Workforce Development for the Chicago Urban League. ""Working with ComEd and others, we are committed to maximizing the opportunities presented by the clean energy future to benefit every person, particularly communities who have historically lacked access to these opportunities.""ComEd will use the study to inform its existing job training programs and internal hiring and training plans to support projected workforce needs, as well as to inform partnerships with state and local organizations to expand and develop job training programs to support the transition to clean energy. The company currently offers or supports a range of in-depth job training and apprenticeship programs, including the CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy, which, over the past decade, has helped more than 700 participants from diverse backgrounds prepare for careers in the skilled trades.Other training opportunities include the Chicago Builds program at Dunbar High School through a partnership with Chicago Public Schools and the ComEd-sponsored Overhead Electrical Line Worker Training at Dawson Technical Institute.The full study by BW Research can be accessed at https://bwresearch.com/docs/BW_ComED-Jobs&amp;EquitableEnergyTransitionStudyReport2022.pdf.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

261,da4a9de9-a054-3bb7-952f-501174455b71,MTB,2023-01-13,M&T Bank Corporation (MTB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-mtb-150003703.html,1673535603,STORY,['MTB-PH'],"[M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +29.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.37 billion, up 56.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M&amp;T Bank Corporation?For M&amp;T Bank Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.73%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that M&amp;T Bank Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that M&amp;T Bank Corporation would post earnings of $4.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.83, delivering a surprise of -9.03%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.M&amp;T Bank Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Stocks with high liquidity levels have always been in demand, owing to their potential to provide maximum returns.One needs to exercise caution before investing in such stocks. High liquidity levels may indicate that the company is clearing its dues faster than its peers. However, it may also suggest that the company cannot utilize its assets competently.Hence, an investor may consider a company’s efficiency level and liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — also known as the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also suggest that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — also called the ‘acid-test ratio’ or the ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet current debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.Story continuesA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersTo pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization — a widely-used measure of a company’s efficiency — as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.To ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios greater than 1 are desirable, significantly higCurrent Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3h ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than the industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screen:Inter Parfums IPAR manufactures, distributes and markets a wide array of fragrances and related products.

264,982a40d4-564a-3615-a1fb-afb955a56162,NDAQ,2023-01-13,Preparing for the Future: Building Climate Resilience for Your Business,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/preparing-future-building-climate-resilience-152000325.html,1673536800,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 12, 2023 / By Ekaterina Hardin and Lia BrussockWhat is Climate Resilience? Climate resilience is the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and withstand hazardous events, shifting consumer trends and behaviors, or business disturbances related to climate change.Nasdaq, Inc., Thursday, January 12, 2023, Press release pictureImproving climate resilience involves (1) assessing how climate change will create new, or alter current, climate-related risks, and (2) taking steps to better cope with these risks.Since 2020, the world has seen multiple major events - a global pandemic, a supply chain crisis, a geopolitical conflict and an overall economic volatility. These events have challenged businesses and their ability to remain resilient and to manage a range of external constraints.During the pandemic, labor shortages created clogged marine ports and made companies rely on air freight for logistics and transportation, increasing overall expenses and emissions. Corporates are looking for ways to cut their emissions that spiked during the supply chain crisis.The geopolitical crisis spiked energy and fuel costs. In absence of energy independence, the situation was worsened by the lowered production levels in the Middle East. Then recent diesel shortage added more fuel into the fire.The economic volatility felt by many in the most recent months made businesses look deep into their operations for ways to improve efficiency and cut expenses.All these challenges are linked to transitional climate risks through fuel, energy and emissions. Setting climate impacts aside, not being able to access resources at low cost also has a direct financial impact. Being able to manage these risks in 2023 and beyond will help companies demonstrate climate resilience and provide access to capital in the long term.Large Corporates Influence Their Supply Chain to Build ResilienceClimate resilience is crucial for all market participants up and down the value chain. To improve their transitional risk resilience, large corporations who have committed to net zero targets are now engaging with their critical suppliers. Large corporate clients are asking their suppliers to provide their GHG inventories, and in some cases, requiring them to set climate-related targets of their own. In this effort to pass down climate targets, these corporations are working to mitigate their own climate-related risks and improve climate resilience throughout their value chain. According to Nasdaq research, currently 58% of S&amp;P 500 companies have a climate-related goal in their 2022 Proxy Statement. In addition, over 4000 companies of all sizes are taking action to reduce their emissions by setting science-based targets through the Science Based Targets Initiative. Almost half of the 4000+ have already set Science Based targets and almost 1500 companies have made Net Zero commitments (Figure 1A). Scope 3 emission targets (indirect value chain emissions) are a significant portion of these commitments.Story continuesLarge cap companies are not the only ones committing to science-based emissions reduction targets. Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up almost 20 percent (18.6%) of the total companies listed by SBTi (Figure 1B). A total of 747 SMEs have set targets as of November 2022, in comparison to just 29 two years ago. GHG emissions reduction targets are emerging across market caps and organization types, and in many cases the influence of large corporations on their value chain is clear.We at Nasdaq ESG Advisory hear about these cascade impacts from our clients: their large corporate customers expect them to measure and to reduce their own Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprints, otherwise they risk losing their shared business. This is a significant challenge that smaller and mid-size companies can anticipate in 2023 and beyond. The tide of climate action is rising, and smaller and mid-size companies now face challenges beyond responding to investor pressures and regulatory requirements. They must also address hindered ability to conduct business with large corporate customers. By not having a climate-related target in place, supply chain participants are exposing themselves to climate-related risks that will directly impact their financial health.Global Transition to Low Carbon Economy and Geopolitical CrisisClimate resilience has also been challenged this year by the global energy crisis. The 2022 energy crisis, associated with the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine, made energy costs soar. Consequently, high prices on crude oil and natural gas increased the cost of manufacturing and spiked transportation and distribution costs. Lower production levels in the middle east that followed fuel cost increase in the US, only made the situation worse. Additionally, most recently transition to low carbon economy has been under the microscope due to diesel shortages and associated surging diesel cost.Back in 2020-2021, when marine transportation industry was clogged because of labor shortages, air freight was the only option to deliver goods to customers. Not only is air freight more carbon intensive, but it is also more costly. As a result, we saw increased emissions and narrower margins. Furthermore, in 2022 businesses that rely on fossil-based fuels for energy to produce and transport their goods saw additionally significant operational expense increases. The geopolitical crisis driving energy cost up, combined with a challenging economic environment emphasized the importance of climate resilience. While trying to stop the short-term value bleed, companies need to think about long-term resilience and build-in mitigation strategies such as self-generated energy and increased share of renewables and alternative fuels, so they can climb out of these challenging times ahead of their peers.Current Economy and Climate ResilienceIt is crucial for executives to set up their businesses for resilience in the long term, especially when markets are very volatile. In 2022, decreasing revenue growth rates and shrinking margins have been a focus for investors. Recession and inflation concerns have curbed investor appetite [Scenario Planning and Explaining Your Resilience - Nasdaq's Advice on Appealing to Investors in Challenging Times]. To build trust with external stakeholders during these times, it is important for companies to explain their resilience to macro concerns like fuel shortage, energy, and raw materials cost. Additionally, understanding the industry trends and setting differentiators from peers will build confidence in management and will help companies to secure capital needed to navigate through the challenging times. Demonstrating financial resilience and climate risks resilience go hand in hand. Companies that are highly exposed to climate-related financial risks, such as energy cost and security, cost of raw materials, cost of transportation and logistics, can prove their financial resilience by demonstrating how they manage these climate-related risks.Companies in varying sectors have different climate risk profiles, therefore, the way they demonstrate climate resilience would also be different. We encourage each company to access their business specific short-, mid- and long- term climate-related risks and put resilience strategies in place for those risks that companies cannot afford to tolerate in these downturn conditions. related risks and put resilience strategies in place for those risks that companies cannot afford to tolerate in these downturn conditions.Understanding Your Business ResilienceIn times of economic downturn and high volatility, demonstrating to stakeholders that you are an attractive investment, if revenues are down, is a challenge. Companies need to demonstrate how they are planning to capture future opportunities and curb financial risks in current economic conditions. Climate crisis often acts as a risk multiplier. It multiplies all financial risks - operational risk, credit risk, liquidity, underwriting. Being climate resilient company means being financially resilient company. It means capturing climate-related opportunities and mitigating climate-related financial risks better than your peers and competitors.Knowing what risks your company is exposed to and how they can impact the financial condition and operations of your business across several time horizons and climate futures, will help executives put appropriate resilience strategies in place and build trust with investors.Understanding industry risks and company specific resilience starts with understanding your risk exposure, risk vulnerability and your risk tolerance and how those might change in the future. For those risks that you cannot tolerate, management strategies must be put in place. At times when it is hard to justify R&amp;D spend on new technologies, products, or services, optimizing efficiencies to reduce operational costs might be the best way to capture climate opportunities and demonstrate climate resilience. By conducting a peer assessment, understanding industry trends and how to achieve a competitive advantage at lowest cost possible, companies can make a business case for themselves and demonstrate to stakeholders that they are an attractive long-term investment.The Challenges Nasdaq Sees &amp; How We Can HelpLack of climate expertise coupled with time and resources constraints are the most common pain points for corporates. Companies that are laser-focused on delivering business outcomes during challenging economic times need high efficiency and low-cost solutions. When time is money and when time needs to be spent on delivering products to the market, conducting labor- and time-intensive tasks such as peer benchmarking and assessment is a challenge for resource constrained companies. Staying on top of all the recent regulatory developments and tracking which direction political winds blow is also very time consuming and disrupting.Climate risk is a systemic risk - meaning it is a risk you cannot diversify from. However, the way it impacts each industry and company varies. Each company's path along the climate journey is unique. Businesses operate in different geographies, different sectors, have different supply chains and different stakeholders with different short- and long-term priorities. Nasdaq understands that each company has its own set of considerations, and we prepared to partner at each stage of their journey towards climate and financial resilience. Our goal at Nasdaq is to help our community build resilience and trust. We drive impact through cost-effective resources, tools, and guidance around climate data collection, risk identification, and disclosure, ultimately enabling our community to build competitive differentiation.

The company’s diversified business, robust demand across all end markets and acquisitions helped drive growth despite various adverse macroeconomic conditions, namely increased inflation, supply-chain disruptions and higher energy costs.Also, EMCOR offers a sound investment opportunity, evident from its VGM Score of A.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth remains challenged by domestic and international political developments, foreign exchange headwinds, labor market tightness, increased competition, government regulations, and the continuing threat of COVID-19 variants. Pricing and the availability of materials are directly affected by inflationary pressures and supply-chain disruptions.Focus on GrowthResilient end markets, solid Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs and bolt-on acquisitions are gaining traction. The company’s RPOs increased 22% and 15.2% year over year in 2021 and 2020, respectively. RPOs at September-end were up 32% year over year to a record $7.10 billion.EMCOR continues to see demand for electrical mechanical systems in new construction and retrofit projects.The robust business in EME’s construction operations is one of the major drivers of its financial growth. Within the U.S. construction umbrella, the U.S. Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment’s revenues increased 19.3% year over year for the third quarter, with organic revenue growth of 13.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNotably, the company benefitted from increased project activity within the commercial (exclusive of the telecommunications submarket, including data center and high-tech manufacturing projects), manufacturing, healthcare and transportation sectors.The U.S. Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segment’s revenues rose 11.2% from the year-ago level. The upside was derived from the majority of the market served, with the water and wastewater, institutional, and commercial markets experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases.Revenue growth of EME received a boost from its long-term acquisition programs. In the first nine months of 2022, EME spent $91.1 million on acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of Boston-based Gaston Electrical Co., LLC. Business diversity is also a component of inorganic growth measures followed by the company. Acquisitions were possible due to EME’s long-standing balanced capital allocation strategy, resulting in long-term value creation for its shareholders.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $11.7 billion and $9.10 per share, suggesting 6.3% and 17% growth, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.Story continuesPossible HeadwindsProduction and growth of EMCOR are mainly affected by increased supply-chain woes, high inflationary pressures and COVID-related risks. These factors lead to a reduction in the availability of raw materials, as well as increased production costs.The Russia-Ukraine war added to the uncertainty, especially with respect to energy and raw material costs.In the first nine months of 2022, the company’s gross and operating margins declined 100 basis points (bps) and 50 bps on a year-over-year basis.

272,452ff3b6-ac3d-49ef-be0d-c8b010ac42f6,ORCL,2023-01-13,Get ready for big tech deals—and IPOs—says top Silicon Valley VC,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/get-ready-for-big-tech-dealsand-ip-ossays-top-silicon-valley-vc-200702463.html,1673554022,STORY,"['PINS', 'AMZN', 'AVGO', 'VMW', 'CRM', 'ORCL']","[Don't let all that bad news coming out of Silicon Valley get you down: dealmaking's set to pick up in tech-land.Or so says Kamran Ansari, Greycroft Board Partner and former Pinterest (PINS) Head of M&amp;A on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).""My suspicion,"" said Ansari, ""is that going into the new year, Q1, Q2, you're going to see a number of additional deals announced. Particularly from private equity firms that operate in the tech space – like Thoma Bravo, Vista, and Silver Lake – and large-cap tech buyers themselves, like Amazon, Salesforce, and Oracle,"" said Ansari.Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and Oracle (ORCL) have all been active acquirers in recent years, though tech M&amp;A notably slowed in 2022 as the economy took a turn for the worse. However, slowdown aside, 2022 wasn't a total wash when it came to deals. In particular, Ansari highlighted Microsoft's (MSFT) proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Broadcom's (AVGO) $61 billion buyout of VMWare (VMW), and Adobe's (ADBE) $20 billion deal to buy interface design app Figma.There will be rough patches ahead for some deals, of course. For example: Microsoft's Activision buyout – set to be worth a whopping $69 billion – has been challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which under Chair Lina Khan has taken an active stance on reeling in Big Tech. But that aside, deals are there to be made.""I've actually been surprised there haven't been more deals because you have a combination of a lot of dry powder, both for mega-tech names and others,"" Ansari said. ""So, just giant cash stockpiles, and private equity firms that have very large cash stockpiles of funds they've raised. By the same token, you have valuation declines in both the public market and the private market. I think the opportunity is really ripe right now in the coming months for us to see quite a few M&amp;A transactions happening.""Story continuesAn image of a handshake with one hand as a cursor. Getty Creative.IPOs back, too?Though it's not imminent, we could soon see an uptick in tech IPOs. Ansari told Yahoo Finance we'll see at least some big-name public offerings this year, though perhaps not until the back half of 2023.""In the tech space, I think you have a number of companies, SpaceX and Stripe being the biggest, most-anticipated, most-IPO-ready,"" he said. ""They've been thinking about it and putting things in place for years to be able to make that happen."" (Recently, Stripe reportedly cut its internal valuation by 11% to $63 billion.)Additionally, Ansari flagged Instacart and Databricks as similarly ""well-positioned"" to go public. Instacart's particularly ready to roll, he said.""They're not looking for the perfect valuation,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""I think they've cut their internal valuation from $40 billion down to $10 billion and they're being realistic about market expectations. That's a business that also has $2 billion in revenue and has turned profitable. I think they're well-positioned to come out.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(MU) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-micron-technology-140002288.html,1673532002,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +6.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -129.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -93.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.09 points to a change of -125% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -159.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.08 indicates a change of +151.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -62.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -51.1%. The $16.4 billion and $22.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -46.7% and +39.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The operator of Mexican food restaurant chains has produced incredible returns for investors.In the past year, CMG’s price return has been virtually flat to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -16% decline and roughly match the Retail-Food &amp; Restaurants Markets +1%. Even better, over the last decade CMG’s very stellar +412% has crushed the benchmark’s +167% and its Zacks Subindustry’s +133%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChipotle’s shares currently trade at $1,512 per share and 34.7X forward earnings. This is above the industry average of 21.7X but Chipotle is a proven industry leader. Plus, Chipotle stock trades well below its decade high of 231.6X and at a 30% discount to the median of 49.6X.With Chipotle trading attractively relative to its past the stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its bottom line growth starting to stick out again as well. Chipotle’s earnings are now expected to climb 31% for its fiscal 2022 and jump another 28% in FY23 at $42.63 per share. Earnings estimates revisions have slightly gone up for both FY22 and FY23 over the last 90 days. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s MCD Another leader among fast-food restaurants that investors may want to consider adding to their portfolio in 2023 is McDonald’s. The famous burger chain has also provided strong historical returns.Amid higher inflation, McDonald’s affordable pricing has led to its stock acting as a defensive hedge against inflation. Over the last year, MCD stock is up +2% as the S&amp;P 500 dropped and this slightly edges the Retail-Food &amp; Restaurants Markets +1%. Looking at the last decade, MCD’s +190% also beats the benchmark's +167% and its Zacks Subindustry.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $266, shares of McDonald’s trade at 25.7X forward earnings which is slightly above the industry average of 21.7X. But of course, McDonald’s is a historical industry leader and trades nicely below its decade high of 38.3X and closer to the median of 22.7X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimate revisions continuing to trend higher over the last week. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now expected to be up 7% and rise another 5% in FY23 at $10.45 a share. In addition to this, McDonald’s stock also provides a very generous 2.2% annual dividend yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYum Brands YUMLast but not least is Yum Brands, which operates iconic fast-food franchises like KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. Yum Brands hasn’t had quite the stellar historical performance as McDonald’s and Chipotle stock but could surely benefit from a stronger consumer with its diverse restaurant chains.Plus, over the last year, YUM stock is virtually flat to also outperform the S&amp;P 500 and remain on par with the Retail-Food &amp; Restaurants Market. In the last decade, YUM’s +98% has trailed the benchmark and its Zack Subindustry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Yum Brands’ stock price may be attractive to some investors compared to the other stocks on the list. Yum Brands stock trades around $128 per share and 25.3X forward earnings. This is slightly above the industry average but below its decade long high of 34.4X and near the median of 24.9X.Despite earnings estimate revisions slightly down over the last quarter, Yum Brands’ bottom line growth is still solid. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to be virtually flat but pop 15% in FY23 at $5.11 per share. Like McDonald’s, Yum Brands also offers investors a solid dividend with a respectable 1.7% annual yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line With these popular retail restaurants already providing a hedge against inflation over the last year, a stronger consumer could help their stocks rally.

Gallagher boasts an impressive inorganic story. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker acquired 13 entities in the fourth quarter of 2022 and closed 19 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, contributing about $107 million to estimated annualized revenues in the first nine months of 2022.The recent acquisition marks the third acquisition in the first quarter of 2023. AJG’s merger and acquisition pipeline is quite strong with about $400 million of annualized revenues and associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.Arthur J. Gallagher’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations and a compelling product and service portfolio. A solid capital position supports AJG in its growth initiatives and it, thus, remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 69% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McDonald's Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$182m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

As of December, the cost of grade A large eggs per dozen was $4.25.What's behind the spike in price? The avian flu outbreak.""The total size of the U.S. egg-laying flock decreased by about 10% when roughly 40 million laying hens caught the disease and were subsequently destroyed in 2022,"" Kevin Bergquist, an analyst at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute told Yahoo Finance.As a result, the total egg production dropped by about 5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.David Anderson, professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&amp;M, said production expenses triggered record high prices, too.""Feed costs have been much higher for a couple of years now. As feed prices went up, profits went down, and the economic response to that is to produce less, so we had been producing slightly fewer egg laying chickens any way, prior to [avian flu] hitting,"" he said.Anderson added: ""A small change in supply or quantity produced generates a much larger increase in price. In other words, if the price goes up, consumers are going to buy eggs anyway, or that they will not cut back very much at all. There is really not a substitute for an egg in my egg McMuffin, or my omelette. You pretty much have to have eggs.""In addition, holiday baking led to an increase in demand, he said.Impact on retailers? As a result of supply issues, some retailers are limiting customers' egg purchases.Story continuesOn Nov. 29, Yahoo Finance spotted this sign at a BJ's Wholesale Club limiting 2 egg cartons per a customer. BJ's did not respond to a request for comment.A Whole Foods in Brooklyn recently imposed a similar limit.Taken at a BJ's Wholesale Club in New York on Nov. 29th, 2022 (Courtesy: Yahoo Finance).Other major retailers are holding off on limits.A Target (TGT) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we are experiencing low inventory of some egg products, it ultimately depends on the brand. We are not limiting guest purchases at this time.""The current average sale price of Target's private label 12 count of Good &amp; Gather conventional eggs is $4.26, a cent higher than the current national average for U.S. cities.A Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: ""While we have some regions of the country that have seen some tightness in supply, we are seeing improved supply on eggs right now and have recovered from a challenging holiday season which had very high demand and impacts due to avian flu ... We do not have any purchase limits on eggs.""When will prices go down? With the Easter Holiday around the corner, it may take a while for consumers to see relief in egg prices.""We typically see egg prices peak in the spring, especially table eggs because of Easter and Easter egg hunts. That provides a boost to egg demand and prices. That is coming up pretty soon, so that demand will likely keep egg prices high in coming months,"" Anderson said.Anderson is optimistic, though.""I do expect as we go further into 2023 that increases in production will begin to catch up to and surpass the disease losses so production will expand, we’ll get back to the 327 million or so egg layers and prices will come down,"" Anderson said.Wells Fargo's Bergquist was confident, too, saying, ""We expect a slight decline between now and Easter, when prices will likely spike again. However, we don’t anticipate a retraction back to pre-bird flu levels. If the outbreak dissipates over the next six months, flock-laying birds will slowly rebuild, increasing egg supplies and helping alleviate high egg prices in the long term. Summer egg prices are usually much lower than the holiday seasons, and that could happen again in 2023.""And per the USDA, inventory is on the rise and prices are starting to fall.""During the last week of 2022, inventory sizes started to rise, and prices fell. Going forward, wholesale prices are expected to decrease as the industry moves past the holiday season and continues rebuilding its egg-laying flocks.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Don't Ignore These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002296.html,1673532002,STORY,"['MCD', 'AZO']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. McDonald's (MCD) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.46 a share 19 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 31, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.44 Zacks Consensus Estimate, McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of 0.55%.MCD is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is AutoZone (AZO).AutoZone, which is readying to report earnings on March 7, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $21.51 a share, and AZO is 54 days out from its next earnings report.AutoZone's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.32% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.23.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MCD and AZO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

With the stock near all-time highs, the analyst believes the market appropriately recognizes PCAR as a high-quality industrial with improved through cycle margins and earnings reflecting strategic investments in next-generation products and growth in the aftermarket/parts business.The company continues to successfully manage supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, which has led to improved margins throughout 2022, said the analyst.Margins have benefited from pricing actions, favorable mix tied to next generation products and growing aftermarket as well as market share gains, added the analyst.The analyst noted that transports are facing a slowdown in macro tied to weak demand and elevated inventories.North American truck backlogs should lead to solid earnings visibility/beats through the first half of 2023 as supply chains normalize, but this is backward-looking, said the analyst.The analyst believes 2022 is peak production for Class 8 truck and see truck production moderating over the next two years tied to strength in production over the past two years and weaker macro, which transports are already experiencing.PCAR also generates 25% of sales from Europe which is at risk of demand tempering in the second half of 2023 and into 2024, the analyst remarked.The analyst also believes order trends will be a more important driver of stock performance as a better leading indicator of demand.Looking ahead, orders are expected to moderate from peak levels.

A few dollars here and there can add up and make it difficult to save or have extra funds available to set aside for your longer-term financial goals.One common fee you may be charged each month: a monthly maintenance fee for your checking account. Many checking accounts charge a monthly service fee, sometimes referred to as a monthly maintenance fee, which is a charge by your financial institution for day-to-day operations. Add this to potential overdraft fees, ATM fees, transfer fees, and more—it can take a serious toll on your balance. One way to save: a free checking account.Choosing the right checking account can be challenging, and the right account for your financial needs will depend on a few different factors.

Our top picks are available to customers across the U.S. no matter where you’re located, subject to the terms of each checking account.For our best free checking accounts, we ranked the best accounts on the following categories and weighted each category as set forth in the percentages below:Minimum balance requirement (25%): Some financial institutions require that account holders maintain a certain balance to keep their account open. We thought that a lower minimum was preferable and rated banks with lower minimum balance requirements higher.Annual percentage yield (APY) on your account balance (25%): This percentage represents the real rate of return on your balance; the higher the APY, the better.Branch and free ATM access (20%): Accounts belonging to financial institutions that have physical branches and fee-free ATMs ranked higher on our list than alternatives that were online-only or charged fees for ATM use.Mobile and online banking platforms (15%): Accounts that can be accessed and managed via online or mobile banking platforms scored higher on our list than accounts that did not have digital banking platforms.Overdraft fees (10%): Overdraft fees are charged when there isn’t enough money in your account to cover your transactions. We favored accounts with lower overdraft fees.Customer service (5%): Top picks offer customers three ways to get in contact: chat support, by phone, or even email. Among the three options, we gave phone support the most weight.We think that the best free checking accounts offer a low or zero monthly service fee, minimum balance requirements, and a lucrative APY, among other perks. We also ranked accounts with physical branches and free ATM access higher on our list. The rates, fees, and minimum balance requirements on these checking accounts are available for limited time periods, and APYs are subject to fluctuation, which could impact how much interest you earn.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Mondelez (MDLZ) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.73 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 26, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.73 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of 2.64%.MDLZ is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. General Mills (GIS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on March 22, 2023, General Mills holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.89 a share 69 days from its next quarterly update.For General Mills, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.89 is 0.09%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MDLZ and GIS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Yet, strong reliance on relationships with collaborative partners and foreign exchange headwinds are the major downsides. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past six months, QIAGEN has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 7.6% against the industry’s 3.4% fall.QIAGEN ended third-quarter 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Ongoing double-digit sales growth in the non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow are the major upsides. The company continues to see broad-based demand for QIAGEN’s solutions in molecular research and clinical testing markets globally. The raised full-year 2022 guidance for net sales and EPS indicates this growth momentum to continue.Molecular diagnostic solutions contributed about 30% to sales in the third quarter of 2022. The key driver behind the growth was QuantiFERON franchise. Sales for the QuantiFERON TB test rose 14% CER in the third quarter on double-digit gains in all regions.QIAGEN N.V. Price QIAGEN N.V. PriceQIAGEN N.V. price | QIAGEN N.V. Quote In terms of QIAstat-Dx, the company is witnessing increasing demand and new customer interest following the new CE-IVD meningitis panel launch in 2022. The addition of this panel established a strategic critical mass in terms of the menu necessary for adoption by many customers in this region.During the third quarter, the company released a new workflow leveraging the new easy-to-connect instrument with the QIAcuity digital PCR instruments for liquid biopsy applications. This workflow combines the key features of the very high-quality sample prep with an easy tool and QIAcuity's high sensitivity to handle the demands of high-volume liquid biopsy samples.In terms of placement, the company also continues to see robust demand around the world, especially given the ability of labs to use NeuMoDx to automate the processing of LDT's laboratory developments. In the PCR and Nucleic acid amplification group, the new biopharma assets for QIAcuity are well received in the market. QIAcuity systems are increasingly adopted to enhance drug safety and efficacy to leverage the higher level of sensitivity and accuracy offered by digital PCR technology.Story continuesOn the flip side, In the third quarter of 2022, on a year-over-year basis, QIAGEN’s earnings and sales both declined. The company witnessed a significant decline in COVID-19 testing demand, which led to an overall decline of about 2% at constant exchange rates over the year-ago period. The massive decline in COVID-19 product sales and severe foreign exchange headwind impacted overall performance. In the PCR Nucleic acid amplification product group, sales declined 5% CER in the reported quarter.Total debt at the end of the third quarter was much higher than the quarter-end cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments level, indicating a weak solvency position. A series of current macroeconomic issues, including supply chain disruptions, energy needs and rising inflation, continue to hamper the company’s performance. Apart from this, stiff competition from firms offering pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers persists. High exposure to risks of foreign currency movement is observed as well.QIAGEN currently markets products in more than 100 countries. In the quarter under review, revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (31% of sales) fell 11%, reportedly due to the sharp decline in COVID testing trends. Revenues from Asia-Pacific/ Japan (19% of sales) fell 17% year over year on a reported basis. Sales in China declined about 3% CER in the third quarter.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

299,1eab0c68-f972-3f7b-b79a-132ac1729d1b,BSX,2023-01-13,Here's Why You Should Retain QIAGEN (QGEN) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-qiagen-qgen-135801310.html,1673531881,STORY,"['QGEN', 'AMN', 'BSX']","[QIAGEN N.V. QGEN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, led by progress in the test menu expansion strategy. The optimism led by the robust third-quarter 2022 performance and a few strategic collaborations in the past few months are expected to contribute further.However, headwinds from QIAGEN’s reliance on commercial relationships and a stiff competitive landscape persist. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 4.4% compared to a 14.1% decline in the industry and a 17.3% fall in the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned molecular diagnostics solutions provider has a market capitalization of $11.56 billion. QIAGEN projects 17.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain a strong segmental performance. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.8%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ3 Upsides: QIAGEN ended the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The ongoing double-digit sales growth in the non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow are the major upsides.QIAGEN continues to see the broad-based demand for its solutions in molecular research and clinical testing markets globally. The raised full-year 2022 guidance for net sales and EPS indicates this growth momentum to continue.Progress in Test Menu Expansion: QIAGEN is progressing well in its testing menu expansion strategy.In December 2022, QIAGEN received FDA approval for its therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR kit (therascreen KRAS kit). The kit is approved as a companion diagnostic to support detecting non-small-cell lung cancer patients eligible for treatment with KRAZATI (adagrasib).In November 2022, QIAGEN launched the monkeypox (MPXV) test for its NeuMoDx automated polymerase chain reaction platform — NeuMoDx MPXV Test Strip — to strengthen the surveillance and research of the current outbreak in non-endemic regions.Story continuesStrategic Collaborations to Drive Growth: QIAGEN’s long-term business strategy involves entering into strategic alliances and marketing and distribution arrangements with academic, corporate and other partners relating to the development, commercialization, marketing and distribution of some of their existing and potential products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn line with its strategy, in January 2023, QGEN completed the acquisition of Verogen — a provider of next-generation sequencing technologies — to increase its position in human identification and forensics. The acquisition of Verogen fortifies QIAGEN’s position in the fast-growing field of Human ID and forensics, anchored by sample collection and preparation, genetic testing analysis and workflow automation.DownsidesReliance on Commercial Relationships: QGEN’s personalized Healthcare business comprises the formation of projects with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to co-develop companion diagnostics paired with drugs those companies either market currently or are developing for future use. The future level of sales for companion diagnostics depends on the commercial success of the related medicines for which the tests have been designed for determining their use in patients.In addition, risks remain that the company may be unable to maintain these relationships. Further, its collaborative partners may pursue or develop competing products or technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others.Competitive Headwinds: Considering QIAGEN’s huge gamut of services, the company is susceptible to competitive headwinds. It is facing increasing competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers.The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price-sensitive. Other product suppliers may have significant advantages in terms of financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, as well as experience in research and development.Estimate TrendQIAGEN has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.9% north to $2.32.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.12 billion, suggesting a 5.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

300,432f291b-7d10-3fc5-8d12-5f019ef52c75,COF,2023-01-13,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Capital One Financial and Navient,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-capital-100010589.html,1673604010,STORY,"['COF', 'NAVI', 'COF-PJ', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 13, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Capital One Financial Corp. COF and Navient Corp. NAVI.Industry: Consumer LoansLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2038317/2-consumer-loan-stocks-to-gain-despite-grim-industry-prospectsThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of muted consumer sentiments, mainly attributable to sky-high inflation, geopolitical matters and recessionary fears. This will, therefore, gradually dampen the demand for consumer loans and hamper top-line growth. Weakening asset quality as economic growth continues to slow down is a major headwind.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Hence, companies like Capital One Financial Corp. and Navient Corp. are worth considering despite industry challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments.In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsSubdued Consumer Sentiments: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply-chain disruptions and inflation (though now somewhat moderating) continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Despite this, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) increased in December. But this seems to be largely supported by “jobs, wages, and declining gas prices.”Story continuesLynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said, “The Present Situation and Expectations Indexes improved due to consumers’ more favorable view regarding the economy and jobs. Inflation expectations retreated in December to their lowest level since September 2021, with recent declines in gas prices a major impetus. Vacation intentions improved but plans to purchase homes and big-ticket appliances cooled further. This shift in consumers’ preference from big-ticket items to services will continue in 2023, as will headwinds from inflation and interest rate hikes.”Consumer spending will face headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates in the coming months. This will thereby result in lower demand for consumer loans. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be hampered.Credit Quality May Worsen: Since March 2020, the U.S. administration has provided substantial financial assistance to individuals through various packages to overcome pandemic-related challenges. However, with the stimulus packages gradually stopping and the Federal Reserve signaling continued monetary policy tightening to tame inflation, there is a strong likelihood that the U.S. economy might be slipping into a “mild” recession in the near term.Also, going by the central bank’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will grow 0.5% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024, lower than the prior projection of 1.2% for this year and 1.7% for the next. These factors may severely curtail the consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers will have to build additional reserves to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays owing to the economic slowdown. This will, thereby, lead to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it at the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a disappointing earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have moved 7.6% lower.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar despite industry headwinds, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 32.5% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have declined 17.3% and 14.7%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of price-to-tangible book (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their results from one quarter to the next, the industry currently trades at 1.06. The highest level of 1.54X and a median of 1.18X are recorded over the past five years.This compares with the S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 9.99X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.70X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio.2 Consumer Loan Stocks to Keep an Eye OnCapital One: Headquartered in McLean, VA, the company is primarily focused on consumer and commercial lending as well as deposit origination. Strength in credit card and online banking operations, decent loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion initiatives will keep supporting Capital One’s financials.With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to control inflation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s NII and NIM are expected to witness improvements. Also, its Credit Card segment is likely to continue showing strength. Strong growth opportunities in card loans and purchase volumes are expected despite an intensely competitive environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally higher for 2022 over the past 30 days. Also, COF’s shares have lost 3.5% over the past six months.Navient: This Zacks Rank #3 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology, cost control efforts and inorganic expansion strategy will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Further, the improving economy and declining unemployment rate should provide support to the company.Strengthening its asset recovery and business process outsourcing capabilities, NAVI has entered into several acquisition deals since 2015. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Its shares have rallied 17.1% over the past six months. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2022 and 2023.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.6% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $495.52 in the previous session. Ulta Beauty has gained 5.2% since the start of the year compared to the -21.9% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the -8.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on December 1, 2022, Ulta reported EPS of $5.34 versus consensus estimate of $4.09.For the current fiscal year, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $22.87 per share on $9.98 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $24.17 per share on $10.76 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.65% and 7.83%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUlta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ulta has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 14.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 21.3X versus its peer group's average of 6.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ulta currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ulta meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Ulta shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Vertex Pharmaceuticals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Vertex Pharmaceuticals grew its EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. On the revenue front, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 22% to US$8.7b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Vertex Pharmaceuticals?Story continuesAre Vertex Pharmaceuticals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$76b company like Vertex Pharmaceuticals. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$152m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Vertex Pharmaceuticals To Your Watchlist?One positive for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists.

That single transaction was for €913k worth of shares at a price of €45.89 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of €51.90. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.Coca-Cola Europacific Partners insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about €30m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). CCEP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.99. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.69. Over the past year, CCEP's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.43 and as low as 11.84, with a median of 14.62.Investors will also notice that CCEP has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CCEP's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.68. Over the past 52 weeks, CCEP's PEG has been as high as 1.59 and as low as 0.96, with a median of 1.28.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.55 indicates a change of +2.6% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.81 billion and $43.93 billion estimates indicate +10.8% and +2.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Corteva, Inc. (CTVA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.08 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2023.CTVA has an Earnings ESP figure of 33.33%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06.CTVA is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Coca-Cola (KO).Slated to report earnings on February 9, 2023, Coca-Cola holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.46 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.Coca-Cola's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.98% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45.Story continuesCTVA and KO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to skip our introduction about the industry, then take a look at 5 Biggest Natural Resources Companies in the World.Last year proved that if there’s one investment area that can be labeled as “ever green” in terms of investments, it’s the energy sector. When the entire stock market was crushed amid increasing volatility, the oil and gas industry thrived. A report from Bloomberg says that the S&amp;P 500 Energy Index companies paid out $16.4 billion in cumulative dividends in the third quarter of 2022 alone, up 15% from the second quarter of the year. The report said that these dividend payments and stock price performance of energy companies have boosted investors’ appetite for energy stocks.The natural resources industry has solid, long-term growth prospects. When there’s peace, governments around the world invest in infrastructure and welfare projects for people, increasing the demand of commodities and natural resources. When there’s war, the world goes through uncertainty and becomes hungry for oil and gas. In every situation, the demand of natural resources is bound to grow.The worldwide shift to green energy is also boosting growth prospects of natural resource companies working to harness renewable energy like solar, wind and hydropower.Our MethodologyFor this article we did a thorough research to first list down the biggest companies in the following segments of the natural resources industry:OilGasMineralsMiningForestTimberRenewable Energy (Sun, Wind)The above process gave us a large list of companies operating in all the important segments of the natural resources industry. We then chose the biggest of these companies based on market caps. Naturally, oil and gas companies were taking the most share of the list and in some cases major companies from small segments of the industry (for example: timber/forests) were unable to make it to the list.Story continuesIn those cases, we removed smaller oil and gas players and replaced them with the biggest companies from relatively small but important segments of the natural resources industry. That allowed us to give representation to every natural resource business segment in our list.The link is ranked in an ascending order of the market caps of these companies.Biggest Natural Resources Companies in the World20.

(NYSE:WM) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-32-return-equity-waste-110023878.html,1673607623,STORY,['WM'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Waste Management How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:32% = US$2.2b ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32.Does Waste Management Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Waste Management has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesWaste Management's Debt And Its 32% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Waste Management, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.91. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:IR),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-ingersoll-rand-162252876.html,1673540572,STORY,['TT'],"[How far off is Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.11bUS$1.20bUS$1.31bUS$1.45bUS$1.54bUS$1.63bUS$1.70bUS$1.76bUS$1.81bUS$1.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.76%Est @ 5.33%Est @ 4.32%Est @ 3.62%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$969US$927US$882US$837(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$23b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$56.8, the company appears about fair value at a 0.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ingersoll Rand as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.058. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Ingersoll RandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Ingersoll Rand, we've put together three essential elements you should consider:Risks: Be aware that  Ingersoll Rand is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does IR's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The airline had long cultivated a reputation for reliable customer service, humorous flight crews and low-cost flights.Southwest's board has set up a new Operations Review Committee to oversee management following last month's systems collapse, Jordan said.Asked about his job security, he said: ""I'm not focused on that one bit, and at the end of the day, that's not up to me in any case.""""There are a lot of reasons that this happened, but it's on me at the end of the day,"" Jordan said. ""It's on me to not let this happen again and to rebuild trust with our employees and rebuild trust with our customers, and we will do exactly that.""Jordan, who took the airline's helm last February, is under pressure from investors to win over customers. To mollify them, the carrier has awarded customers affected by the meltdown 25,000 Rapid Rewards points, equivalent to more than $300, as a goodwill gesture, and has also launched a fare sale.Jordan said New York-based Oliver Wyman is interviewing company staff and union members to reconstruct the recent debacle in order to identify gaps in the carrier's operations.Meanwhile, the company has put in interim measures to avoid a repeat, he said. General Electric Co is updating the company's software, which will automate its crew scheduling systems, he said.Story continuesGE said the current software Southwest uses ""performed as designed"" during the problems last month. ""We are working with them to define new functionality as they improve their crew rescheduling capability,” it said in a statement.Southwest has also put together a new team of trained employees who can be cross-utilized to manage rescheduling crew during a disruption that requires significant schedule changes. Jordan said the company activated this group during the Federal Aviation Administration nationwide ground stop on Wednesday.The airline is processing tens of thousands of customer reimbursements a day, he added. With the exception of 1% of bags, the airline has delivered to customer all the luggage that went missing.Jordan defended the airline's point-to-point business model, which allows customers to fly directly from smaller cities without having to stop and change planes at major hubs like Chicago and New York. He said last month's disruption was not due to the structure, but said the airline could set up more crew bases if Oliver Wyman recommends that.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the engineering profession, its impact on the economy and the corporate tech sector around the world and go directly to the 5 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the World. Engineering can perhaps be thought of as one of the most important human endeavors in the modern age beside science. The two fields complement each other. Scientists theorize about nature and engineers apply those theories into practical applications, making our technological world possible. So engineering is central to technological progress and the latter is crucial for economic growth in advanced economies. For instance, the correlation between Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and economic progress in advanced countries is a positive 60%, with technological growth being one of the three factors in TFP. Naturally therefore, there’s a high demand for engineers, leading them to earn handsome salary packages, which in turn, creates demand for engineering education. Engineering-Fields OutlookTraditionally, electronics and electrical engineering have dominated the overall field. However, things are slowing down, at-least at the moment, due to disrupted supply chains, resulting in materials shortage and an endemic shortage of engineers. A survey shows 76.41% of corporations are having trouble finding engineers. The shortage is mostly due to a declining interest in STEM, aging workforce and engineers moving into managerial roles. The report went on to illustrate that there has roughly been a 90% drop in electrical-engineering graduates, offset by a 90% increase in computer-science graduates over the past half a century. This has led to software engineering becoming the new hot engineering field. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that software engineers are some of the highest income-earners in the US, with an average annual salary of $131,490. In addition, the IT employment in the country is projected to grow by 21% during 2021-2031, faster than all other occupations.Story continuesAI engineers are the most in demand within the larger software-development industry and also earn higher than their regular software-engineering peers, due to the lightning-fast rate of progress in machine learning and its impact on other industries.  According to Indeed, the median salary for a machine learning engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area is nearly $170,000, significantly higher than the average income of a regular software engineer.In terms of academia, National University of Singapore, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harbin Institute of Technology are considered some of the top schools for engineering disciplines. When it comes to the corporate sector, tech giants like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are prominent when it comes to hiring electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineers.  General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is the most diverse company when it comes to electrical engineering in the US. On the software front, there are companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).The US, Japan and Germany are some of the most advanced countries in engineering. Below, we list the 12 countries that produce the best engineers in the world. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the WorldCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology For our list of the best countries in engineering, we’ve ranked them based on the averaged-out rankings from two reports -  The Global Innovation Index Report of 2021 and Scimago Journal and Country Ranks. We've picked up two sub-metrics from the two reports and averaged out the rankings based on them. We have used 'Knowledge and Technology Output' metric from the Global Innovation Index Report and H-Index for engineering papers from the Scimago Journal and Country Rank.The former accounts for technological output and the quality of technical academic knowledge required for the purpose. This gives us a useful indication of which countries have high-quality educational infrastructure for engineering.The latter, on the other hand, measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output. It lets us know which countries' engineers are leading their respective fields in R&amp;D. An H-index of 20 means that for all academic publications by an engineer, 20 of them have been cited by other researchers at-least 20 times.We’ve also discussed R&amp;D spending, whose data comes from the World Bank. In addition, we’ve mentioned top engineering universities, as well as tech companies in these countries, whose data comes from Scimago Institutions Rankings. Here are the 12 countries that produce the best engineers in the world. 12.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share. View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230113005085/en/ContactsInvestor Contact:Zack SopcakSenior Vice President952-936-7215zack.sopcak@uhg.com Media Contact:Matt StearnsSenior Vice President202-276-0085matt.stearns@uhg.com]"

Owensboro Health is expected to gain from this partnership as Optum will overlook its revenue cycle management operations and information technology services. With better operational efficiencies, the time consumed in repetitive tasks may diminish and subsequently, greater time can be devoted to interacting with patients.To complement the abovementioned endeavor, around 575 team members of Owensboro Health in the field of revenue cycle and information technology services will join the Optum team from April 2023. The team members will have access to Optum’s innovative tools, technologies, processes and skills development training opportunities, which will be of great use to Owensboro Health. Additionally, the latest collaboration reflects Optum’s intensified focus on upgrading traditional healthcare models and systems of different U.S. communities in order to better serve patients. As an example of the same, the alliance strives to offer a clear and patient-friendly billing experience throughout the targeted communities. The UnitedHealth Group unit will also make use of advanced digital technologies to modernize infrastructure across the care delivery networks of Owensboro Health.Through extending high-quality care, delving into underserved areas and offering a seamless experience for patients, physicians, nurses and other providers across western Kentucky and southern Indiana, the footprint of Optum in the regions will undoubtedly receive a boost.And tying up with Owensboro Health seems to be a prudent move on the UNH arm’s part for foraying into the two regions. Owensboro Health continues to be a leading primary and specialty care provider for western Kentucky and southern Indiana which has helped it to gain an in-depth understanding of the local communities.Story continuesTo boost the Optum business, UnitedHealth Group has frequently undertaken significant investments related to numerous acquisitions, rolling out of cutting-edge solutions, market-leading health analytics, modern care delivery and data-driven population health approaches. These investments have started bearing fruits as Optum’s prowess makes it a frequent pick by different U.S. healthcare systems to improve their organizational efficiencies.Within a few days of the beginning of 2023, the UnitedHealth Group arm entered into a strategic partnership with one of Maine’s integrated health delivery systems, Northern Light Health. The move is likely to improve Northern Light’s efficiency and equip it to extend better health outcomes for patients across the state.The Optum unit of UNH continues to perform well for quite some time, courtesy of an increase in value-based care arrangements and an extensive pharmacy care services suite. This, in turn, drives the top-line growth of the parent company UnitedHealth Group.Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained 3.9% over a year compared with the industry’s 4.2% growth.

Not a single question was asked to Peltz, the source added.""Nelson is gearing up for a fight here,"" the source said, noting Peltz may press Disney to cut expenses among other initiatives designed to boost profits and the sagging stock price.Peltz — who has run successful activist campaigns at well-known brands like P&amp;G — would also like to see the dividend Disney cut during the pandemic restored, the source said. Peltz hasn't decided if a Disney spin-off of ESPN — as Wall Street has pushed for in the past — should occur, the source added.Peltz reportedly owns about $900 million in Disney stock, and also took to criticizing Iger's compensation in a lengthy new slide-deck called ""Restore the Magic.""Iger was not made available to Yahoo Finance for an interview.Nelson Peltz founding partner of Trian Fund Management LP. speak at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Mike BlakeTo be sure, this is shaping up to be one of the uglier activist battles in recent memories — filled with big egos, big money, and a big brand.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Disney announced Nike executive chairman and former CEO Mark Parker will take over Susan Arnold's position as chairman of the board. The company also recommended shareholders vote against Peltz in his efforts to win a seat on the company's board.""While senior leadership of The Walt Disney Company and its Board of Directors have engaged with Mr. Peltz numerous times over the last few months, the Board does not endorse the Trian Group nominee, and recommends that shareholders not support its nominee, and instead vote FOR all the Company’s nominees (noted above),"" Disney wrote in a news release.A source tells Yahoo Finance Peltz was not offered a board observer role as had been previously reported by other media outfits. Instead, the source says Peltz was offered information sharing under a non-disclosure agreement, and an opportunity to meet with management and the board quarterly.According to Thursday's statement, Peltz had expressed interest in joining Disney's board as early as July and had multiple conversations with former Disney CEO Bob Chapek before picking up discussions with Iger on Nov. 23 — three days after he was re-appointed to the executive position.During that November meeting, Trian representatives reportedly emphasized they did not want to engage in a lengthy and costly proxy fight, and voiced support over Iger's return.At that time, Disney raised the idea of a mutually agreed upon independent director being added to the Board, but Trian doubled down that representation by a Trian partner was intended ""to foster an ownership mentality in the boardroom"" and ""stimulate additional discussion among Disney directors regarding the challenges faced by the Company,"" the statement revealed.Executive Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger arrives at the world premiere for the film 'The King's Man' at Leicester Square in London, Britain December 6, 2021.

335,4a3e2add-2c30-318c-8c78-d7f16c7cb6af,PG,2023-01-13,Earnings Preview: Procter & Gamble (PG) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-procter-gamble-pg-150003928.html,1673535603,STORY,['PG'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.4%.Revenues are expected to be $20.57 billion, down 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P&amp;G?For P&amp;G, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P&amp;G will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P&amp;G would post earnings of $1.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of +1.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P&amp;G doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

336,85bc50d2-f108-3fde-90e1-7a656b442ba6,PG,2023-01-13,Investors Heavily Search Procter & Gamble Company The (PG): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-procter-gamble-140002345.html,1673532002,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share, indicating a change of -5.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of +0.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.24 indicates a change of +7% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $20.57 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.8%. The $79.6 billion and $82.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.7% and +3.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.57 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +1.29%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 14.9% gain over the past four weeks.The uptick was due to the bullish guidance given by the management for the fourth quarter of 2022. With air-travel demand bouncing back very strongly from the pandemic lows, AAL expects fourth-quarter 2022 revenues to increase in the 16-17% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. The earlier guidance hand hinted at an increase in the 11-13% range. Total revenue per available seat miles are now expected to increase roughly 24% in fourth-quarter 2022 from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. The earlier guidance had called for a 18-20% increase. Driven by the upbeat air-travel demand, AAL  now expects fourth-quarter 2022 earnings in the $1.12-$1.17 per share band. The earlier guidance was in the 50-70 cents per share range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 60 cents.This world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +142.3%. Revenues are expected to be $12.72 billion, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For American Airlines, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 86.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on AAL going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Jinko Solar JKS, American Airlines AAL and Exact Sciences EXAS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 Top Stocks Already Up More than +20% in 2023The market has started 2023 off on the right foot, with many stocks finding buyers year-to-date.While we’ve flipped the calendar to a fresh year, the forces that negatively impacted the market in 2022 remain at the forefront of investors’ concerns, namely the Fed’s pivot to a hawkish nature in an attempt to cool down inflation.And this morning, we received the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) print, which revealed that the index rose 6.5% in December on a year-over-year basis. Further, Core CPI (which doesn’t include energy and food prices) climbed 5.7% year-over-year, precisely in line with estimates.While the market digests the news, several stocks – Jinko Solar, American Airlines and Exact Sciences – have entirely ignored the market’s concerns, going on remarkably strong runs so far in 2023.All three have enjoyed strong price action year-to-date. In addition, all three have seen their near-term earnings outlooks drift higher, providing the fuel needed to continue climbing.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Jinko SolarJinko Solar is a widely famous solar technology company with its business covering the core links of the photovoltaic industry chain.Analysts have upped their earnings estimates for the company’s current and next fiscal year, helping land JKS into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company’s valuation multiples aren’t stretched; JKS shares currently trade at a 9.4X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 12.2X five-year median and the Zacks Energy – Alternate Sources industry average of 20.4X.Story continuesJinko Solar carries a Style Score of “A” for Value.Growth is more than apparent, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $3.70 for its current fiscal year (FY22) suggesting an improvement of more than 115% Y/Y. And in FY23, estimates indicate a further 93% of earnings growth.American AirlinesAmerican Airlines, the largest airline internationally, provides passenger and cargo services. Currently, the company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AAL has seen its earnings outlook drift higher across all timeframes over the last several months.American Airlines is forecasted to make an extensive recovery; estimates for its current fiscal year indicate a sizable 98% uptick in earnings Y/Y.Looking ahead to FY23, AAL’s bottom line is expected to hit the green again.In addition, the company has primarily posted better-than-expected quarterly results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in three of its last four releases.In its latest print, AAL registered an impressive 28% EPS beat and reported sales marginally above expectations.Exact Sciences Corp.Exact Sciences is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer.Like the stocks above, analysts have raised their earnings estimates as of late, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A strong earnings report has shares up more than 100% over the last three months. EXAS penciled in a 23% EPS beat and reported revenue roughly 5% ahead of expectations.Bottom LineWhile inflation remains the market’s primary concern, stocks have gotten off to a solid start in 2023, with investors hoping that a more prosperous year is on the horizon.And all three stocks above – Jinko Solar, American Airlines and Exact Sciences – have started the new year strong, all up more than 20% year-to-date.In addition, all three have witnessed their earnings outlooks drift higher as of late, providing the fuel needed for the runs to continue.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

BCC, Thor Industries THO and Caleres CAL.5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Rely On Amid Market ChaosYear 2022 was marked by extreme turbulence and volatility. To combat the sky-high inflation, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance and raised interest rates multiple times during the course of the year. Despite moderating a little bit, inflation remains high in the United States.  Consequently, further rate hikes in 2023 are likely.The sky-high inflation apart, uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, particularly in China, are further concerns. Despite the uncertainty, shunning equities is not an advisable option. We believe that investors should include broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines, Cleveland-Cliffs, Boise Cascade Co., Thor Industries and Caleres in their watchlist.Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them. They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors.  To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Consequently, the opinion of brokers should act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Movement of Earnings Estimates: A Solid PointerSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage minutely, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock.Given the expertise and know-how of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons — favorable earnings performance, bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Story continuesTo take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Ignore the Top Line at Your PerilTo design a winning strategy, it is not wise to consider only the bottom line only. In fact, according to some market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than mere earnings beat under some circumstances. Therefore, to make our strategy full-proof, one needs to address top-line concerns as well. We have considered the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric, for screening stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 13.1% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2  (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 54% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Boise Cascade: Based in Boise, ID, BCC makes wood products and distributes building materials in the United States as well as Canada. Boise Cascade’s Building Materials Distribution and Wood Products segments are gaining strength from strong end-product demand as well as higher commodity product prices. It has also been increasing commodity offerings that will instill growth in the existing markets, underserved markets and across its entire national footprint.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 0.8% upward. BCC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Thor Industries is benefiting from its growth by acquisition strategy. The buyout of Germany-based EHG made Thor the largest recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer in the world. Its cash flow generating ability also bodes well.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 0.8% upward. THO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Caleres is a leading footwear retailer and wholesaler in the United States, China, Canada and Guam. The company operates through Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments. This Saint Louis, MO-based company has been benefiting from the positive consumer demand trends and accelerated recovery in the footwear marketplace, aiding its sales.The momentum in the Famous Footwear brand is expected to contribute meaningfully to sales growth. Strong performances of CAL’s emerging brands, including Vionic, Sam Edelman, Allen Edmonds and Blowfish Malibu, are expected to be growth drivers. Caleres has an excellent surprise history with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 26% CAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Let's take a look at some of today's huge movers. We got to talk about Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. And look at this today, a jump of just about 51%. This comes on the heels of what the stock has been doing pretty much all week, looking at the fact that it's back above 5 bucks a share. Now this comes at the time that you would have thought that the struggling retailer would have filed for bankruptcy up until this point.But instead, the stock is rallying despite reporting weaker than expected earnings earlier this week. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stock is now up more than 200% on the week, as meme traders once again flock to this name. And taking a look at that four-day performance since Monday, you're looking at gains of over 300%, actually, on our chart here with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Dave, back above 5 bucks-- I don't know.DAVE BRIGGS: Trying to find reason and accountability here is just not going to happen. There is no comeback in sight for them. It is just a matter of when, not if, they file. They're going to close 150 stores. It is good night. It is throwing your money and lighting it on fire. But looking at the percent of float shorted, it's still about half, about 50% short on Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Say goodbye.SEANA SMITH: Say goodbye. You got to be willing to, I guess, lose it all, to say the least. All right, let's talk about Cleveland-Cliffs because that stock up just about 8.6 this afternoon. The steel producer shares popping after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight. Price target of 26 bucks, about 6 bucks higher from where it is today. Now the company citing higher annual fixed price contracts, which should help the company cope with potentially lower spot steel prices.So, again, that stock moving to the upside today, back above 20 bucks a share. And let's take a look at some of the travel names. Look no further than the airlines. Certainly, a huge mover here this afternoon. The biggest mover of them all is American Airlines. And that coming up just nearly a 10% pop, boosting its EPS guidance, noting revenue should be up nearly 20% from pre-pandemic levels. The rest of the airlines rising on this news. We will be getting earnings from Delta tomorrow ahead of the bell.Now that, of course, will be a name to keep in mind. The Street is expecting earnings per share of $1.30, revenue of 12.22 billion. And taking a look at today's gains, American Airline up nearly 10%. And Dave, you also have United up, one of the huge gainers as well. Delta in the green, most of the travel stocks in the green today.DAVE BRIGGS: Only three things-- eggs, fuel, butter-- has had a higher increase over the last 12 months than airfares. Airfares up 28 and 1/2% year over year, and we are not stopping traveling fueling those numbers. Let's get to your closing bell on Wall Street for Thursday.]"

""Our investments and operational expertise allow us to provide clean, safe, and reliable service that consistently meets or surpasses state and federal regulations for protecting human health and the environment.""Planned investments are aimed at maintaining and improving system reliability, resiliency, and water quality. A few of the projects planned for 2023 include:St. Louis – Construction will begin on a new water intake pump station at the South PlantJefferson City – Construction will begin on a filter building at the water treatment plantSt. Joseph – Upgrades will be made to the Farron Booster StationJoplin – Construction of the new high-service pump station will be completed, and upgrades will be made to chemical feed equipmentAdditionally, approximately 80 miles of pipe will be replaced in operations throughout the state. Many water and wastewater pipes were originally installed 50-100 years ago. Pipes can leak and break over time due to age, soil corrosion, cold water temperatures, and ground shifting. Proactively replacing them is safer, more convenient, and more cost-effective for customers than repairing emergency breaks that can interrupt water service and cause extensive property damage.

If you want to skip our introduction about the industry, then take a look at 5 Biggest Natural Resources Companies in the World.Last year proved that if there’s one investment area that can be labeled as “ever green” in terms of investments, it’s the energy sector. When the entire stock market was crushed amid increasing volatility, the oil and gas industry thrived. A report from Bloomberg says that the S&amp;P 500 Energy Index companies paid out $16.4 billion in cumulative dividends in the third quarter of 2022 alone, up 15% from the second quarter of the year. The report said that these dividend payments and stock price performance of energy companies have boosted investors’ appetite for energy stocks.The natural resources industry has solid, long-term growth prospects. When there’s peace, governments around the world invest in infrastructure and welfare projects for people, increasing the demand of commodities and natural resources. When there’s war, the world goes through uncertainty and becomes hungry for oil and gas. In every situation, the demand of natural resources is bound to grow.The worldwide shift to green energy is also boosting growth prospects of natural resource companies working to harness renewable energy like solar, wind and hydropower.Our MethodologyFor this article we did a thorough research to first list down the biggest companies in the following segments of the natural resources industry:OilGasMineralsMiningForestTimberRenewable Energy (Sun, Wind)The above process gave us a large list of companies operating in all the important segments of the natural resources industry. We then chose the biggest of these companies based on market caps. Naturally, oil and gas companies were taking the most share of the list and in some cases major companies from small segments of the industry (for example: timber/forests) were unable to make it to the list.Story continuesIn those cases, we removed smaller oil and gas players and replaced them with the biggest companies from relatively small but important segments of the natural resources industry. That allowed us to give representation to every natural resource business segment in our list.The link is ranked in an ascending order of the market caps of these companies.Biggest Natural Resources Companies in the World20.

(NYSE:FCX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Seeing better opportunities elsewhere in the materials sector, we exited our position in Ecolab and added to copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), which supplies a much-needed resource for the energy transition, and specialty chemical company Linde (LIN), which has historically held onto pricing gains it has achieved following increases in energy costs.

""Arnold is in that group and easily among the nation's best. He has the kind of skill set that should make every Oklahoma fan very excited, and it wouldn't shock us if he sees the field sooner than later. He has a live, accurate arm and can put the ball anywhere he wants. He's also a very capable runner and can stress a defense with his arm or his legs. He's a tough kid who will stand in and take a shot and never shies away from contact. He's also a natural leader—a winner. And when you combine his on-the-field prowess with his high-end academic background, he is a very deserving choice for this honor.""Story continuesPenn State running back and 2021-2022 Gatorade National Player of the Year Nick Singleton added: ""Winning the Gatorade National Football Player of the Year last year meant the world to me as a high school athlete and student, and I'm thrilled to welcome Jackson to the Gatorade Player of the Year Family.""The 6-foot-1, 205-pound senior quarterback led the Wildcats to a 14-1 record and a berth in the 6A-Division II semifinals.

352,321ec8a3-3574-3c8c-8bcb-bd6465ec51d3,UNP,2023-01-13,Does Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-union-pacific-nyse-unp-110027661.html,1673607627,STORY,['UNP'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Much Debt Does Union Pacific Carry?As you can see below, at the end of September 2022, Union Pacific had US$33.2b of debt, up from US$29.0b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.31b, its net debt is less, at about US$31.8b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Union Pacific's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Union Pacific had liabilities of US$5.71b due within a year, and liabilities of US$47.9b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.31b as well as receivables valued at US$2.05b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$50.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Union Pacific has a very large market capitalization of US$138.0b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Union Pacific has net debt to EBITDA of 2.6 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. But the high interest coverage of 8.2 suggests it can easily service that debt. One way Union Pacific could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 12%, as it did over the last year. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Union Pacific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Union Pacific recorded free cash flow worth 65% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThe good news is that Union Pacific's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its net debt to EBITDA does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Union Pacific can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Union Pacific , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

Martin reiterated a Buy rating on the shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) and raised the price target from $255 to $270.The analyst has trimmed the Q4 EPS estimate from $2.68 to $2.61 as an increase in RPU assumption isn’t fully able to offset weaker volumes and higher expenses.Based on AAR data, the analyst estimates UNP’s carloads were down ~3% y/y in Q4 compared to the prior assumption of flat.On a segment-by-segment basis, the analyst estimates metals &amp; minerals (+15%), coal &amp; renewables (+14%), fertilizer (+9%), and forest (+8%) led the way.The analyst said that more than offset these gains were declines in premium segment volumes, including an estimated 15% drop in autos as the chip shortage persists and a 12% decrease in intermodal traffic.As for RPU, the analyst now models 12% y/y growth versus 9% previously on favorable pricing, fuel surcharge, and elevated assessorial charges.On the expense side, the analyst models a slight increase in average headcount based on STB data.The analyst now assumes full-year volume is up 4%, in line with UNP’s target that was revised down last month from 5% to about 4% growth.The analyst believes UNP remains well positioned to achieve its 55.x% full-year 2022 OR target as demand remains strong and supply chain congestion gradually improves.The analyst expects the company will likely provide more specific guidance when it reports Q4 results.Price Action: UNP shares are trading higher by 0.02% at $214.30 on the last check Thursday.Photo Via CompanyLatest Ratings for UNPDateFirmActionFromToJan 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsBuyJan 2022SusquehannaMaintainsPositiveJan 2022Raymond JamesMaintainsStrong BuyView More Analyst Ratings for UNPView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!
