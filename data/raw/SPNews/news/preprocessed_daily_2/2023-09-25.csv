They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab, and has been able to amass over $10.77 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the World ETFs. FNDF seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Co. Index (Net) before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the companies included in the Russell Developed ex-U.S. Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.10%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Shell Plc (SHEL) accounts for about 2.36% of the fund's total assets, followed by Samsung Electronics Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp.The top 10 holdings account for about 7.16% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF return is roughly 12.32% and is up about 24.33% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/25/2023), respectively. FNDF has traded between $25.15 and $33.54 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.88 and standard deviation of 17.35% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 949 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $56.77 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $110.36 billion.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor What Is Nucor's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Nucor had debt of US$6.83b at the end of July 2023, a reduction from US$7.54b over a year. However, it does have US$5.38b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$1.45b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Nucor's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Nucor had liabilities of US$4.00b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$8.43b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$5.38b and US$3.87b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$3.18b.Of course, Nucor has a titanic market capitalization of US$38.1b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Nucor's net debt is only 0.16 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 90.3 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. In fact Nucor's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 39% in the last twelve months. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Nucor can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Nucor recorded free cash flow worth 64% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewBased on what we've seen Nucor is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Nucor is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

10,bbecbe01-b7ae-3adf-b541-5afdb89ae5c1,TMO,2023-09-25,"‘Load Up,’ Says Morgan Stanley About These 3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/load-says-morgan-stanley-3-231010339.html,1695597010,STORY,"['MS', 'TMO', 'HWM', 'ZTS']","[Investors have been buoyed this year by the fact that a mooted recession has failed to materialize. However, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, says that it does not mean the prospect of one taking place has completely evaporated.“While the investor sentiment pendulum on a recession arriving in 2023 has swung from roughly ’70/30′ to ’30/70′ over the past 6 months based on our dialogue, there is more debate on whether we have avoided it altogether – i.e., soft/no landing, or if it’s just been pushed out to 2024,” Wilson recently said,Given the uncertainty about what’s coming next, Wilson expects the market to trade in a “late cycle” manner and he recommends a way to deal with such an environment. “In our view,” says the strategist, “the best way to express that in a portfolio is to hold a barbell of defensive growth (select growth stories and more traditional defensive sectors like Healthcare and Consumer Staples) with late-cycle cyclicals.”Taking that advice to heart, the analysts at Morgan Stanley have been busy pointing out stocks with such attributes and ones they believe investors should be loading up on right now.We ran 3 of their picks through the TipRanks database to find out whether the rest of the Street is comfortable with these choices. Turns out they certainly are; all are currently rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s see why they are drawing plaudits across the board.Howmet Aerospace (HWM)The first Morgan Stanley pick we’ll look at certainly has the defensive credentials to deal with uncertain times. Howmet Aerospace is a global leader in advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and defense (A&amp;D) industries. Formerly known as Arconic, the company rebranded as Howmet Aerospace in 2020 following a separation from its parent company. With a rich history dating back to the early days of aviation, Howmet Aerospace is an established provider of high-performance materials and precision-engineered components that play a critical role in the functioning of modern aircraft and defense systems.Story continuesStrong demand for jet parts on account of plane makers ramping up production activities saw Howmet raise its full-year profit and revenue outlook when the company reported Q2 earnings in early August. Howmet called for 2023 revenue between $6.40 billion and $6.47 billion, up from the prior $6.20 billion to $6.33 billion range. Adj. EPS was increased from between $1.65 to $1.70 per share to between $1.69 and $1.71.The new forecasts came off the back of a strong quarterly performance. Revenue reached $1.65 billion, amounting to an 18.7% year-over-year increase while beating the consensus estimate by $40 million. Adj. EPS of $0.44 edged ahead of the Street’s call by $0.01.After paying a visit to the company’s Michigan-based Whitehall Plant, it’s clear to Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag why Howmet is a leader in its field – a situation she does not see changing any time soon and that is good news for investors.“The company’s investment in technology and automation underscores how it was able to take market share, increase price, and expand margins,” Liwag said. “We continue to expect operating performance to be a meaningful differentiator in monetizing the aerospace upcycle. What we saw from our visit is that Howmet has invested in cutting edge technologies and automation in its manufacturing processes to deliver on customer requirements. Additionally, the company continues to invest to support future growth. Its strength in operations also provides upside to long-term margins for shareholders. We continue to see Howmet as our Top Pick in Aerospace.”These comments underpin Liwag’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on HWM, while her $60 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 31%. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here)That thesis gets the backing of most of Liwag’s colleagues. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 11 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. Going by the $54.31 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for ~19% premium. (See HWM stock forecast)Thermo Fisher (TMO)The second pick from Morgan Stanley brings us to Thermo Fisher, a global leader in scientific research and laboratory equipment. This giant with a $194 billion market cap serves a wide range of industries and sectors and is one of the world’s largest and most influential providers of scientific solutions. Thermo Fisher’s extensive portfolio includes instruments, reagents, consumables, software, and services designed to support research, diagnostics, and manufacturing processes in fields such as life sciences, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, environmental monitoring, and more.Despite its size and global reach, the macro environment has blighted its recent performance and the company missed expectations on both the top-and bottom-line in Q2. Revenue fell by 2.6% YoY to $10.69 billion, missing the analysts’ forecast by $310 million. Adj. EPS of $5.15 also fell short of the consensus estimate – by $0.28.The outlook was not much to shout about either. The company lowered its forecast for the year, now seeing $43.4–$44.0 billion in revenue (down from the prior $45.3 billion) and adj. EPS of $22.28–$22.72 (vs. $23.70 before), both also below consensus.The lackluster quarterly results have mirrored the stock’s performance this year and the shares are down by 9% year-to-date. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Tejas Savant argues the bottom might just be in, making this health colossus worthy of investors’ consideration.“In the near-term, we continue to feel confident in TMO’s ability to deliver above market growth relative to peers when factoring in macro conditions and view the reduced ’23 outlook as achievable with room for further upside should we see a strong year-end budget flush or a faster recovery in China,” Savant explained. “Moreover, with investor sentiment in Tools now appearing to have bottomed, we see the reset (not just in 2H23 but also in 2024 estimates) as making the stock ‘ownable’ again.”“Longer term, we continue to believe that TMO is among the best positioned across the sector to drive above -peer/-market growth, given the combination of a resilient and diversified business model, strong operational track record, best-in-class mgmt team (that has demonstrated consistent all-weather execution), increasing exposure to high-growth verticals within their ~$225B TAM, and embedded capital deployment optionality,” Savant went on to add.Accordingly, Savant rates TMO shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy), backed by a $640 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 27% from current levels. (To watch Savant’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on TMO shares. 11 Buys and 1 Sell issued over the previous three months make the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $627.50 average price target suggests ~25% upside from current levels. (See TMO stock forecast)Zoetis Inc. (ZTS)For our final Morgan Stanley selection, we’ll remain within the realm of healthcare, albeit in a unique niche. With a market cap over $81 billion, Zoetis is a leading global animal health firm dedicated to improving the health and well-being of animals. Founded in 1952 as a subsidiary of Pfizer, Zoetis became an independent company in 2013, and operates in more than 100 countries.The company specializes in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a wide range of veterinary medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and other products essential for the care and welfare of animals and serves a customer base that includes veterinarians, livestock producers, and pet owners.The latest Q2 report delivered solid results on all fronts. Revenue surged by 4.8% year-over-year, reaching $2.2 billion, which exceeded expectations by $40 million. Additionally, the adj. EPS of $1.41 trumped the $1.31 forecast.The beats were accompanied by a mixed outlook. Full-year revenue is expected in the range of $8.50 billion to $8.65 billion, down from the range between $8.58 billion to $8.73 billion, although it still stuck to its operational revenue growth target. The profitability profile, on the other hand, got a boost. The company now anticipates full-year adj. EPS between $5.37 to $5.47 per share vs. $5.34 to $5.44 per share beforehand.Looking at Zoetis’ prospects, Morgan Stanley analyst Erin Wright thinks the company is moving in the right direction and believes it is not given the respect it deserves.“While the latest print had several moving pieces, it was still somewhat cleaner than its recent reports, and it encouragingly reaffirmed its operational growth guide, suggesting strengthening trends for the balance of the year,” the 5-star analyst commented. “We continue to view the unmatched breadth of ZTS’ portfolio as significantly underappreciated, with continuing innovation expected to further distinguish ZTS from competitors with over 300 projects in its R&amp;D pipeline and with new products enhancing its exposure to faster-growing, more profitable categories.”Quantifying this stance, Wright rates Zoetis shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) with a $248 price target, implying shares will post growth of 40% in the months ahead. (To watch Wright’s track record, click here)Overall, the analysts are all behind this one; Zoetis gets a full house of Buys – 8, in total – all naturally coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are expected to appreciate by 26% over the course of the year, considering the average target stands at $223.25.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

Russia is subject to a $60-a-barrel price cap.Russia has shipped half of its seaborne crude without Western insurance this Spring — meaning it may be selling at higher prices, per the FT.Oil prices are nearing $100 a barrel, throwing a spanner into the US Federal Reserve's fight against inflation — but at least one party would be rejoicing: Russia.Oil prices have gained recently on the back of supply cuts from major energy producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.The production cuts have sent oil prices up over 10% so far this year and are likely benefiting Russia and its war chest, according to a Financial Times analysis of shipping and insurance records, the outlet reported on Sunday.The FT's analysis showed that almost three-quarters of all seaborne Russian crude oil exported out of the country managed to get shipped without Western insurance in August. That's up from about 50% in the Spring, the FT reported, citing data from data firm Kpler and insurance companies.Russia's side-stepping the use of Western insurance for its oil exports is an important development because it's one of the key tools used to enforce a G7-led $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian oil. The price cap is part of sweeping sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.Russia's ability to ship so much crude without Western insurance suggests it may now be able to sell crude over the price cap, per the FT analysis.And higher oil prices have boosted Russia's energy export revenues. The Kremlin raised $17.1 billion from its crude exports in August — up from $15.3 billion in July, data from the International Energy Agency showed.In fact, Russia could have made over one billion dollars just by hiking its oil shipping costs — even though it was still selling crude to India below the $60-a-barrel price cap, according to a separate FT analysis in August.Story continuesDespite sweeping sanctions, Russia's wartime economy is getting a boost from defense and government spending, the New York Times reported in July.Higher oil prices are bad news for the world's central banks, which have been trying to tame high inflation since last year. Energy is a key input for economic activities, so higher oil prices generally lead to inflation.US West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil futures were up 0.1% at $90.13 a barrel and $93.38 a barrel, respectively, at 11.34 p.m. ET on Sunday.Russia's energy ministry and Kpler did not immediately respond to requests from Insider for comment sent outside regular business hours.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

We will also be looking at the current market conditions and some of the big players in this industry while covering the major fuel exporting countries in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Fuel Exporting Countries in the World.The Fuel Industry: An OverviewFuel, as a source of energy, powers the world. The fuel industry is diverse, ranging from fossil fuels such as crude oil and natural gas to solid fuels namely wood and coal. While upstream companies in the fuel industry generate cash flows from extracting oil and gas from reserves, downstream beneficiaries of oil and gas production include refineries that remove impurities from crude oil to convert it into gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, and others. Oil and gas reserves around the world are declared proven if there is a 90% or greater certainty of them being present and economically viable for extraction.Current Market ConditionsAccording to an outlook of the oil and gas industry for 2023, Deloitte reported that issues such as supply chain disruptions and fluctuation in oil prices have been common. Oil and gas companies have also been resorting to cleaner energy sources. There has also been a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas.In September, the International Energy Agency reported an analysis of the global oil market for different regions around the world. In August, the Russian oil exports declined but the revenues from these exports rose due to high prices. China and India accounted for the majority of Russian oil exports. The oil supplies from Saudi Arabia also reduced which is further expected to create a market deficit in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the IEA.On September 7, Reuters reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia have further announced to extend their supply cuts till the end of 2023. The higher oil prices resulting from this tight supply are interwoven with global politics as the US believes that Russia needs to be prevented from earning higher revenues from rising oil prices which it uses to fund the Ukrainian war. While the European Union has imposed caps on Russian exports of oil, oil continues to be traded at higher prices.Story continuesA Competitive LandscapeThe oil and gas industry is saturated with different incumbents who continue to strive for their market positions. Some of these include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil and gas companies both in terms of market value and production. The company is vertically integrated across the oil and gas industry and also serves to be a significant global oil refiner. On August 28, Reuters reported that the company has extended its carbon capture joint development partnership with FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) till March 2024. FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) is a leading manufacturer and distributor of fuel cell energy platforms. FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) has been helping the firm through its carbonate fuel cells which reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power generation process. Another recent development by the company is the startup of two new chemical production units at its Baytown facility. On September 19, the company reported that this $2 billion expansion was aimed to fulfill the rising demand for high-value products in the market. The company has also entered the linear alpha olefins market through its new unit which will produce 350,000 tons of branded products under the name Elevexx, the company’s new linear alpha olefins-producing subsidiary.Another leader in the oil and gas industry is Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The company engages in the exploration, production, and refining of hydrocarbons. It is also one of the largest oil companies in the United States, by revenue. On September 8, the company’s Australian LNG plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone, which supply more than 5% of the global LNG, became subjected to labor strikes. On September 22, Reuters reported that full production at the company's facilities had resumed as the company agreed to resolve all outstanding issues of the workers. The Offshore Alliance representing Chevron Corporation’s (NYSE:CVX) worker unions, called off strikes after accepting a deal from Australia’s Fair Work Commission. However, the details of the agreement have not yet been publicly disclosed.Shell plc (NYSE:RDS) is a leading British multinational oil and gas company. On September 22, Reuters reported that the company entered into an agreement with Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company to supply it with natural gas till 2036. The company will be supplying a minimum of 150 million cubic feet per day of gas to Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company from the Manatee offshore field which is shared by Trinidad and Venezuela and is expected to supply gas from 2028. This agreement will also support Trinidad and Tobago with its petrochemical and power sectors which are subject to gas shortages and reduced refining capacities currently.Now that we have taken a look at the global fuel industry and what the major players such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) are up to, we can examine the 34 fuel exporting countries in the world.34 Fuel Exporting Countries in the WorldCopyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to compile a list of the 34 fuel exporting economies in the world, we sourced data from the UN World Economic Situation and Prospects report from 2023. We referred to the fuel exporting countries in this report. These countries belong to developed, developing, and in-transit economies in the world.We have used the percentage of fuel exports in total exports as our metric for identifying every fuel exporting country. These percentages have been extracted from the country profiles listed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). According to UNCTAD, a country is considered a fuel exporter if its fuel exports account for greater than 20% of its total merchandise exports where the fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas. This criteria was the rationale behind our metric for this research.Thus, we have ranked the 34 fuel exporting countries in the world in ascending order of their fuel exports as a percentage of the total exports.34 Fuel Exporting Countries in the World:34.

24,2acf3597-d30f-3617-ac8f-d1a3a2713402,O,2023-09-25,Oil prices have risen. That's making gas more expensive for US drivers and helping Russia's war,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-risen-thats-making-091958886.html,1695633598,STORY,['CL=F'],"[FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Oil prices have risen, meaning drivers are paying more for gasoline and truckers and farmers more for diesel.The increase also complicates the global fight against inflation and feeds Russia's war chest. That poses problems for politicians as well as the people having to spend more to get to work, transport the world's goods or harvest fields.Here are things to know about the recent increase — and where prices might be going:WHY HAVE OIL PRICES RISEN?Above all, Saudi Arabia's decision to cut back how much oil it sends to global markets has pushed prices higher.The world's second-largest oil supplier has slashed production by 1 million barrels a day since July and decided this month to extend the cut through the end of the year.Russia, Saudi Arabia's ally in the OPEC+ oil producers' coalition, also extended its own cut of 300,000 barrels a month through 2023.Simply, tighter supply means higher prices.International benchmark Brent oil traded at just under $94 per barrel Monday, up from $90 before the extension on Sept. 5 and from $74 before the Saudi cut was first announced. U.S. oil traded at around $90.50, up from $68 before the Saudi cut.HOW HIGH COULD OIL PRICES GO?Some analysts think oil could hit $100 a barrel based on robust demand and limited supply. But that's far from the only view.Oil prices can be volatile, and while they might briefly top $100 in the coming months, they're unlikely to stay there, said Jorge Leon, senior vice president for oil markets at Rystad Energy. He foresees prices in the low $90s on average in the last three months of the year.That's still high historically, he said, supported by “resilient” demand for fuel to drive and fly.The Saudi cuts were a unilateral move outside the framework of the OPEC+ alliance, meaning the kingdom can make changes as needed to quickly respond to shifting market conditions.Leon said the Saudis will review the cuts each month — and could add barrels back if prices spike to levels that could seriously worsen inflation in countries buying oil. Excessive price increases could mean central banks worldwide hike interest rates further or keep them higher for longer.Story continues“I don't think it will be clever for the Saudis to push that hard,” Leon said. “The last thing you want to do is fuel inflation again with much higher oil prices. That's going to kill economic growth, and lower growth is going to mean lower oil demand at the end of the day.”WHAT OTHER FACTORS AFFECT PRICES?A big question is demand for fuel, which is picking up along with rebounding travel following the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. A robust U.S. economy increases demand for oil — and the price — while weak growth in China and Europe has the opposite effect.“We see the upside potential for the oil price as being virtually used up and if anything envisage setback potential in view of the weak economy,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, Commerzbank head of commodities research who foresees oil at $85 per barrel by year's end. “The oil price is only likely to climb more lastingly once the economic outlook begins to brighten, which should be the case next year.”Another factor is financial speculation, and it appears investors are piling into the oil market with bets that prices will rise.“Much of the price surge beyond $85 per barrel is due to a flood of speculative money, while fundamentally there is still plenty of oil in the world to meet demand for now,” said Gary Peach, oil markets analyst at Energy Intelligence.Plus, more Iranian oil may come on the market as the U.S. “turns a blind eye” on enforcing sanctions to keep prices from rising further, Leon said. That could add 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day.WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS?Costlier oil feeds through to higher prices for gasoline and diesel, especially in the U.S., where roughly half the pump price reflects the cost of crude — the rest is marketing, taxes and other costs.Crude is a smaller share of gasoline and diesel prices in Europe because fuel taxes are much higher there.Average U.S. pump prices are still well below the record $5 per gallon seen in summer 2022. But at $3.85 per gallon, they're still up 15 cents from a year ago. Oil costs are keeping gas prices high even as driving demand drops with the end of summer vacations and plentiful gasoline stocks, according to auto club AAA.Diesel prices have risen as well, along with higher oil costs and refineries facing shortages of the specific kinds of crude best for making diesel. Refineries also are choosing to produce jet fuel instead, chasing profits as air travel rebounds. A gallon of diesel cost $4.58 last week, up from $4.34 a month ago.That hurts farmers, who use a lot of diesel, and adds to the price of consumer goods transported by truck, which is pretty much everything.Diesel supplies got even tighter Friday after Russia said it would halt the export of refined oil products to hold down fuel prices at home.HOW DO HIGHER OIL PRICES HELP RUSSIA?Oil is Russia's main moneymaker, so higher prices help the Kremlin pay for its invasion of Ukraine and weather sweeping Western sanctions aimed at crushing its wartime economy.The recent rise in oil prices, along with a cutback in the discount that sanctions forced Russia to offer Asian customers, means Moscow will earn “significantly more revenue from those exports,” said Benjamin Hilgenstock, senior economist at the Kyiv School of Economics.The additional revenue could reach an estimated $17 billion this year and $33 billion next year, he said in an online talk hosted by the Brussels-based European Policy Center.Russia has lost some $100 billion in oil revenue following a European Union import ban and a $60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven major economies, which bars Western insurers and shippers from handling oil priced above that level.Russia, however, has increasingly found ways around the cap, including using a fleet of ghost tankers masking their ownership and origin of the crude they carry.Any additional export earnings help support Russia's currency and what it can import — including weapons components.WHAT ARE THE POLITICS?U.S. President Joe Biden has faced criticism from Republican lawmakers to encourage more oil drilling and scrap his support for electric vehicles.But that criticism largely overlooks the rise in U.S. oil production over the past year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that oil production averaged 12.8 million barrels a day in June, up 1 million barrels from 12 months ago, close to the levels achieved before the pandemic began in 2020.Biden has said he considers oil production essential to keep the economy going as a bridge to a future with EVs and renewable energy.Still, the White House views the oil market worldwide as being undersupplied, in line with recent OPEC data that indicates there will likely be a worldwide shortfall of 3 million barrels a day. The administration is also in touch with domestic and international producers on longtime supply needs, trying to ensure that the risk of higher oil prices does not disrupt economic growth.___Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed from Washington.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Investments for Beginners.Investors remain skeptic on the economy’s ability to completely avoid a recession. Last month equities saw a selloff driven by persistent inflation, weak jobs report and China’s economic woes. Analysts believe the Fed’s battle against inflation still has a long way to go and recession could hit the economy in the first half of 2024. Some circles however voice a lot of optimism on the back of solid state of the consumer in the US. While inflation worried some segments of the market, the bulls say the latest uptick in inflation was caused by higher energy prices. Consumer spending in the US remains strong despite the hammering households have taken due to inflation over the past several months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the “fear gauge” of the Wall Street, recently fell to its lowest point since the pandemic. VIX shows the market’s expectation of volatility based on S&amp;P 500 index options.For beginner investors with low risk appetite and limited budgets, the current market environment may seem like a chaos. Inflation storm, meme stocks, recession warnings, loads of data to process and make sense of every week and never-ending news cycle that always sound like we are an inch away from doomsday – all of this can be overwhelming and oftentimes disheartening for an average investor. But long-term investors tend to stick to their principles and ignore short-term market movements. But what if you don’t have any investing principles? After all not everyone out there is Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio. One of the best ways to get clarity in this age of volatility is to learn from the masters of the game. As Guy Spier, the legendary value investor, author of The Education of a Value Investor and manager of Aquamarine fund, says:Story continues""I read other managers’ letters. I look at the positions they own. The lists of portfolio securities that other managers own are very useful because it means the investment has already passed a very important filter. I think that whenever something in Seth Klarman’s portfolio is trading below the price that he paid for it, it is worthy of looking at, and at the same time, it performs another function. To get better at investing you want to study the moves of the masters.” Best Investments for BeginnersPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed all holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) and  Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). These two ETFs are considered ideal and safest choices for beginner investors by experts and Wall Street analysts. We sorted the holdings of these two funds by hedge fund sentiment, using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We picked 11 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. This way, we were able to pick the top investments in the stock market which are safe, less volatile and backed by smart money investors.Best Investments for Beginners11. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best investments for beginners, thanks to the company’s strong business model, diversified revenue streams and a safe dividend. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a potential breakout stock according to Wells Fargo. Recently the firm gave a list of mega-cap stocks that it believes have the potential to gain value and called them breakout stocks. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of these companies.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 111 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). The biggest stakeholder of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”10. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112While Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) might be out of the canvas in the AI race as Nvidia gets all the attention, the company has an impressive history of catching up to its competition quickly and behind the scenes AMD is launching full-throttle efforts to launch AI chips to compete with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO earlier this year landed in Taiwan to meet her team and to light a fire under the company’s AI efforts. According to media reports, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su said the high growth phase for AI will last 5-10 more years. She said that AI products market could hit $150 billion 3-5 years from now.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a long-term investment as the company slowly but surely gains market share in the AI chips industryAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The biggest stakeholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is being seen as an AI boom beneficiary as the CRM software company announced AI-related features for its CRM platform. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) also posted strong Q2 results and gave an upbeat guidance, after which several analysts praised the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives increased his price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $255.Ives wrote in a note to investors:""With the bears expecting a softer print this quarter with macro fears swirling heading into CRM earnings, Salesforce came out of the gates swinging featuring a Djokovic-like performance with a top and bottom-line beat and raise quarter driven by MuleSoft momentum and its overall subscription business further proving strength in the Beltway.”Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff, answering a question during the company’s Q2 earnings call, said the following about generative AI:“These are mostly predictive transactions, but we’re moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products, which we’ve now released to our customers. We’re very excited about the speed of our engineering organization and technology organization, our product organization and their ability to deliver customer value with generative AI.We have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we’re kind of now in a generative zone means that’s zone number two. But as you’re going to see at Dreamforce, zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven’t really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies, and that’s an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation and growth and to help our customers in all those areas. And then we’re eventually going to move into AGI and that will be the fourth area. And I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before. Because you’re going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more productivity, more capabilities, more augmentation of your employees, as I mentioned.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is generating all the buzz around the latest iPhone 15 as analysts are swooning over the company’s new products and their revenue potential. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently said in a report that iPhone 15 pre-orders are up between 10% and 12% year-over-year – as of the night of September 17, which is ""much stronger"" than Wall Street expected.""This is a clear positive for Apple with [average selling prices] set to be a major tailwind for Cupertino in this iPhone 15 cycle with our expectation of an ASP in the ~$925 range and up roughly $100 over the last 12-15 months given heavy Pro mix model shifts,"" Ives wrote in an investor note.Dan Ives has a $240 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He reiterated his forecast for 85 million iPhone unit production for this cycle.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the best investments in the stock market for beginners. Recently, Jefferies upped its price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from $460.00 to $475.00. With over a decade of dividend increases and a dominance in the payment processing industry Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a safe choice in an otherwise volatile market.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 139 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) was Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management $2.31 billion.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is enjoying gains from the resilient consumer spending, as the company’s fiscal Q3 results show. Analysts believe Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) will gain even more once the economy turns the corner and consumer spending comes back to normal after inflation pressures cool.Commenting on fiscal Q3 results, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) CEO Ryan McInerney said that “consumer spending remained resilient, driving growth in payments volume and processed transactions.”Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 171 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Visa Inc.

28,8ff648a2-c3ae-395c-934e-d321628d67d2,MSI,2023-09-25,"With 87% ownership of the shares, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/87-ownership-shares-motorola-solutions-141246255.html,1695564766,STORY,['MSI'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Motorola Solutions implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Motorola Solutions. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Motorola Solutions?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Motorola Solutions does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Motorola Solutions' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Motorola Solutions is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Motorola SolutionsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Motorola Solutions, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$150m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Motorola Solutions. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Motorola Solutions has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The global artificial intelligence industry is expected to grow to $2.03 trillion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 21.6%. The North American market dominates the industry, with a reported market size of $175.96 billion in 2022.Similarly, the cloud computing industry is also experiencing rapid growth and development. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing industry had a market size of $569.31 billion in 2022. The global cloud computing industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $2.4 trillion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. The North American Market dominates the industry, with a market size of $401.49 billion in 2022.The growth of the two industries indicates the potential the information technology sector holds for the future and explains why large companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested in offering cloud-based services years ago. On June 26, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that the company set aside $7.8 billion to invest in the expansion of data centers in Ohio by 2030. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has created 3,500 jobs in Ohio since 2015 and added $2.2 billion to the local gross domestic product in Ohio between the years 2015 to 2022.Story continuesWhy is the Tech Industry Growing in the United States?Technology demands funding and investment. Investing in the right human and natural resources is necessary to establish technologically advanced systems that are effective and efficient. The United States is at the forefront of innovation and technology primarily due to the continuous flow and investment funding from the government and large corporations.On March 13, the Biden administration announced its annual budget set aside for Research and Development (R&amp;D). According to the report, the Biden administration is set to invest $210 billion in federal R&amp;D. Of this, slightly over $100 billion will be used for applied and basic research. Other than that, the government had also set aside $2.5 billion for innovative health research and $1.4 billion for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to upgrade STEM education and train the workforce in these industries.While government funding is necessary, support from banks and large corporations is the need of the hour. On August 24, Reuters reported that HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC) is set to expand its venture debt offering to early-stage startups. This project is to be done under the supervision of the US innovation banking division of HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC). David Sabow, head of technology and healthcare at the bank's US innovation banking unit, stated:""We've been working to mobilize the broader HSBC innovation banking platform around to support companies from Series A, all the way through their journey. We're helping with the operating business, the international expansion, the financing needs, and even leveraging the broader parts of the HSBC ecosystem to connect corporates with their early-stage potential targets.""These figures explain why new startups continue to bloom in the United States. On August 15, Forbes listed some of the next billion-dollar startups that are likely to succeed. These venture-backed startups are making considerable leaps by integrating technology into their systems. One such startup is Hex Technologies. Barry McCardel, the young CEO of Hex Technologies, has raised $96 million in equity ever since its inception. The startup boasted an estimated revenue of $6 million in 2022. The company collects data about consumer behavior and then converts them into charts and graphs for further data analysis. The startup operates on a freemium business model. What differentiates this business from other companies is that the company targets a specific niche. The niche consists of people affluent in analytics but need more exposure to the complete data science skillset.Notable Names in the Tech SectorSome of the top companies leading the tech sector include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the leading companies specializing in developing new technologies and investing in research and development. On September 14, Reuters reported that the company is set to launch its new artificial intelligence software, Gemini. The conversational AI software is more than just a regular chatbot. The software will enable people to draft emails, music, lyrics, or news stories. The software is also set to be a coder's best buddy. Companies already using the Google Cloud Vertex AI service can access Gemini.Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates the tech industry. On September 18, the company reported the launch of the M365 Copilot Early Access Program in Australia. The new program allows Australian companies to test the new generative AI powerhouse. The program allows companies to streamline all their operations. Copilot is installed in all the products Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers, allowing users to easily connect with the AI and use it as their assistant. To discuss the expansion of the program, Lucy Debono, Modern Work Business Group Director, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, stated:""Business leaders within the Early Access Program see this as an opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage in their sectors and enable greater productivity in a market navigating sustained economic pressure. We want these early adopters to work closely with Microsoft to use this technology, test it within their teams, help us to improve it further, and drive great employee experiences. This is such an exciting opportunity to see how Australian companies will use this incredible new tool to fundamentally change how we work.""Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is another top leader in the tech space. On August 22, the company introduced SeamlessM4T, a multimodal AI model for speech and text translations. The model detects almost 100 languages and offers speech-to-text translation, speech-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation, and text-to-speech translation.Investment in technology and artificial intelligence is important for businesses to sustain themselves. After all, companies realize that AI is not here to take over but to assist. It is, without a doubt, true that technology and IT have been experiencing rapid growth in the United States, but many other industries and sectors are experiencing rapid output growth and employment as well. With that, let's look at the fastest-growing sectors and investment opportunities in the United States.12 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the USOur MethodologyTo come up with the fastest-growing sectors in the United States we consulted the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

33,7a75bc60-0ecf-3b19-a298-5f31100045b6,MSFT,2023-09-25,UK competition authority provisionally approves Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-competition-authority-provisionally-approves-213920517.html,1695591560,STORY,"['ATVI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL']","[The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provided provisional approval on Monday for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s restructured acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). The announcement was well-received by the UK's merger and acquisition sector, following previous approvals from the U.S. and E.U. The $68.7 billion deal, with Microsoft's offer standing at $95 per share, led to a roughly 2% increase in Activision Blizzard's stock, bringing it closer to the acquisition offer.The approval by the CMA is contingent on the transfer of cloud gaming rights to French video game publisher UbiSoft Entertainment. Over the next 15 years, Ubisoft will hold all of Activision Blizzard's cloud gaming rights, preventing Microsoft from exclusively releasing games on its Xbox Cloud. Notably, these rights include the Call of Duty brand, for which Ubisoft will compensate Microsoft with a one-time payment based on usage.Microsoft's shares remained virtually unchanged after the announcement. However, the tech giant has seen a year-to-date performance increase of 33%, surpassing both Activision Blizzard's 23% increase and broader indices.The proposed takeover could significantly boost Microsoft's growth prospects. Sales forecasts indicate a rise of 10% in fiscal 2024 to $233.80 billion for Microsoft, while Activision Blizzard sales are expected to jump 13% this year to $9.66 billion. This could potentially add nearly $10 billion in revenue to Microsoft, marking a 70% growth increase over the last five years from sales of $143.01 billion in fiscal 2020.This rate of growth would outpace Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 47% sales growth over the same period. Apple currently holds the largest market cap on U.S. stock exchanges, just ahead of Microsoft. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard has experienced a 49% increase in sales since 2019, surpassing Apple’s top-line expansion rate, suggesting a significant potential for compounded growth for Microsoft.Story continuesIn terms of earnings, Microsoft's bottom line is projected to rise 11% in FY24 and leap another 14% in FY25 to $12.42 per share. Microsoft's stock trades at 29.3X forward earnings, above the S&amp;P 500's 20.2X, but mostly on par with the computer-software industry average. Activision Blizzard's annual earnings are expected to climb 23% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 at $4.37 per share. The game developer's stock trades at a 21.9X forward earnings multiple, closer to the industry benchmark.The potential deal between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard appears promising for both parties. The long-term benefits are expected to favor Microsoft, while Activision Blizzard edges closer to its acquisition price.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The company, which Dohmke has helmed since 2021, has been collaborating with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to build a coding-specific AI chatbot called Copilot, which launched for developers in 2020.GitHub was acquired in 2018 by Microsoft (MSFT) in a stock deal valued at $7.5 billion.Yahoo Finance caught up with Dohmke to talk about AI and where it's headed, along with the economic impact he's expecting to see from the technology.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke speaks during day two of Collision 2022 at Enercare Centre in Toronto, Canada. (Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images) (Vaughn Ridley via Getty Images)You've described it as a 'high energy' time in tech. Let me guess, is it AI-related?There have been a number of moments in the AI space in the last year that have changed how people are thinking about our industry and, quite frankly, every professional worker. If you zoom out, most companies today are software companies, and, in some form, writing software is a normal part of their business, whether it's internal applications, applications that are consumer-facing, or in business contexts.The world has opened up around us, where company leaders, CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, and everyone across all titles [are] asking themselves: How can I use generative AI to make my company more productive, to change my business processes? How do we make sure we're not left behind [in] this rapid increase in productivity? ... We actually did research to show that developers [who] use Copilot are up to 55% faster. That's a massive productivity increase and probably one of the first use cases for AI, where a whole sector's workforce becomes more productive through adopting AI.What role would you say GitHub plays in the tech ecosystem, and where does AI fit into that?GitHub is now over 15 years old and was founded on the premise of building tools for developers. ... Today, the platform is the place on the internet where developers meet, collaborate, and build software together. There's the whole open-source ecosystem, millions of developers around the world that are working together to build open-source libraries, open-source operating systems, and open-source tools. If you look at commercial applications, 90% of their stack is likely composed out of open-source components.Story continuesThe question is how do we make developers more productive? How do we enable them to collaborate, build, and ultimately be happy? I have the strong belief that developers need to be happy to be creative, as writing software is a very creative process. There isn't one single answer of how to do something. There are many paths you can take.GitHub has always been looking to make developers more efficient. Is it fair to say that AI has supercharged that?It has drastically supercharged software development because of the impact that Copilot has on writing code. If you think about it, developers spend most of their day editing, so that's where value is created. ... Copilot lets them stay in that flow and lets them solve the problem much quicker.Software development is such an iterative process. It doesn't actually matter that you sometimes are getting incomplete code. I'm used to writing buggy code myself, and that's part of how this works. ... We all know these models aren't perfect. It's actually not a big deal, because the developer is in charge.I have a joke with a friend that goes something like, ""My AI will talk to your AI."" How far does all this go?At the end of the day, I think it will be the human's choice of how much AI they want to use [and] how many tools they want to use — whether you want to do the dishes manually or use the dishwasher. I'm not saying the dishwasher has AI, but it's a nice metaphor. Most kitchens now have a dishwasher because we don't consider washing the dishes with our hands [as] necessarily an activity that brings us joy.There are a lot of things where computers have made our lives better and we clearly communicate in ways that were unimaginable 30 years ago. But at the same time, I think it has added still another layer of complexity that isn't actually necessary. ... I'm incredibly optimistic that generative AI is this next big thing, similar to what the internet and the PC [were] in the '80s and '90s.Turning to the present, GitHub has seen substantial uptake among customers on Wall Street, right?We have seen tremendous uptake across all industries and especially the financial services industry. Companies like Fidelity are at the forefront of the adoption of modern software development tools. Those companies understand very well that they need to stay ahead in the competition of innovation. ... It's quite easy to move your bank account to another bank if the software experience your financial services institution provides to you is no longer state of the art.On the other side, financial services institutions also understand that software has been a big part of their journey for the last 60, 70, 80 years. In fact, many banks are talking to me about a programming language called COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language] that was invented during the Eisenhower era. ... It just works, but it's heavily regulated, so it's hard for these institutions to just leave all of this behind and translate it into a modern programming language. ... Developers call this tech debt. ... It's just a natural part of the software development lifecycle.It makes me wonder if AI will make the software development cycle shorter at all these institutions.It'll make it shorter in the sense that it takes less time to implement the same changes and features with AI. That's the polarity, if you will: Introducing AI makes you faster, building the same thing in a shorter amount of time. It will also help developers to manage and maintain all that existing code [by] looking at it, analyzing it, finding security vulnerabilities, finding mistakes.What's your take on managing AI’s risks even amid massive growth? There are two sides to this at Microsoft and GitHub. We're committed to building AI in a responsible way. We have programs around making sure the models are safe, secure, and follow ethical guidelines. So we're making sure that when we're building these tools, they follow the premises of responsible AI.Then, on the user side, we're helping users understand how to use these tools. There's a training aspect to all this, and we've also built in GitHub what's called the DevOps toolchain. ... When you write code today as a developer, there's zero chance that you can take that code and deploy it without any checks and balances. Most companies, small and large, have established processes. ... So we have already these quality gates in place that help us to leverage AI to its fullest potential, making sure that whatever mistakes that I make are caught in the DevOps process.The Microsoft store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan is shown June 4, 2018, in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)All right, a quick lightning round. As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?I always wanted to be a software developer. But if that plan failed, I would have become a physicist. I guess, I would have become a nerd no matter what.Do you have a favorite piece of science fiction? It can be a book, movie, or video game.""Story of Your Life,"" by Ted Chiang. I hear he lives in Seattle.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. The last dividend was quite comfortably covered by Starbucks' earnings, but it was a bit tighter on the cash flow front. The company is clearly earning enough to pay this type of dividend, but it is definitely focused on returning cash to shareholders, rather than growing the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 67.1% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 45% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendStarbucks Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.42 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.12. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 18% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Starbucks May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Starbucks hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years. Starbucks is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Starbucks' DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Starbucks will make a great income stock. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Starbucks (2 are concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the North America travel and tourism market, you can go directly to 5 Most European Cities in North America.Traveling for a European vacation can be expensive and not always within the budget. There are cities in North America that can offer a taste of Europe. Before we look at the 14 most European cities in North America, let’s first take a look at the thriving travel and tourism market in North America.In one of our previous articles about most luxurious hotels, we briefly discussed how the hotel industry was one of the hardest hit during the peak of COVID-19 crisis. Similarly, the travel and tourism market also faced an unprecedented challenge when travel options were shut down and countries around the world imposed lockdowns during the outbreak of the virus. However, the post pandemic travel boom is now in full swing.North America's Growing Travel Market and Key PlayersAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the North American travel and tourism market was valued at around $1.96 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% during 2022-2027, pushing the market to reach above $2.5 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. The travel and tourism industry in North America consists of revenues generated by hotels, motels, food service and restaurants, as well as passenger airlines and passenger rail. The growing trend of transformational travel, which focuses on wellness, is expected to fuel market growth in North America. In recent years, a growing number of people have started traveling with the goal of healing, balancing, and transforming their mind, body, and spirit. In search of special and unique experiences of their own, travelers are planning their own journeys that mix entertainment and relaxation.To meet the growing travel demand and increase their profitability as well as market presence, major players in the travel and tourism market are innovating to offer more convenient and affordable options to travelers. On June 27, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) announced that Booking.com, which is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings Inc.

We counted the number of times each city is listed in these sources. We also calculated the average ranking of each of these cities by adding up their rankings in each of the sources and then dividing that figure by the number of times each city's name came up.

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$100 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$94.93. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$230m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Philip Morris International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Philip Morris International insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerThe Executive Vice President of Core Services &amp; Equipment, Abdellah Merad, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$57.20 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$59.04, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 26% of Abdellah Merad's stake.Insiders in Schlumberger didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$8.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$185m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Schlumberger Insiders?Insiders sold Schlumberger shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Schlumberger is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Schlumberger. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Schlumberger you should know about.But note: Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy.

42,f17d8762-a490-3b86-8deb-ff51c1bbe3c6,SLB,2023-09-25,13 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-american-energy-stocks-183541409.html,1695580541,STORY,"['CHK', 'DVN', 'PXD', 'FANG', 'EQT', 'VLO', 'HES', 'SLB']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best American energy stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now.Energy stocks have been enjoying gains in the third quarter, thanks to a surge in oil prices that came on the back of production cuts and an overall sentiment that the US might be able to avoid a full-blown recession. Oil prices have hit their record highs this year, creating a dilemma for policy makers since a rise in oil prices contributes to inflation, which is already a major headache for central banks around the globe. If the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep inflation under control, it will have to begin another rate-hike spree, which could spook investors and could result in a slowdown in economic activity, crushing the oil markets. This double-edged sword is expected to hang over the economy for several months to come. But energy stocks have a solid market sentiment. Recently, a Wall Street Journal report quoted  Bill Fitzpatrick, managing director at Logan Capital, who said that there is no capacity to absorb any additional demand of oil and investors “need to be positioned for an extended period of higher oil prices because that’s the most likely scenario.”Among the reasons making oil stocks attractive this year is their valuation, too. Earlier this year oil stocks took a massive hit amid recession fears and production glut. Now that oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations, long-term investors are piling into the sector for share price gains and dividends. Oil companies are famous for their lucrative and consistent dividends and when times are tough and volatile, investors hardly pass on any opportunity for hefty dividend payments.The WSJ report also quoted Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of the multi-asset solutions team at Manulife Investment Management, who said that the oil industry and its recent dynamics are expected to create some “anxiety” for the energy sector.Story continuesLong-term analysts were already expecting a rally in oil stocks. For example, in December 2022, when there was a doom and gloom scenario for the economy everywhere, JPMorgan had said that Brent crude would finish 2023 at levels 20% higher than the levels seen during December 2022. JPMorgan, however, had noted that the decline in oil prices was not reflected in oil stocks at that time and urged investors that if they wanted to pile into oil stocks they should wait for a 20% to 30% pullback. Fast forward a few months and the perfect opportunity for investors had arrived and even today oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 American energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best American energy stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now13. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Texas-based energy company Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the best American energy stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 44 hedge funds were long Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG). The biggest stakeholder of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) was Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management which owns a $190.1 million stake in the company.12. Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American oil company Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) ranks 12th in our list of the best American energy stocks to buy now. In August Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) jumped after the company joined the S&amp;P MidCap 400.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds out of the 2023 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK).Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) said the following in its Q2 earnings call about its future plans:“The flexibility is a competitive advantage and enables us to focus on smarter decisions for value creation through cycles. In today’s market, that means voluntarily reducing activity levels and deferring TILs in production in periods of stronger pricing. While our second quarter production reached the high end of our quarterly guidance at approximately 3.7 Bcf per day, Our second half 2023 activity will be approximately one-third lower than our first half as measured by rig spuds, completions and CapEx. As we reduce our, spend on development activities, we continue to buyback shares and have increased our base dividend. In addition to our return program, we are using our strong position to strategically lease acreage. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 10,000 acres in our Marcellus and Haynesville footprint at an average cost of $2,400 per acre and expect more opportunities to add valuable acreage in the second half of the year focused on improving and adding to our inventory length.We’re doing all of this as we continue on our path to reaching an investment-grade credit rating. Today, our net debt to total cap is about 10%, and we received two recent upgrades from our credit rating agencies. We expect that our balance sheet will be further strengthened through the completion of our Eagle Ford exit, which continues to progress. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes shareholder returns and has resulted in more than $500 million being returned to shareholders so far this year, while gas prices have fallen significantly. Our approach includes a stable and growing base dividend, which has returned $150 million year-to-date in which we raised 4.5% this quarter.”Read the complete earnings call here.Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), a natural gas exploration and production company, emerged from bankruptcy with little fanfare in 2021, despite having rid itself of its debt burden and onerous pipeline contracts. The company was able to make two large acquisitions at very reasonable prices within its core producing areas, allowing for scale and cost savings. Then in 2022, natural gas prices began to rise well above expectations, increasing the value of Chesapeake’s large natural gas resources and production and contributing to its outperformance.”11. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) shares are under pressure after the company posted weak Q2 results and a reduced dividend. Recently, TD Cowen analyst David Deckelbaum said that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s shareholder returns have ""have slowly declined while its dividend payout is 3.7% of annualized yield, down from 6% in Q2.""Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) however could be a solid buy for the long term. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management which owns a $146 million stake.10. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49American downstream petroleum company Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) ranks 10th in our list of the best American energy stocks to buy now.

The biggest stake in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) was held by Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $325 million stake in the company.9. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) swung to a loss on an adjusted basis during the second quarter amid declining commodity prices and declining sales volumes.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 51 hedge funds were long EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of the end of the second quarter. The most significant stakeholder of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which owns a $234 million stake in the company.ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“The energy sector was another positive contributor, primarily driven by our investment in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT). As North America’s leading natural gas provider, EQT had seen its share price slide as the lackluster reopening of China and a milder-than-expected winter in the northern hemisphere weighed on natural gas prices. However, as recessionary fears have given way to optimism and the prospect for greater energy demand, EQT’s share price has rebounded. While we continue to expect volatility in commodities prices, we believe that global energy demand, especially in Europe, along with the company’s leadership position in the natural gas market, make it a strong long-term compounder for the portfolio.”8. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shares jumped in July after the company posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings. Q2 Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $0.65 beating estimates by $0.14. Revenue in the period fell 22.4% year over year to $2.32 billion, missing estimates by $20 million.

The Hess operated Pickerel-1 infrastructure-led exploration well in Mississippi Canyon, encountered approximately 90-feet of net pay and high-quality oil-bearing Miocene-aged reservoir. Long lead construction activities are underway to tie the well back to the Tubular Bells production facility, with production expected to commence in mid-2024. Following Pickerel, we plan to drill the Black Pearl development well in which Hess is the operator and has a 25% working interest and Chevron, CNOC and Equinor each have 25%. This well is planned as a tieback to the Stampede Production Facility. Following Black Pearl, we plan to drill the Vancouver prospect located in Green Canyon Block 287.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.7.

Pioneer is a low-cost producer in the Permian basin and can generate free cash flow when the price of oil is more than $30 per barrel. Pioneer was one of the first companies in the industry to embrace a disciplined investment framework focused on returning excess capital to shareholders during periods of high realized pricing.

We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets, with all international geographical areas growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia. In contrast, North America revenue will be slightly down. With our focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect global operating margins to further expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:15 Countries that Export the Most Beer to the U.S.20 Most Innovative Companies in America50 Most Famous American InvestorsDisclosure: None. 13 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(I still get nightmares about stochastic calc.)But even Leibniz – a genius of his day – could have never imagined how critical his discovery would become. Not only is the chain rule used in engineering. It also now underpins the essence of machine learning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s because artificial intelligence models “learn” from mistakes using a modified version of the chain rule known as backpropagation.

Eventually, some models become so good that they can even sound sentient.The same methods now underpin most stock-picking systems, such as InvestorPlace.com’s own MarketMaster AI, a set of neural networks designed to beat the market over long periods.For investors seeking an even higher win rate over shorter time horizons, Luke Lango and his team have now unveiled Project Prometheus, an AI system designed to be predictive about which stocks will greatly outperform the market over the following four weeks. This week, his system identifies five top stocks that analysts at InvestorPlace.com — our free news site — have also highlighted.

Even though Uber sold its in-house unit three years ago, the firm has kept key robo-taxi partnerships that will prove to be tremendously profitable. Here’s more from Ramer:Story continuesUber is partnering with Motional on driverless taxis and testing Aurora Innovation’s system that enables driverless trucks. Moreover, Uber has started utilizing Alphabet’s driverless cars in Phoenix…As a result of these points, it’s clear that widely deploying robotaxis would cause Uber’s top and bottom line to skyrocket.Project Prometheus believes that now is an excellent entry point for Uber. The ride-hailing firm scores a “90” in the system, which has historically corresponded to a 16.96% average return over the next month.Uber also has become profitable, positing its first-ever operating profit last quarter. With rival Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) in retreat, it’s clear that Uber, as a stock, will benefit.2. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comAll eyes were on Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) this week after the Big 3 auto firms failed to reach a labor deal with the United Auto Workers union.The one American carmaker not on display? Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).The Austin-based electric vehicle firm employs a non-union workforce, giving it significant cost advantages to its legacy rivals. According to Payscale, the average hourly wage at Tesla is 16% lower than at Ford. UAW negotiations at Tesla’s rivals could widen that gap.Tesla’s Cybertruck launch also provides a potential catalyst for TSLA shares, as InvestorPlace.com writer Ian Cooper notes. He writes how Tesla’s 1.9 million vehicle backlog points to an incredible amount of pent-up demand.Project Prometheus agrees. This week, the system awards Tesla a score of “86,” suggesting that shares could rise 10% to 16% over the next 30 days. Though Tesla trades at a significant premium to its justified value, history tells us that strong momentum can send stocks even higher in the short run.3. U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIn March, the fate of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) seemed in question. Rival First Republic Bank was teetering on insolvency, and it wasn’t clear how far the contagion could spread.Fast forward to today, and it’s become apparent that U.S. Bancorp will succeed. In July, USB announced earnings that met topline estimates and beat on earnings per share (EPS), sending the stock up 6%. This week at InvestorPlace.com, Rich Duprey also notes that capital ratios are on the rise:U.S. Bancorp’s CET1 ratio dropped from 9.7% before the acquisition [of Union Bank] to 8.4% afterwards. It was poor timing considering the bank failures that followed. At the end of the most recent quarter, however, the CET1 capital ratio was back to 9.1%.But U.S. Bancorp gained 1.2 million new customers from the acquisition. It also got 190,000 small business customers, $58 billion in loans and $90 billion in deposits. Net interest income rise 29% as well.These catalysts could send shares up almost 10% over the next 30 days, according to Project Prometheus. The system awards U.S. Bank a score of “78,” one of the highest figures for any major bank.Long-term investors will also have plenty to like. U.S. Bancorp consistently earns over 13% return on equity, placing it well above most large banks. Shares also trade at the same levels as they did in March – a bizarre undervaluation, considering the rapid improvement in USB’s capital ratios since then.4. Cisco (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comShares of networking giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) have quietly risen 18.5% since January. The firm is a leader in artificial intelligence, and earnings are expected to rise another 8% this year as a result.This week, Louis Navellier and his staff take a deeper dive into other catalysts that could send Cisco surging.First, there could be a sooner-than-expected demand rebound in tech… The latest economic indicators point to increased chances of an economic soft landing. This could mean stronger-than-expected quarterly numbers for CSCO, resulting in shares adding to their 2023 gains during the rest of the calendar year, and into 2024.[Second], CSCO trades for 14 times forward earnings. This represents a low valuation, relative to other large top Nasdaq 100 index components… with many avenues to a re-acceleration of earnings growth, Cisco’s valuation could pop back up.Luke’s system agrees. The tech firm scores a “80” by Project Prometheus, which has historically corresponded with double-digit returns within 30 days. Though Cisco’s demand is coming down from record 2022 levels, a cheap price and a potential V-shaped recovery gives this blue-chip company plenty of potential upside.5. Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comFinally, you might have noticed prices going up at the pump.It’s not your imagination. National gas prices are now bordering on $4, a level not seen since last summer’s spike. In August, more than half of American inflation was due to rising gasoline.That’s because oil prices are on the rise. This month, prices of the West Texas Intermediary (WTI) benchmark hit $90, driven by OPEC+ cuts and a lack of new North American wells to make up the difference.Here’s where an investment in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) comes in. The Texas-based firm, also known as SLB, pioneered fracking technologies in the 1980s and remains the world’s largest offshore drilling company. Rising oil prices naturally increases demand for SLB’s services, and InvestorPlace.com writer Alex Sirois calls the firm a blue-chip stock that smart investors should be loading up on.Further increases in oil prices will keep pushing SLB higher. And Project Prometheus has picked up on that fact. This week, the system awards Schlumberger a score of “93,” which suggests returns of up to 16% over the next 30 days. Though it’s impossible to predict exactly where oil prices will land, the broad shortage of the commodity will likely keep sending shares of oil companies higher.The Power of AI InvestingResearchers have long known that stocks’ movements eventually mirror a company’s financial performance. High-earning companies tend to see their values go up over time, while underperforming ones go down.You don’t need a doctorate in finance to know that.But how can you predict stock prices over shorter time frames? Even a company as stable as SLB will see shares change price by 3%… 5%… even 10% in a week on seemingly no news.That’s where AI comes in. These systems are capable of ingesting millions of datapoints to find patterns that humans can’t see. Perhaps it’s an earnings beat in a completely unrelated company. Or rising trade volumes in a cyclical sector. These are the patterns that AI systems can quickly identify.That’s why, just this past Tuesday night, Luke finally unveiled Prometheus for the first time ever, after his team worked on it for close to three years.This system, as we’ve been discussing, is trained to predict the moment a stock is about to jump double digits or more in four weeks.And during his event on Tuesday, he asked his Prometheus AI to predict what the future holds for three of the most popular stocks in the world today…Watch this now to see this AI in action and learn how to get his latest recommendations.As of this writing, Tom Yeung held a LONG position in GM and UBER. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Tom Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

He Plans to Fix It.Once Unthinkable Bond Yields Now the New Normal for MarketsScientists Behind Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Vaccines Win NobelStriking Hollywood writers reached a new labor agreement with studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc., but production remains shut down. An actual return to filming will require a new contract between SAG-Aftra — the Screen Actors Guild — and the Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers, the studios’ bargaining group.The actors have been on the picket line since July, striking over the same issues as writers, including wages, residual pay for reruns on streaming services and protection against artificial intelligence.“We remain on strike in our TV/Theatrical contract and continue to urge the studio and streamer CEOs and the AMPTP to return to the table and make the fair deal that our members deserve and demand,” SAG said in a statement Sunday after the writers agreement was announced.The cost of this year’s labor work stoppage, now at five months, will be in the billions of dollars — and far above the $2 billion estimate from the three-month strike that hit the industry in 2007.The combined market value of Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global, three major studios, has fallen by about $50 billion since early May, with Disney accounting for three-fourths of that loss.Two other major players, NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp. and Netflix Inc., rose during the strike.And the costs continue to mount for the companies and workers. Film and TV production remains on hold, impacting not just writers and actors but directors, crew members and industries like catering and real estate. The walkout has delayed the return of new shows for the fall TV season and films for 2024.Story continuesIf all goes according to plan, governing councils of the writers union could authorize a member vote as soon as Tuesday. They could also give scribes the OK to return to their offices, letting studios catch up on delayed work on TV shows and movies. The writers walked out on May 2.“We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional – with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership,” the guild said in a statement.Read More: The Hollywood Strike Is Ending. This Is How It Happened.The writers went on strike for the first time since 2007 to fight for higher pay from streaming services, which have reshaped how TV is made and how talent gets paid. The Screen Actors Guild joined them in July.Details of the agreement won’t be announced for a few days, however people familiar with the matter said earlier that writers gained concessions on key points, including higher wages.The studios have agreed to staff a certain number of writers on their TV shows, a figure that will increase with the number of episodes in a season, one of the people said. The two sides have also created a structure in which writers will receive bonuses for popular shows on streaming services.And it appears they have also reached an agreement on the use of artificial intelligence, which writers feared could destroy jobs.The deal will initially pave the way for soap operas, game shows and late-night talk shows to resume, even if most other productions stay shut down.The momentum from the agreement should help resolve the actors’ strike quickly, according to Alex DeGroote, a media analyst in London. Even so, it will take time before big-budget shows and movies resume production, he said.“The world’s movie theatres can celebrate,” AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said on X, formerly Twitter. “Extremely good news that progress is being made.”Shares of studios were mixed on Monday. Netflix was up 0.9% at 1:33 p.m. while Disney was down 0.6%. Warner Bros Discovery fell 3.1% and Paramount Global was little changed.The studios and writers didn’t come close to a deal before the onset of the strike, and the studios and writers then didn’t negotiate for months, during which thousands of guild members protested outside the studios’ offices from New York to Los Angeles. While the economics of streaming remained the primary focus of the guilds, the threat of artificial intelligence also emerged as a growing concern.The heads of the biggest media companies got more engaged with the dispute in late July and early August, after the actors joined the strike. The studios offered a new proposal in August that addressed many, but not all, of the writers’ concerns. The two sides negotiated for a couple of weeks before breaking off yet again.The September negotiations came as a surprise. The two sides hadn’t been speaking — at least not officially — and many studio executives were debating whether it was time to engage with the actors instead.But pressure on both sides to cut a deal had increased. Studios feared the impact of months more without the ability to produce new programming, and many writers began to push their union’s leadership to cut a deal so everyone could get back to work.Read More: Why Hollywood’s Actors and Writers Are on Strike: QuickTakePeople who work in entertainment, be they writers or grips, were starting to leave Los Angeles due to the lack of progress. Prominent writers asked to meet with the leadership of the guild to discuss the state of the negotiations, and several talk shows said they would return, only to cancel plans under pressure from the unions.When the latest talks began, four of the most powerful executives in entertainment — Netflix Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav and NBCUniversal Chief Content Officer Donna Langley — joined their labor negotiators.The studios and writers negotiated for several days. After months of public acrimony and finger-pointing, the two sides kept their public communications to a minimum as they hammered out a deal to get the industry back to work.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWith Banks Offering 5% Returns, Financial Advisers Fight IrrelevanceGot Plastic With a No. 2 Recycling Symbol?

With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) due to meet on Sept. 20, there are speculations on the next course of action. ING believe that the FOMC will hold rates steady, but signal a final hike. In all probability, the market has already discounted the factor of another rate hike before 2024. To stay ahead of the curve, it’s important to look at stocks to buy based on the potential course of monetary policy action in the next few quarters.Another expert opinion suggests that the Fed is done with rate hikes. It’s likely that the policymakers will cut rates in 2024. In my view, this seems more likely and I would bet on specific themes or sectors that will benefit from a potential rate cut. It’s important to note that a rate cut would translate into a weaker dollar. Further, lower interest rates would support relatively higher leveraged investment and consumption spending.Let’s discuss three stocks to buy that are likely to trend higher as they discount the potential action from policymakers in the coming quarters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRio Tinto (RIO)A pile of iron ore granules on a black background.Source: ShutterstockRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock has remained sideways to lower year-to-date. I however believe that the stock is attractive at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.6. Further, RIO stock offers a dividend yield of 5.38%. And, their dividends are sustainable considering the Company’s free cash flow.The important point to note is that Rio reported strong results in 2021 on the back of higher commodity prices. However, the trend in revenue and EBITDA has been downwards in the last 18 months. The reason being monetary policy tightening and its impact on global GDP growth.However, with interest rates peaking out, I expect better days ahead for commodity prices. As a matter of fact, iron ore is already trading at its highest level in months. As price realization improves, Rio will be positioned to deliver higher free cash flows. Given the valuation, I would not be surprised if RIO stock trends higher by 30% to 50% in the next 24 months.Story continuesNewmont Corporation (NEM)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is another name among stocks to buy ahead of the FOMC meeting. The gold mining stock trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 19 and offers a dividend yield of 3.97%.An interesting point to note is that even with monetary policy tightening, gold is trading at $1,926 an ounce. This is indicative of the fact that gold is an undervalued asset class. Once expansionary monetary policies are pursued, I expect the precious metal to surge higher. NEM stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and a breakout rally might be in the cards.In terms of fundamentals, Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet. This provides high financial flexibility for investment in the Company’s quality asset base. Further, as gold trends higher, free cash flows will swell and provide headroom for robust dividend growth. I must add that the Company’s exposure to copper assets is likely to be a value creator. The metal will see sustained demand on the back of global decarbonization investments.Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is another undervalued stock that’s worth buying before the FOMC meeting. CVX stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and offers a dividend yield of 3.63%.It’s worth noting that oil is already trading above $90 per barrel. A rate hike pause and potential rate cut in 2024 is good news for black gold. Chevron, with an investment grade balance sheet, it worth considering.From a fundamental perspective, Chevron expects to invest $14 to $16 billion annually through 2027. These investments will translate into steady revenue and cash flow upside. It’s important to note that the big investments can be funded through internal cash flows.To put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow (OCF) of $6.3 billion for Q2 2023. This would imply an annualized OCF of $25 billion at a time when realized oil price was around $80 per barrel. With a possible rally in crude oil, Chevron will be positioned to create value through dividends and repurchase.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We will also be looking at the current market conditions and some of the big players in this industry while covering the major fuel exporting countries in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Fuel Exporting Countries in the World.The Fuel Industry: An OverviewFuel, as a source of energy, powers the world. The fuel industry is diverse, ranging from fossil fuels such as crude oil and natural gas to solid fuels namely wood and coal. While upstream companies in the fuel industry generate cash flows from extracting oil and gas from reserves, downstream beneficiaries of oil and gas production include refineries that remove impurities from crude oil to convert it into gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, and others. Oil and gas reserves around the world are declared proven if there is a 90% or greater certainty of them being present and economically viable for extraction.Current Market ConditionsAccording to an outlook of the oil and gas industry for 2023, Deloitte reported that issues such as supply chain disruptions and fluctuation in oil prices have been common. Oil and gas companies have also been resorting to cleaner energy sources. There has also been a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas.In September, the International Energy Agency reported an analysis of the global oil market for different regions around the world. In August, the Russian oil exports declined but the revenues from these exports rose due to high prices. China and India accounted for the majority of Russian oil exports. The oil supplies from Saudi Arabia also reduced which is further expected to create a market deficit in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the IEA.On September 7, Reuters reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia have further announced to extend their supply cuts till the end of 2023. The higher oil prices resulting from this tight supply are interwoven with global politics as the US believes that Russia needs to be prevented from earning higher revenues from rising oil prices which it uses to fund the Ukrainian war. While the European Union has imposed caps on Russian exports of oil, oil continues to be traded at higher prices.Story continuesA Competitive LandscapeThe oil and gas industry is saturated with different incumbents who continue to strive for their market positions. Some of these include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil and gas companies both in terms of market value and production. The company is vertically integrated across the oil and gas industry and also serves to be a significant global oil refiner. On August 28, Reuters reported that the company has extended its carbon capture joint development partnership with FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) till March 2024. FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) is a leading manufacturer and distributor of fuel cell energy platforms. FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) has been helping the firm through its carbonate fuel cells which reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power generation process. Another recent development by the company is the startup of two new chemical production units at its Baytown facility. On September 19, the company reported that this $2 billion expansion was aimed to fulfill the rising demand for high-value products in the market. The company has also entered the linear alpha olefins market through its new unit which will produce 350,000 tons of branded products under the name Elevexx, the company’s new linear alpha olefins-producing subsidiary.Another leader in the oil and gas industry is Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The company engages in the exploration, production, and refining of hydrocarbons. It is also one of the largest oil companies in the United States, by revenue. On September 8, the company’s Australian LNG plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone, which supply more than 5% of the global LNG, became subjected to labor strikes. On September 22, Reuters reported that full production at the company's facilities had resumed as the company agreed to resolve all outstanding issues of the workers. The Offshore Alliance representing Chevron Corporation’s (NYSE:CVX) worker unions, called off strikes after accepting a deal from Australia’s Fair Work Commission. However, the details of the agreement have not yet been publicly disclosed.Shell plc (NYSE:RDS) is a leading British multinational oil and gas company. On September 22, Reuters reported that the company entered into an agreement with Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company to supply it with natural gas till 2036. The company will be supplying a minimum of 150 million cubic feet per day of gas to Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company from the Manatee offshore field which is shared by Trinidad and Venezuela and is expected to supply gas from 2028. This agreement will also support Trinidad and Tobago with its petrochemical and power sectors which are subject to gas shortages and reduced refining capacities currently.Now that we have taken a look at the global fuel industry and what the major players such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) are up to, we can examine the 34 fuel exporting countries in the world.34 Fuel Exporting Countries in the WorldCopyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to compile a list of the 34 fuel exporting economies in the world, we sourced data from the UN World Economic Situation and Prospects report from 2023. We referred to the fuel exporting countries in this report. These countries belong to developed, developing, and in-transit economies in the world.We have used the percentage of fuel exports in total exports as our metric for identifying every fuel exporting country. These percentages have been extracted from the country profiles listed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). According to UNCTAD, a country is considered a fuel exporter if its fuel exports account for greater than 20% of its total merchandise exports where the fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas. This criteria was the rationale behind our metric for this research.Thus, we have ranked the 34 fuel exporting countries in the world in ascending order of their fuel exports as a percentage of the total exports.34 Fuel Exporting Countries in the World:34. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) Percentage of Fuel Exports in Total Exports: 24%Bolivia exports a major portion of its local oil and gas production.

57,2acf3597-d30f-3617-ac8f-d1a3a2713402,NOV,2023-09-25,Oil prices have risen. That's making gas more expensive for US drivers and helping Russia's war,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-risen-thats-making-091958886.html,1695633598,STORY,['CL=F'],"[FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Oil prices have risen, meaning drivers are paying more for gasoline and truckers and farmers more for diesel.The increase also complicates the global fight against inflation and feeds Russia's war chest. That poses problems for politicians as well as the people having to spend more to get to work, transport the world's goods or harvest fields.Here are things to know about the recent increase — and where prices might be going:WHY HAVE OIL PRICES RISEN?Above all, Saudi Arabia's decision to cut back how much oil it sends to global markets has pushed prices higher.The world's second-largest oil supplier has slashed production by 1 million barrels a day since July and decided this month to extend the cut through the end of the year.Russia, Saudi Arabia's ally in the OPEC+ oil producers' coalition, also extended its own cut of 300,000 barrels a month through 2023.Simply, tighter supply means higher prices.International benchmark Brent oil traded at just under $94 per barrel Monday, up from $90 before the extension on Sept. 5 and from $74 before the Saudi cut was first announced. U.S. oil traded at around $90.50, up from $68 before the Saudi cut.HOW HIGH COULD OIL PRICES GO?Some analysts think oil could hit $100 a barrel based on robust demand and limited supply. But that's far from the only view.Oil prices can be volatile, and while they might briefly top $100 in the coming months, they're unlikely to stay there, said Jorge Leon, senior vice president for oil markets at Rystad Energy. He foresees prices in the low $90s on average in the last three months of the year.That's still high historically, he said, supported by “resilient” demand for fuel to drive and fly.The Saudi cuts were a unilateral move outside the framework of the OPEC+ alliance, meaning the kingdom can make changes as needed to quickly respond to shifting market conditions.Leon said the Saudis will review the cuts each month — and could add barrels back if prices spike to levels that could seriously worsen inflation in countries buying oil. Excessive price increases could mean central banks worldwide hike interest rates further or keep them higher for longer.Story continues“I don't think it will be clever for the Saudis to push that hard,” Leon said. “The last thing you want to do is fuel inflation again with much higher oil prices. That's going to kill economic growth, and lower growth is going to mean lower oil demand at the end of the day.”WHAT OTHER FACTORS AFFECT PRICES?A big question is demand for fuel, which is picking up along with rebounding travel following the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. A robust U.S. economy increases demand for oil — and the price — while weak growth in China and Europe has the opposite effect.“We see the upside potential for the oil price as being virtually used up and if anything envisage setback potential in view of the weak economy,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, Commerzbank head of commodities research who foresees oil at $85 per barrel by year's end. “The oil price is only likely to climb more lastingly once the economic outlook begins to brighten, which should be the case next year.”Another factor is financial speculation, and it appears investors are piling into the oil market with bets that prices will rise.“Much of the price surge beyond $85 per barrel is due to a flood of speculative money, while fundamentally there is still plenty of oil in the world to meet demand for now,” said Gary Peach, oil markets analyst at Energy Intelligence.Plus, more Iranian oil may come on the market as the U.S. “turns a blind eye” on enforcing sanctions to keep prices from rising further, Leon said. That could add 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day.WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS?Costlier oil feeds through to higher prices for gasoline and diesel, especially in the U.S., where roughly half the pump price reflects the cost of crude — the rest is marketing, taxes and other costs.Crude is a smaller share of gasoline and diesel prices in Europe because fuel taxes are much higher there.Average U.S. pump prices are still well below the record $5 per gallon seen in summer 2022. But at $3.85 per gallon, they're still up 15 cents from a year ago. Oil costs are keeping gas prices high even as driving demand drops with the end of summer vacations and plentiful gasoline stocks, according to auto club AAA.Diesel prices have risen as well, along with higher oil costs and refineries facing shortages of the specific kinds of crude best for making diesel. Refineries also are choosing to produce jet fuel instead, chasing profits as air travel rebounds. A gallon of diesel cost $4.58 last week, up from $4.34 a month ago.That hurts farmers, who use a lot of diesel, and adds to the price of consumer goods transported by truck, which is pretty much everything.Diesel supplies got even tighter Friday after Russia said it would halt the export of refined oil products to hold down fuel prices at home.HOW DO HIGHER OIL PRICES HELP RUSSIA?Oil is Russia's main moneymaker, so higher prices help the Kremlin pay for its invasion of Ukraine and weather sweeping Western sanctions aimed at crushing its wartime economy.The recent rise in oil prices, along with a cutback in the discount that sanctions forced Russia to offer Asian customers, means Moscow will earn “significantly more revenue from those exports,” said Benjamin Hilgenstock, senior economist at the Kyiv School of Economics.The additional revenue could reach an estimated $17 billion this year and $33 billion next year, he said in an online talk hosted by the Brussels-based European Policy Center.Russia has lost some $100 billion in oil revenue following a European Union import ban and a $60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven major economies, which bars Western insurers and shippers from handling oil priced above that level.Russia, however, has increasingly found ways around the cap, including using a fleet of ghost tankers masking their ownership and origin of the crude they carry.Any additional export earnings help support Russia's currency and what it can import — including weapons components.WHAT ARE THE POLITICS?U.S. President Joe Biden has faced criticism from Republican lawmakers to encourage more oil drilling and scrap his support for electric vehicles.But that criticism largely overlooks the rise in U.S. oil production over the past year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that oil production averaged 12.8 million barrels a day in June, up 1 million barrels from 12 months ago, close to the levels achieved before the pandemic began in 2020.Biden has said he considers oil production essential to keep the economy going as a bridge to a future with EVs and renewable energy.Still, the White House views the oil market worldwide as being undersupplied, in line with recent OPEC data that indicates there will likely be a worldwide shortfall of 3 million barrels a day. The administration is also in touch with domestic and international producers on longtime supply needs, trying to ensure that the risk of higher oil prices does not disrupt economic growth.___Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed from Washington.]"

It was unchanged against the yuan at 13.15 CNYRUBTOM=MCX.On Thursday, Russia's government said a new set of export duties linked to the rouble-dollar exchange rate would be introduced on Oct. 1 and last until the end of next year.The move should lead to extra government revenues - as much as 600 billion roubles ($6.23 billion) per year, according to seven Reuters sources. It could also buttress the rouble.The government said the duty would not apply if the rouble strengthened beyond 80 to the dollar. Otherwise it would range from 4% to 7%, reaching its maximum if the rouble was weaker than 95 per dollar.Also on Thursday, Russia temporarily banned exports of gasoline and diesel to all countries outside a circle of four ex-Soviet states with immediate effect in order to stabilise the domestic market.Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 0.5% at $93.75 a barrel.The rouble should be supported by month-end tax payments this week, but now in the absence of hefty sales of foreign currency sales by the central bank, the currency is likely to start weakening, said Alexei Antonov of Alor Broker.""Most likely, the monetary authorities will take additional measures to prevent the rouble from falling,"" Antonov said.Russian stock indexes were lower.The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 0.7% to 993.3 points.

However, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, says that it does not mean the prospect of one taking place has completely evaporated.“While the investor sentiment pendulum on a recession arriving in 2023 has swung from roughly ’70/30′ to ’30/70′ over the past 6 months based on our dialogue, there is more debate on whether we have avoided it altogether – i.e., soft/no landing, or if it’s just been pushed out to 2024,” Wilson recently said,Given the uncertainty about what’s coming next, Wilson expects the market to trade in a “late cycle” manner and he recommends a way to deal with such an environment. “In our view,” says the strategist, “the best way to express that in a portfolio is to hold a barbell of defensive growth (select growth stories and more traditional defensive sectors like Healthcare and Consumer Staples) with late-cycle cyclicals.”Taking that advice to heart, the analysts at Morgan Stanley have been busy pointing out stocks with such attributes and ones they believe investors should be loading up on right now.We ran 3 of their picks through the TipRanks database to find out whether the rest of the Street is comfortable with these choices. Turns out they certainly are; all are currently rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s see why they are drawing plaudits across the board.Howmet Aerospace (HWM)The first Morgan Stanley pick we’ll look at certainly has the defensive credentials to deal with uncertain times. Howmet Aerospace is a global leader in advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and defense (A&amp;D) industries. Formerly known as Arconic, the company rebranded as Howmet Aerospace in 2020 following a separation from its parent company. With a rich history dating back to the early days of aviation, Howmet Aerospace is an established provider of high-performance materials and precision-engineered components that play a critical role in the functioning of modern aircraft and defense systems.Story continuesStrong demand for jet parts on account of plane makers ramping up production activities saw Howmet raise its full-year profit and revenue outlook when the company reported Q2 earnings in early August. Howmet called for 2023 revenue between $6.40 billion and $6.47 billion, up from the prior $6.20 billion to $6.33 billion range. Adj. EPS was increased from between $1.65 to $1.70 per share to between $1.69 and $1.71.The new forecasts came off the back of a strong quarterly performance. Revenue reached $1.65 billion, amounting to an 18.7% year-over-year increase while beating the consensus estimate by $40 million. Adj. EPS of $0.44 edged ahead of the Street’s call by $0.01.After paying a visit to the company’s Michigan-based Whitehall Plant, it’s clear to Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag why Howmet is a leader in its field – a situation she does not see changing any time soon and that is good news for investors.“The company’s investment in technology and automation underscores how it was able to take market share, increase price, and expand margins,” Liwag said. “We continue to expect operating performance to be a meaningful differentiator in monetizing the aerospace upcycle. What we saw from our visit is that Howmet has invested in cutting edge technologies and automation in its manufacturing processes to deliver on customer requirements. Additionally, the company continues to invest to support future growth. Its strength in operations also provides upside to long-term margins for shareholders. We continue to see Howmet as our Top Pick in Aerospace.”These comments underpin Liwag’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on HWM, while her $60 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 31%. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here)That thesis gets the backing of most of Liwag’s colleagues. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 11 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. Going by the $54.31 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for ~19% premium. (See HWM stock forecast)Thermo Fisher (TMO)The second pick from Morgan Stanley brings us to Thermo Fisher, a global leader in scientific research and laboratory equipment. This giant with a $194 billion market cap serves a wide range of industries and sectors and is one of the world’s largest and most influential providers of scientific solutions. Thermo Fisher’s extensive portfolio includes instruments, reagents, consumables, software, and services designed to support research, diagnostics, and manufacturing processes in fields such as life sciences, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, environmental monitoring, and more.Despite its size and global reach, the macro environment has blighted its recent performance and the company missed expectations on both the top-and bottom-line in Q2. Revenue fell by 2.6% YoY to $10.69 billion, missing the analysts’ forecast by $310 million. Adj. EPS of $5.15 also fell short of the consensus estimate – by $0.28.The outlook was not much to shout about either. The company lowered its forecast for the year, now seeing $43.4–$44.0 billion in revenue (down from the prior $45.3 billion) and adj. EPS of $22.28–$22.72 (vs. $23.70 before), both also below consensus.The lackluster quarterly results have mirrored the stock’s performance this year and the shares are down by 9% year-to-date. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Tejas Savant argues the bottom might just be in, making this health colossus worthy of investors’ consideration.“In the near-term, we continue to feel confident in TMO’s ability to deliver above market growth relative to peers when factoring in macro conditions and view the reduced ’23 outlook as achievable with room for further upside should we see a strong year-end budget flush or a faster recovery in China,” Savant explained. “Moreover, with investor sentiment in Tools now appearing to have bottomed, we see the reset (not just in 2H23 but also in 2024 estimates) as making the stock ‘ownable’ again.”“Longer term, we continue to believe that TMO is among the best positioned across the sector to drive above -peer/-market growth, given the combination of a resilient and diversified business model, strong operational track record, best-in-class mgmt team (that has demonstrated consistent all-weather execution), increasing exposure to high-growth verticals within their ~$225B TAM, and embedded capital deployment optionality,” Savant went on to add.Accordingly, Savant rates TMO shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy), backed by a $640 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 27% from current levels. (To watch Savant’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on TMO shares. 11 Buys and 1 Sell issued over the previous three months make the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $627.50 average price target suggests ~25% upside from current levels. (See TMO stock forecast)Zoetis Inc. (ZTS)For our final Morgan Stanley selection, we’ll remain within the realm of healthcare, albeit in a unique niche. With a market cap over $81 billion, Zoetis is a leading global animal health firm dedicated to improving the health and well-being of animals. Founded in 1952 as a subsidiary of Pfizer, Zoetis became an independent company in 2013, and operates in more than 100 countries.The company specializes in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a wide range of veterinary medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and other products essential for the care and welfare of animals and serves a customer base that includes veterinarians, livestock producers, and pet owners.The latest Q2 report delivered solid results on all fronts. Revenue surged by 4.8% year-over-year, reaching $2.2 billion, which exceeded expectations by $40 million. Additionally, the adj. EPS of $1.41 trumped the $1.31 forecast.The beats were accompanied by a mixed outlook. Full-year revenue is expected in the range of $8.50 billion to $8.65 billion, down from the range between $8.58 billion to $8.73 billion, although it still stuck to its operational revenue growth target. The profitability profile, on the other hand, got a boost. The company now anticipates full-year adj. EPS between $5.37 to $5.47 per share vs. $5.34 to $5.44 per share beforehand.Looking at Zoetis’ prospects, Morgan Stanley analyst Erin Wright thinks the company is moving in the right direction and believes it is not given the respect it deserves.“While the latest print had several moving pieces, it was still somewhat cleaner than its recent reports, and it encouragingly reaffirmed its operational growth guide, suggesting strengthening trends for the balance of the year,” the 5-star analyst commented. “We continue to view the unmatched breadth of ZTS’ portfolio as significantly underappreciated, with continuing innovation expected to further distinguish ZTS from competitors with over 300 projects in its R&amp;D pipeline and with new products enhancing its exposure to faster-growing, more profitable categories.”Quantifying this stance, Wright rates Zoetis shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) with a $248 price target, implying shares will post growth of 40% in the months ahead. (To watch Wright’s track record, click here)Overall, the analysts are all behind this one; Zoetis gets a full house of Buys – 8, in total – all naturally coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are expected to appreciate by 26% over the course of the year, considering the average target stands at $223.25.

62,7d015419-7538-3c46-95a1-86ef01fcfdad,SPGI,2023-09-25,"Autonomous Vehicle Reality Check: Widespread Adoption Remains at Least a Decade Away, according to S&P Global Mobility",PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autonomous-vehicle-reality-check-widespread-110000951.html,1695639600,STORY,['SPGI'],"[The era of peak hype has passed, but forecasters still see long-term adoption in certain segments that benefit from today's rise in automated driving technology SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Sept. 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A world of self-driving vehicles and mobility-on-demand is likely to exist eventually, but for the next decade, widespread implementation of autonomous technology will not be realized, according to a new forecast from S&amp;P Global Mobility. The report reflects findings from robust model-level forecasting that autonomous vehicle expectations have not been fulfilled and still face more headwinds – affording significant opportunity and scale to automated driving implementations in the interim.2035 Global Light Vehicle Sales by Autonomy LevelFor the next decade, autonomous tech will be limited to two specific areas: geofenced robotaxis operated by fleets in specific areas, and hands-off systems with various safeguards in personal vehicles that will still require some form of driver engagement.The latest forecast from S&amp;P Global Mobility notes that Level 5 Autonomy – ""A vehicle that can go anywhere and do everything a human driver can,"" will not be publicly available before 2035, ""and probably for some time after that,"" stated Jeremy Carlson, associate director for the autonomy practice at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""But the outlook for more targeted implementations of the same fundamental technologies, especially in Level 2+ and Level 3 but also for some forms of Level 4, is more positive and will certainly happen on a much shorter timeline.""This latest outlook from S&amp;P Global Mobility reflects the headwinds and slower pace of development that both the automotive and tech industries have demonstrated over the past several years. It paints a stark contrast to the optimism of just five years ago when the world was swept up in the promise and excitement of a future of self-driving vehicles in Levels 4 and 5. Now, S&amp;P Global Mobility presents a more realistic outlook amid this moderated pace of progress while also publishing new data on the intersection of autonomy and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS).Story continuesAutomated – rather than autonomous – driving continues to be the focus of industry development. Today's broad deployments of Level 2+ and Level 3 systems by many automakers in multiple regions will reach at least 31% of new vehicle sales globally by 2035, according to the forecast. L2+ and L3 allow the driver to be hands-off while supervising, or to disengage entirely in specific driving scenarios, such as in Super Cruise by General Motors and Drive Pilot by Mercedes-Benz, respectively.""There is immense opportunity for automated driving systems in L2+ and L3, and they are benefiting from the standardization of basic safety features which provide a foundation of in-vehicle architecture, sensing, and compute,"" Carlson says. ""Their functionality also complements driving today rather than fully replacing the driver, making consumer adoption less of a challenge. The next several years of wider deployment across brands and vehicle platforms will be a boon for automakers selling these optional features as well as suppliers who continue to build scale and a strong foundation for the future.""L4 Technology Slow to Develop in Personal Vehicles – MaaS Robotaxis to Lead the WayThe S&amp;P Global Mobility forecast predicts fewer than 6% of light vehicles sold in 2035 will have any Level 4 functionality, as described by the SAE J3016 classification. Early L4 implementations in personally-owned vehicles offer advanced parking functions, often with the support of infrastructure. But many technology providers remain focused on the long-term potential of scaling autonomous vehicles in fleets supporting MaaS business models.There are positive examples of autonomous vehicles performing as well as humans in today's pilot programs in places like San Francisco and Phoenix in the US, and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in Mainland China. But these same vehicles can still be confounded by complex traffic scenarios the next minute or the next day, giving regulators and consumers alike reason to be cautious.Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and robotaxis are nonetheless expected to lead the transition to an autonomous vehicle future, even with the relatively cautious growth ahead. There are growing numbers of small-scale deployments in certain cities around the world. But S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasters do not expect that to become widespread and broadly accessible within the next decade.MaaS-equipped vehicles and robotaxi applications are expected to represent less than 800,000 vehicles sold globally in 2035. Robotaxis will be carefully geofenced for the foreseeable future – offering revenue service only within specific areas where they have already been extensively tested, Carlson predicts. But their high rate of utilization can be nonetheless effective at bringing new mobility options to some consumers and new revenue streams to automakers and mobility providers.Owen Chen, senior principal analyst from S&amp;P Global Mobility, explains that robotaxi development and commercialization is a complex and multi-stage process which can be summarized in three stages. First, technical feasibility demonstrations confirm that robotaxis can operate safely and reliably in the targeted conditions. Second, the long process of technology optimization, integration, and refining vehicle design eventually brings scale to manufacturing and deployment. Third is the efficient expansion to many new locations and operating conditions, with profit on top of revenue from meaningful adoption by consumers. Chen adds that, ""In 2023, many are working through stage 1 while several are seeking scale in stage 2, led by Mainland China and the US. But the opportunity to restructure personal and shared mobility exists.""In August, the California Public Utility Commission approved an expansion of operations in San Francisco for Waymo and Cruise. Mainland Chinese regulators are also enabling providers like Baidu Apollo, Pony AI, WeRide and more to test or operate paid services in parts of many major Chinese cities. Europe is also actively developing regulations to help bring some uniformity to such vehicles and services across the region.While the US captured an early lead in both development and deployment of L4 MaaS, Mainland China is expected to contribute the greatest volumes long-term, followed by the US and Europe in that order, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility.Challenges nonetheless remain for successful and widespread deployment of L4 MaaS. In addition to a fragmented regulatory landscape and relatively low public trust that may hamper consumer acceptance and adoption, the cost of technology and the time needed for robust development and validation of hardware and software have quashed the optimism that defined much of the last decade.Reduced complexity in L2+ and L3 features face less risk or uncertainty for each of these factors, hence the more positive outlook for those technologies in the short term. This optimism is further boosted as some regulators are also mandating certain basic safety assistance features that will generate even wider exposure for selective automation.Automakers, suppliers, technology companies and mobility providers alike, however, remain committed to a future of safe and equitable autonomous mobility, even if it takes more time to get there.""There's plenty of opportunity and growth ahead,"" says Carlson. ""Significant volumes measured in the hundreds of thousands per year are quite likely to come before 2030—but a future of shared mobility everywhere all the time will remain an aspiration for the industry.""For the full report, click here.About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

To skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Expensive Cities to Visit in the US. If 2022 was the year of a deliberated return to travel, 2023 has seen a global head-first dive into tourism. As travel resumes and builds momentum to pre-pandemic levels, the resilience of the global tourism industry cannot be understated. Against all projections, international travel made a resounding comeback in 2022 with visitor numbers to Europe and the Middle East climbing to more than eighty percent of 2019 levels. The United States alone recovered more than sixty five percent of pre-pandemic tourists, even to its most expensive cities to visit. This is a remarkable feat especially since it was achieved as China doubled down on its 'Zero-COVID' policy, effectively restricting the world's largest outbound travel market. According to an article by Bloomberg, travel is set to become a $15.5 trillion industry by 2033, accounting for more than 11.6% of the global economy. To know more about the tourism industry and some of the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S and around the world, read our article on World Tourism Rankings by Country: Top 20 Countries. According to a survey by Forbes, recovery for the global travel industry in America is expected to continue on its current trajectory. International tourist arrivals are likely to reach more than 95 percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023 subject to economic headwinds, travel resurgence in the Asia-Pacific and global geopolitical turbulence. In the survey, 87% of respondents said they expect to travel more than they did in 2022 especially to the most expensive cities in the U.S. This is impressive considering the fact that nearly 45% of these respondents travelled once or twice in 2022, with 42% travelling three or more times. More than half of the respondents seemed to favor leisure trips, with the other half showing enthusiasm with respect to road trips, beach vacations, and romantic getaways. Moreover, 54% of respondents are allowing for a higher travel budgets in 2023. While it doesn't exactly mean that Americans are immune to skyrocketing inflation rates, it does mean that travel is assuming a higher priority for American consumers. It is for these reasons that investors are flocking towards prominent travel stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Furthermore, the global shift towards electronic payment methods and the fact that nearly 81% of travelers use credit and debit cards have also led to strong investor sentiment around stocks like Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP). Story continuesGlobal Travel in 2023: Six Key TrendsAs the global travel rebound continues, increasing costs, deteriorating macroeconomic climates and rising inflation rates are also leading to a significant shift in consumer attitudes. While tourist spending is showing a 112% increase compared to 2021 according to Bloomberg, the resulting shift in consumer attitudes has led Simon-Kucher to identify the emergence of six primary trends that are impacting the travel industry, in a study conducted in 2023. These trends are an incredibly strong indicator in determining consumer behavior during the holiday season. Companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) can study and use these insights to adapt to the shift in tourist behavior, not only in the United States but around the world.One of the first trends to emerge is that the cost-of-living is the primary determinant when it comes to consumer priorities. Although more than 84% of American tourists remain largely undeterred by rising prices and inflationary pressures, one in five maintain that they would consider skipping their vacation plans owing to financial constraints and would largely avoid the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S. As the cost-of-living peaks in 2023, people are more inclined on focusing on essentials and reserving their travel plans for outside the peak holiday season. To know more about some of the most expensive cities to live in the U.S, read our article on the 30 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the U.S.Secondly, another emerging trend is that inflation is a fundamental driver in determining advance booking patterns by consumers. According to the study, consumer booking lead time has hardly changed as compared to 2022, with more than 41% of tourists booking their vacation accommodations further in advance as compared to 2022. As fears of rising inflation rates mount, people are pushed increasingly towards advanced booking options, with 37% of tourists claiming they resort to advance booking to avoid inflation-driven price hikes in the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S. Since advance booking is largely carried out through electronic payment, companies like Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) have the most to gain from this trend. Thirdly, the rise of personalized travel is an emerging trend which is set to radically transform the travel industry in 2023. The number of consumers opting for personalized travel plans in lieu of all-inclusive ones is steadily rising, with more than half of the travelers in the U.S. selecting a personalized trip for their most recent vacation. Across global markets, personalized travel has increased by more than six percent.Furthermore, the rise of personalized travel coupled with increasing inflationary headwinds have given rise to segmented travel spending. Although consumer spending is anticipated to increase by eight percent regardless of rising inflation rates, growing financial constraints has given rise to three kinds of tourists: splurge, who plan to spend 20% more on tourism in 2023; stable, who plan to spend the same as they did in 2022; and cautious, who plan to spend six percent less. Splurge travelers show an increased proclivity towards personalized travel, whereas cautious and stable tourists are more inclined towards all-inclusive packages. Although tourists are planning to cut expenditure when it comes to souvenirs and local experiences, they largely intend on spending more on food, drinks and accommodation.Business travel seems to be on the downlow, with one in five respondents reporting they shall not be travelling for work. Companies have also been revisiting their travel policies, with more organizations now encouraging their employees to travel by rail rather than by air. This shift in sentiment is largely due to the rise of new virtual technologies like the metaverse. However, if you want to know about jobs that still contain a significant amount of travel, check out our article on 10 Best Jobs for People who Want to Travel.Lastly, as the world recognizes the need to meet sustainability objectives in light of the climate crisis, the tourism industry is also set to adapt. Sustainability is emerging as an immensely important priority for tourists, with one in three willing to spend more on sustainable options. The United States is leading this initiative, with 33 percent of consumers reporting that they are willing to spend more on vacation packages that meet environmental sustainability objectives. According to the study, holidaymakers have little qualms spending 55% higher on sustainable food, accommodation, and flights. In light of this trend, companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) are diverting greater investments to their sustainability imperatives to attract more favorable investor sentiment.

According to an analysis by McKinsey and Company, labor supply and demand remains unbalanced post the pandemic. Today, in the United States, more than 7% of tourism jobs are projected to remain unfilled.According to McKinsey, the industry is facing a mass exodus of tourism staff, especially from customer-centric roles, and the possibility of bringing these employees back is not expected to materialize any time soon. Hotels, restaurants, cruises, and airlines continue to face serious staff shortages which are translating into operational, reputational, and financial hiccups. If unaddressed, the labor gap may restrict the travel industry's projected growth trajectory.Some reasons that supplement this shortage may be chronic workplace challenges, the effects of the pandemic, high seasonality and low regulation of tourism jobs, long working hours, low wages, lack of social protection, and the informality of the overall working condition. The tourism industry would do well if it were to recalibrate some of its fundamentals to build a far more sustainable future. It can achieve this by either making the industry attractive to employees or by improving upon their product portfolio to complement existing staffing needs. Another solution could be to integrate within the workforce, digital and interpersonal skills needed to cater to the fast changing needs of the consumer. This new technology could be utilized to provide customers with a digitally enhanced experience, make up for labor shortages, and improve working conditions.5 Cheapest Countries to Live in EuropePhoto by Mesut Kaya on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the 30 most expensive cities to visit in the U.S, we decided to use a variety of third-party research. We first shortlisted the hundred most visited cities in the United States based on data from Allianz Partners, which reported on the top travel destinations in the U.S. between the period of 2017-2022. Then, we used three primary metrics to determine the average cost of travel per person per day in each city: average accommodation prices for one night at a mid-range hotel, food and dining costs in mid-range restaurants, and transportation expenses. We used data from Trivago and Booking.com to get the July 2023 prices of five mid-range hotels in each city. We then calculated the average to arrive at the overnight accommodation price in each city. To calculate the average food and dining expenditure, we used indices from Numbeo. And finally, to calculate average transportation costs, we used statistical data from the US. Department of Transportation. After we had compiled data on all three metrics, we averaged out our findings to obtain the average cost of travel per person per day in each city. We then ranked the cities based on the average costs, from lowest to highest.You can also read about some of the most popular tourist destinations within the U.S. in our article 30 Top Tourist Attractions in the U.S.Most Expensive Cities to Visit in the US30.

Eliminating the need to enter a PIN or authenticate via mobile device, drivers can now leverage convenient payments to enhance the in-vehicle experience. The native in-car payment service via Mercedes pay+ will turn the car into a form of payment device and can be used to make payments at service stations using the fingerprint sensor integrated into the MBUX infotainment system. This is now live with Mastercard debit and credit cards in current Mercedes-Benz models.1Fingerprint payment authorization at a gas station represents the first use case for native in-car payments at the point of sale, in addition to Mercedes-Benz as the world's first automaker to integrate Mastercard's Secure Card on File for Commerce platform into the car. This technology allows for transaction data to be encrypted using uniquely assigned cryptograms,2 in turn protecting sensitive payment information.""With Mercedes pay+, we are making everyday life easier for our customers. From now on, they can pay their fuel bill directly from their car using their fingerprint – simply, securely, and conveniently. An intuitive payment process and a best-in-class customer experience lay the foundation for the success of digital offerings. We are pioneers in native in-car payment and are already working on the integration of further services,"" said Franz Reiner, Chairman of the Board of Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG.Story continuesA study conducted by the German market research company GfK on behalf of Mastercard shows that around half of 18- to 39-year-olds would order and pay for services and goods directly via the infotainment display. The proponents would like to use in-car payment primarily for everyday car-related services: 60 percent would pay their gas bill or electric vehicle charging directly via the car.""Digital payments are coming of age, and consumers want to embrace new forms that are infused into their everyday experiences and activities,"" said Jorn Lambert, Chief Digital Officer at Mastercard. ""Through our dynamic payments technology, we are proud to work hand in hand with Mercedes-Benz to bring safer, smarter, and more intelligent commerce experiences to its vehicles. We look forward to our continued efforts to drive further innovation in this area in Germany and around the world.""Emerging Payments Analyst Christopher Miller, Javelin added, ""This joint effort between Mastercard and Mercedes-Benz to enable native in-car payments for fueling is an example of a real-world step towards a more seamless and integrated payments ecosystem that brings together consumer need, the right data, and payment credentials to reduce payment friction while retaining payment security. The announcement highlights the importance of payments experiences that are truly integrated from end-to-end – from authentication hardware in the vehicle, to calculation of fuel costs and needs, to email delivery of receipts. Payment flows that are truly differentiated will persuade consumers to adopt emerging technologies such as pay-by-car. Delivering on these types of experiences requires partners with the capability to coordinate all of these different components into something that is easy for consumers to both use and understand.""How in-car payment with fingerprint worksWhen a driver reaches a connected service station and switches off the engine, the Mercedes me Fuel &amp; Pay service will start automatically on the MBUX infotainment system.3 Once started, the driver can simply select the appropriate gas pump. Even before refueling, the system will calculate the maximum total amount based on the current fuel price and the amount of fuel when the tank is full. And rather than authorizing the payment via a mobile device, the driver will complete their transaction seamlessly through fingerprint authentication.4 After refueling, the driver will see the amount of fuel refueled and the invoice amount to their Mastercard debit or credit cards on the MBUX display. Payment will be made automatically, and the driver will be able to leave the gas station without having to walk to the checkout area. The invoice is then sent to the customer by e-mail.Where to find Mercedes me Fuel &amp; PayContactless payment via Mercedes me Fuel &amp; Pay and fingerprint sensor is now possible at over 3,600 cooperating gas stations in Germany. Consumers can use their German-issued5 Mastercard credit or debit cards for native in-car payment by registering their card in the Mercedes me user account and activating it in the vehicle via the MBUX infotainment system Mercedes pay+.Fingerprint payments from the car will be extended soon to other vehicle-related services and to other European markets.For more information from Mercedes-Benz Mobility, please visit: group-media.mercedes-benz.com and www.mercedes-benz-mobility.com/de/media-site/Read more: Mercedes pay CEO Nico Kersten discusses the evolution of in-car payments with the Mastercard Newsroom: https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2023/mercedes-pay-ceo-on-securing-the-future-of-in-car-payments/About MastercardMastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Investments for Beginners.Investors remain skeptic on the economy’s ability to completely avoid a recession. Last month equities saw a selloff driven by persistent inflation, weak jobs report and China’s economic woes. Analysts believe the Fed’s battle against inflation still has a long way to go and recession could hit the economy in the first half of 2024. Some circles however voice a lot of optimism on the back of solid state of the consumer in the US. While inflation worried some segments of the market, the bulls say the latest uptick in inflation was caused by higher energy prices. Consumer spending in the US remains strong despite the hammering households have taken due to inflation over the past several months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the “fear gauge” of the Wall Street, recently fell to its lowest point since the pandemic. VIX shows the market’s expectation of volatility based on S&amp;P 500 index options.For beginner investors with low risk appetite and limited budgets, the current market environment may seem like a chaos. Inflation storm, meme stocks, recession warnings, loads of data to process and make sense of every week and never-ending news cycle that always sound like we are an inch away from doomsday – all of this can be overwhelming and oftentimes disheartening for an average investor. But long-term investors tend to stick to their principles and ignore short-term market movements. But what if you don’t have any investing principles? After all not everyone out there is Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio. One of the best ways to get clarity in this age of volatility is to learn from the masters of the game. As Guy Spier, the legendary value investor, author of The Education of a Value Investor and manager of Aquamarine fund, says:Story continues""I read other managers’ letters. I look at the positions they own. The lists of portfolio securities that other managers own are very useful because it means the investment has already passed a very important filter. I think that whenever something in Seth Klarman’s portfolio is trading below the price that he paid for it, it is worthy of looking at, and at the same time, it performs another function. To get better at investing you want to study the moves of the masters.” Best Investments for BeginnersPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed all holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) and  Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). These two ETFs are considered ideal and safest choices for beginner investors by experts and Wall Street analysts. We sorted the holdings of these two funds by hedge fund sentiment, using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We picked 11 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. This way, we were able to pick the top investments in the stock market which are safe, less volatile and backed by smart money investors.Best Investments for Beginners11. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best investments for beginners, thanks to the company’s strong business model, diversified revenue streams and a safe dividend. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a potential breakout stock according to Wells Fargo. Recently the firm gave a list of mega-cap stocks that it believes have the potential to gain value and called them breakout stocks. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of these companies.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 111 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). The biggest stakeholder of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”10. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112While Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) might be out of the canvas in the AI race as Nvidia gets all the attention, the company has an impressive history of catching up to its competition quickly and behind the scenes AMD is launching full-throttle efforts to launch AI chips to compete with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO earlier this year landed in Taiwan to meet her team and to light a fire under the company’s AI efforts. According to media reports, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su said the high growth phase for AI will last 5-10 more years. She said that AI products market could hit $150 billion 3-5 years from now.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a long-term investment as the company slowly but surely gains market share in the AI chips industryAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The biggest stakeholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is being seen as an AI boom beneficiary as the CRM software company announced AI-related features for its CRM platform. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) also posted strong Q2 results and gave an upbeat guidance, after which several analysts praised the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives increased his price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $255.Ives wrote in a note to investors:""With the bears expecting a softer print this quarter with macro fears swirling heading into CRM earnings, Salesforce came out of the gates swinging featuring a Djokovic-like performance with a top and bottom-line beat and raise quarter driven by MuleSoft momentum and its overall subscription business further proving strength in the Beltway.”Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff, answering a question during the company’s Q2 earnings call, said the following about generative AI:“These are mostly predictive transactions, but we’re moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products, which we’ve now released to our customers. We’re very excited about the speed of our engineering organization and technology organization, our product organization and their ability to deliver customer value with generative AI.We have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we’re kind of now in a generative zone means that’s zone number two. But as you’re going to see at Dreamforce, zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven’t really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies, and that’s an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation and growth and to help our customers in all those areas. And then we’re eventually going to move into AGI and that will be the fourth area. And I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before. Because you’re going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more productivity, more capabilities, more augmentation of your employees, as I mentioned.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is generating all the buzz around the latest iPhone 15 as analysts are swooning over the company’s new products and their revenue potential. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently said in a report that iPhone 15 pre-orders are up between 10% and 12% year-over-year – as of the night of September 17, which is ""much stronger"" than Wall Street expected.""This is a clear positive for Apple with [average selling prices] set to be a major tailwind for Cupertino in this iPhone 15 cycle with our expectation of an ASP in the ~$925 range and up roughly $100 over the last 12-15 months given heavy Pro mix model shifts,"" Ives wrote in an investor note.Dan Ives has a $240 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He reiterated his forecast for 85 million iPhone unit production for this cycle.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is enjoying gains from the resilient consumer spending, as the company’s fiscal Q3 results show. Analysts believe Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) will gain even more once the economy turns the corner and consumer spending comes back to normal after inflation pressures cool.Commenting on fiscal Q3 results, Visa Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

The semiconductor giant plans to reveal two versions of the processor, according to leaked email conversations between Qualcomm and its partners, including Samsung (KS:005930). The documents were made public by South Korean blog gamma0burst on Monday.The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset will arrive in two variants, both manufactured under Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) process nodes. One will be produced using TSMC's 4nm N4P node, while the other, expected to be more powerful and energy-efficient, will use TSMC's enhanced 3nm N3E node.The two variants are anticipated to have the same CPU combination structure. However, there could be notable differences in performance and power efficiency due to the different manufacturing processes used. This combination includes ARM's latest Cortex X4, Cortex A720, and Cortex A520 CPU cores.Although both versions bear similar CPU combos, it remains uncertain whether they will be distinguished as non-Plus and Plus versions. This ambiguity arises from the fact that in 2022, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 with identical CPU combinations.The new processors are expected to offer improved efficiency and overheating prevention compared to their predecessors. The 3nm variant, in particular, is anticipated to be more powerful and energy-efficient due to its smaller feature set and transistors. Presently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s A17 Pro is the only other 3nm mobile chip globally.Unlike in 2022 when Qualcomm replaced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, the company plans to unveil both variants of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset simultaneously this year. The launch event is scheduled for October 24 at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii.As Qualcomm gears up for the release of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, it is expected to be a significant event for Android flagships in 2024. However, given past experiences, it could be an unpredictable journey for these flagships.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The tech giant is expected to introduce the flagship chipset next month at the Snapdragon Summit on October 24th.The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC is set to succeed the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, commonly found in flagship Android smartphones. The new SoC will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) using their 4nm process node, promising significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency.However, the leaked documents published by South Korea’s gamma0burst revealed a surprise: a second variant of the chipset. While both versions will feature the Cortex-X4 prime CPU core, Cortex-A720 performance CPU core, and Cortex-A520 efficiency CPU core, they differ in their production process. The primary variant will use TSMC's 4nm process node, while the second one will be manufactured using TSMC's N3E (enhanced) 3nm node.This shift to a smaller 3nm process node suggests a substantial leap in technological advancement. The smaller transistors in the 3nm variant allow for a denser configuration, potentially making this chipset even more powerful and energy-efficient compared to its 4nm counterpart.This strategy echoes Qualcomm's decision in 2022 when it replaced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, produced using Samsung (KS:005930)'s 4nm process, with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, built by TSMC on their own 4nm node. That move resulted in a remarkable 30% increase in efficiency and helped mitigate overheating issues.In a departure from previous patterns, Qualcomm is anticipated to unveil both variants of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 simultaneously at the Snapdragon Summit. While this event is likely to answer many questions about the new chipsets, it remains unclear whether the second variant will be named Snapdragon 8+ Gen 3 or if Qualcomm will choose a different designation.Story continuesDespite the identical configurations of both Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 variants, they differ only in the process node used for their construction. It should be noted that these announcements do not include the rumored Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, which is expected to be an overclocked version of the 4nm chip.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

There are cities in North America that can offer a taste of Europe. Before we look at the 14 most European cities in North America, let’s first take a look at the thriving travel and tourism market in North America.In one of our previous articles about most luxurious hotels, we briefly discussed how the hotel industry was one of the hardest hit during the peak of COVID-19 crisis. Similarly, the travel and tourism market also faced an unprecedented challenge when travel options were shut down and countries around the world imposed lockdowns during the outbreak of the virus. However, the post pandemic travel boom is now in full swing.North America's Growing Travel Market and Key PlayersAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the North American travel and tourism market was valued at around $1.96 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% during 2022-2027, pushing the market to reach above $2.5 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. The travel and tourism industry in North America consists of revenues generated by hotels, motels, food service and restaurants, as well as passenger airlines and passenger rail. The growing trend of transformational travel, which focuses on wellness, is expected to fuel market growth in North America. In recent years, a growing number of people have started traveling with the goal of healing, balancing, and transforming their mind, body, and spirit. In search of special and unique experiences of their own, travelers are planning their own journeys that mix entertainment and relaxation.To meet the growing travel demand and increase their profitability as well as market presence, major players in the travel and tourism market are innovating to offer more convenient and affordable options to travelers. On June 27, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) announced that Booking.com, which is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and one of the largest online travel agencies, will be launching a new AI Trip Planner in beta to a number of US travelers on its app. The AI trip planner will allow travelers to easily chat and ask travel-related questions to help them with any stage of their trip planning process. Users can get travel inspiration and create itineraries based on their needs and requirements, as well as check out potential destinations and accommodation options.Story continuesHere are some comments from Booking Holdings Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BKNG) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Built upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language model technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes. The AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they're interested in and then complete the reservation. Accretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations.”On August 3, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023, reflecting strong demand for travel despite high inflation. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $37.62, surpassing EPS estimates by $8.46. The company reported a revenue of $5.46 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $287.36 million.Similarly, the American travel technology company Expedia Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:EXPE), which owns and operates travel fare aggregators and travel metasearch engines like Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo, is offering users a new way to collaborate on their travels. With Trip Planner, exciting new tools and features will allow users to save and share their bookings and travel destinations with others.

Users can discover destinations and get access to better deals. The post also mentions that it is expected that Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) will be rolling out more tools and features by the end of the year.The growth of technology and digitization has led to a surge in online bookings as customers prefer and enjoy the convenience that mobile apps, travel websites, and online booking platforms are offering. This is expected to positively influence the travel market in the coming years. On the other hand, high inflation and political instability can hamper market growth. Severe weather conditions can also negatively influence the market. Some of the key players in the travel and tourism market include airlines, who may be forced to delay or cancel their flights. On September 14, Reuters reported that the CEO of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), Robert Jordan said at an investor conference that the company is prepared to deal with upcoming winter weather with “big investments” in de-icing capacity and new technology that helps understand weather conditions. The report also mentions that a massive winter storm in December last year crippled operations and forced Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) to cancel thousands of flights. This year, Robert Jordan believes that the company is very well prepared for the winters.Now that we have discussed some of the latest trends in the travel and tourism market as well as what some of the key market players are up to, let’s take a look at the 14 most European cities in North America.16 Most European Cities in North AmericaNeirfy/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of the 14 most European cities in North America using a consensus approach.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year.

75,550ebde8-f35d-3551-8002-2bc3ce9d65fa,PHM,2023-09-25,15 Cheapest Places to Buy a House in California,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-cheapest-places-buy-house-233358173.html,1695598438,STORY,"['LEN-B', 'PHM', 'LGIH']","[In this article, we will be studying the US housing industry. We will also be looking at the current industry scenario, some of the major home builders in this market, and the 15 cheapest places to buy a house in California. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Cheapest Places to Buy a House in California.American Housing Industry: An Overview:Housing is an important sector of the US economy. The US housing market comprises a diverse set of home buyers. First time buyers are typically young, usually looking for more affordable housing options. While move-up home buyers wish to upgrade their existing home to a better property, active adult buyers aged above 55 seek close-by amenities and low maintenance homes. Lastly, high-end buyers have a desire for luxury in their exclusive homes.On September 19, The US Census Bureau reported the current situation of residential construction in the country. In August, the monthly building permits for privately owned houses increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,543,000 while single family house permits were recorded at a rate of 949,000. However, the housing starts for both private and single-family houses declined from July to August in 2023.The Housing Industry Facing ChallengesThe housing industry in the United States is subject to various challenges as of now. In 2023, Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies published the State of the Nation’s Housing 2023 report. First time home buying reduced as the median home price in the US approached $3,000 per month in March 2023. People have also been spending a larger portion of their incomes on housing, experiencing a housing cost burden. The construction of affordable, medium sized homes also declined due to rising material and land costs for home builders. This housing shortage and increasing house ownership costs can be traced back to 2022. To counter the rising issues, different US states have been taking measures, for instance Montana and California legalized small-scale housing and duplexes in most neighborhoods. Indiana, South Dakota and Wyoming also allocated funds to start building entry level houses.Story continuesHousing in CaliforniaThe state of California alone has also been subject to a housing shortage as the supply of houses lags behind the demand. The housing production needs to be significantly increased in the state to cater to this supply-demand imbalance in housing. The supply shortage also leads to an increase in house prices and rents, leading to less affordability to own a house ultimately resulting in California being one of the poverty-ridden states in the US. Although these circumstances continue to prevail in California, the state also includes certain places where it is comparatively cheaper to purchase a house considering the low median home prices and rents in these areas.Housing Stocks to ConsiderThe dominant home builders in the housing industry include LGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Pulte Group, Inc. (NYSE:PHM).Based in Texas, LGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH) builds new constructions and housing developments. It is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States which guides its customers through the process of buying a house by discussing finances, current income and mortgage qualifications so the customer can understand what needs to be invested in a new house. The company claims to have fulfilled homeownership at affordable prices for 50,000 families. On September 18, the company reported that Terrata Homes, the luxury home division of the company,  has expanded to a new community ‘Bella Terra’ in the Tampa market. The needs of homebuyers in Tampa will now be fulfilled through high-end homes located in a natural setting. These homes offer buyers an opportunity to move in already, with prices starting above $670.Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) is another leading home construction company in the US. The company is involved in the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes. Residential areas are also sold directly by the company. The company sells homes in those communities which target first time, move-up, adult active, and high-end buyers. On September 14, the company reported strong earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $3.91 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.38. The company reported a revenue of $8.73 billion and beat revenue consensus by $213.39 million. On September 15, Reuters reported that the company’s strong earnings in the third quarter were due to an increasing demand for new construction powered by a shortage of homes in the market. In the same quarter, the company's home deliveries also rose by 8% year over year. The Co-CEO if the group, Jon Jaffe, elaborated on this success:""Our cycle time during the quarter was down 32 days sequentially as the improving supply chain and labor market positively impacted our production times""Pulte Group, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is also known for residential home construction in the US.  It operates in over 400 major cities in the country. Since existing homeowners in the US have been unwilling to re-sell their houses in a period of high interest rates, consumers are driven to purchase new homes thereby increasing demand for new construction by home builders like Pulte Group, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). On July 25, the company reported its financial results for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $3.00 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.46. The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.19 billion, ahead of revenue consensus by $164.28 million while the company's home sales revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.1 billion, up 8% year over year. The home sales revenue increased as a result of an increase in home closings and average sales price.Now that we have analyzed the US housing industry and what the dominant players such as LGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Pulte Group, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) are up to, we can move to the 15 cheapest places to buy a house in California.15 Cheapest Places to Buy a House in CaliforniaMobile homes in a manufactured home park.

Even as interest rates rise, investment in single-family homes rose from 12% of all real estate purchases to more than 20% in a few short months. As housing supply outpaces demand, a reversal from recent trends, rental property purchases will likely continue. Playing the rental market boom may seem impractical for those without a ton of cash on the sidelines. However, that isn’t the case. Some investment firms acquire rental properties and trade on public stock exchanges. Investors can choose from several stocks to capitalize on the rental market boom. The bottom line is that you don’t have to be a millionaire to capitalize on the rental market economy. Let’s take a look at three stocks that will benefit from an uptick in rental property prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvitation Homes (INVH)An image of two people with a housing contract, hands holding a pen, hands holding a calculator with a house in the backgroundSource: 89stocker / ShutterstockInvitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) owns more than 83,000 single-family rental (SFR) homes nationally. They generally target the “starter” segment, or those fresh out of school and beginning their first job. Invitation Homes offers a bridge between schooling and professional life as consumers settle. Invitation Homes capitalized on that trend as more professionals left school and entered the workforce right into a remote environment. Revenue growth exploded post-2020. Revenue grew by 3% year-over-year in 2020. In the following two years, revenue grew by 9.5% in 2021 and by 12.1% in 2022.Invitation Homes kept pace while maintaining margins (income was $195 million in 2020 but hit $437 million in the preceding 12 months). INVH is likely the best “pure play” for investors interested in playing the rental market boom. The stock also offers a modest 3% dividend to entice investor interest further.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockMid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) is an S&amp;P 500-listed real estate investment trust with more than 100,000 apartment home units in 16 states. Opening a position in MAA alongside INVH lets investors capture the biggest ends of the rental market: SFRs and individual apartments. Story continuesThe company’s success is evident in its dividend consistency, and the REIT either maintained or increased its dividend since 1994. The biggest dividend jumps came in recent years, particularly in 2022, on the heels of a strong rental market. That trend isn’t likely to die soon, and the company just announced its next dividend increase.  A risk to keep in mind is that rent prices will decline as inflation cools. Declining rent prices will cut into MAA’s bottom line. This makes MAA a slightly riskier play than a home-based rental market stock but still one to consider for your portfolio. Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMoving into a rental, or bouncing between rental homes, means that space is at a premium. This means that Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) is as well-positioned to take advantage of the rental market boom as any direct investment stock. Despite the strong position, EXR is down 11% this year. That drop makes EXR a cheap stock for those interested in capitalizing on rental market trends.If you’re turned off by recent market turbulence, EXR is also a stable stock. Its beta is just 0.57, meaning it moves less dramatically than the broader market. The company also issues a 2% dividend. Ultimately, due in part to the rental market boom, self-storage demand grew to more than 1.7 billion square feet this year. That bodes well for EXR’s core operations. As 20% of Americans currently use some form of self-storage and 15% more expect to in the near future, Extra Space Storage is ideal if you want to diversify your rental market investment portfolio.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no position in the securities mentioned.

Collectively, the funds are expected to provide more than 3 million meals to people in need, increase access to 1.88 million pounds of fresh produce, and save 21 million gallons of water and 2.89 tons of CO2e emissions in responsible food distribution, supporting better health and positively impacting the environment.Cigna Healthcare logo (PRNewsfoto/Cigna Healthcare)""Too many people in our country, including older adults, face challenges with food insecurity, which can lead to worsening health and vitality,"" said J.B. Sobel, M.D., chief medical officer for Cigna Healthcare's Medicare business. ""Older adults are more likely to have various health conditions requiring specific diets to maintain and improve their health. Regular, reliable, healthy food can improve the health and vitality of those we serve, and we are committed to giving each person the opportunity to live well.""Fifty-six innovative programs spanning 12 states received critical financial support enabling them to reach thousands of seniors who face food insecurity. The organizations range from local Meals on Wheels chapters and food banks to senior- and veteran-focused coalitions and centers. The sponsorships will also fund food- and nutrition-based programs, such as food pantries, mobile food deliveries, and nutritional meal boxes. Additionally, Cigna Healthcare is the first health benefits provider to exclusively sponsor The Farmlink Project, a nonprofit organization that connects farms with surplus harvest to communities around the United States. By connecting farmers to food banks, nutritious food is more accessible to those in need.""We are incredibly proud to be partnering with Cigna Healthcare to rescue millions of meals this season,"" said Aidan Reilly, co-founder and head of partnerships at The Farmlink Project. ""Access to fresh and healthy food is vital for anyone to reach their healthiest, fullest potential, yet millions of Americans struggle with food insecurity each year. Through this partnership, we will be able to provide access to fresh produce to families across the country throughout the fall and holiday seasons, a time when it is needed most.""Story continuesCurrently, one in 14 seniors face hunger in the United States, and six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, many exacerbated by unhealthy diets. These diet-related chronic diseases account for nearly 20% of all U.S. health care costs annually.Food insecurity is a barrier that impacts access to care and contributes to health inequities.

83,7f39adb3-256e-3e30-89e9-5e49189e1ab6,SWKS,2023-09-25,"What Does Skyworks Solutions, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SWKS) Share Price Indicate?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-skyworks-solutions-inc-nasdaq-105648709.html,1695639408,STORY,['SWKS'],"[Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$115 and falling to the lows of US$96.28. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Skyworks Solutions' current trading price of US$96.42 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Is Skyworks Solutions Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Skyworks Solutions is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Skyworks Solutions’s ratio of 14.77x is below its peer average of 24.78x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Semiconductor industry. What’s more interesting is that, Skyworks Solutions’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Skyworks Solutions generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 45%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SWKS is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SWKS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SWKS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Tuesday and Friday will bring consumer sentiment checks from the Conference Board and the University of Michigan, respectively, while housing data and an update on quarterly economic growth also dot the schedule.On the earnings side, along with results from Nike and Costco, Carnival (CCL) and Micron (MU) will be key highlights.Elsewhere in corporate news, two labor disputes are ongoing as the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike enters its third week without a deal, and talks have heated up between Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) amid a four-month-long work stoppage.Stocks enter the week looking to bounce back from another down week. Last Wednesday featured the Fed's persistence on a ""higher for longer"" strategy with interest rates spawned a sell-off. Over the last five trading sessions, the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) slipped nearly 3% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 3.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) dropped almost 2%.After the Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted in a press conference that inflation remains ""well above the longer-run goal of 2%.""The Summary of Economic Projections showed inflation ending 2023 lower than officials had previously thought, however. The SEP indicated the Federal Reserve sees core inflation finishing at 3.7% this year — lower than June's projection of 3.9% — before cooling to 2.6% next year and 2.3% in 2025.Story continuesThose projections will be put to the test once again this week. Data on Friday is expected to show ""core"" PCE — which strips out the costs of food and energy — rose 3.9% over the prior year in August, down from a 4.2% increase in July. The Fed targets 2% inflation, on average. Over the prior month, ""core"" PCE is expected to rise 0.2% in August, unchanged from July.Wells Fargo's economics team agrees with the consensus projection for 0.2% month-over-month growth but believes the mounting headwinds facing the consumer could eventually force an economic slowdown.""If our forecasts are correct, real personal consumption expenditures will continue a 12-month streak of growth,"" Wells Fargo's team of economists wrote in a research note on Friday. ""That said, the loosening labor market, less marked improvement in inflation and resumption of student loan payments are headwinds to real PCE in the coming months. Consumer confidence, which we forecast declined to 105.7 in August [from 106.1 in July], should give an early read next week as to how consumers are faring in this kind of environment.""Data for new home sales and the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price index are expected on Tuesday. Economists project new home sales fell 2.2% month over month.As the data comes in, expect Wall Street to discuss if another rate hike, which the Fed projected on Wednesday, will be needed. As of Friday, investors aren't betting on it, as futures markets have just a 37% percent chance a rate hike happens by the end of the December meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. ""Even with the more hawkish dots we’re still comfortable thinking that the hiking cycle is over,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note on Wednesday. ""We would be getting more concerned about the Committee walking into the policy mistake of overtightening if it weren’t for the fact that the more influential members are likely less hawkish than the median dot.""On the corporate side, the auto sector will remain in focus as strikes continue at plants operated by the Big Three automakers Stellantis (STLA), GM (GM), and Ford (F).On Friday, the UAW intensified the stoppages, expanding the strikes to 38 more locations across 20 states. Thus far, auto stocks have had mixed reactions with GM the biggest loser, falling roughly 4% over the past week.Ford's stock rallied on Friday as UAW president Shawn Fain noted the union had made “real progress” with Ford over the past week.“The UAW strike is about to get a lot nastier which could have a massive impact on GM's EV plans as well as billions of lost revenue/production depending how long this UAW debacle lasts,” Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives wrote after the UAW press briefing on Friday.Meanwhile, an earnings report from Nike could also have implications across multiple companies in the retail sector. Wall Street analysts project Nike’s earnings per share to decrease about 20% from the same period a year prior to $0.75 while revenues are expected to top $13 billion, a 2.5% increase from a year ago, per data complied by Bloomberg.When the retail giant reports Thursday after the bell, investors will be keenly focused not only on what Nike says about itself and the state of the consumer but also other key areas of retail. Nike will provide a look at a continued consumer slowdown in China, the health of the wholesale market, which some have said is under pressure, and perhaps an update on retail crime.“Global business trends have likely been slightly worse than expected, but this is probably already priced into the stock and contemplated in the lower-end of Nike's FY24 guidance range,” UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note to clients previewing the earnings announcement. “We believe the 'bar' for the event is a 1Q EPS beat, offset by a below-consensus Q2 guide, with Nike's FY24 outlook remaining unchanged. Our view is Nike will meet this bar.”A Nike Air Vapor football is seen on the field before an NCAA football game on Saturday, Sept. 16, 2023, in Morgantown, W. Va.

""Overall, it is unlikely to have a material impact on Q4 GDP, but it does come at a time when we think the economy will be shrinking.""From a stock perspective, the shutdown could likely bring choppiness, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told clients in a note earlier this week. But that doesn't mean it will bring doom.""Government shutdowns tend to be high profile though low-impact market events,"" Lerner wrote. ""While uncertainty around these events tends to heighten investor angst and add to short-term market volatility, the historical evidence suggests a minimal lasting market impact.""Weekly calendarMondayEconomic data: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, September (-13 expected, -17.2 previously)Earnings: No notable earnings.TuesdayEconomic data: New home sales, August (699,000 annualized rate expected, 714,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, August (-2.2% expected, +4.4% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, September (105.5 expected, 106.1 previously); S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, July (+0.65% expected, +0.92% previously); S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, July (+0.03% expected, -1.17% previously)Earnings: Costco (COST)WednesdayEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Sept. 22 (+5.4% prior); Durable goods, August (-0.5% expected, -5.2% previously)Earnings: Duckhorn (NAPA), Jefferies Financial Group (JEF), Micron (MU)ThursdayEconomic data: Second quarter GDP, third estimate (+2.2% annualized rate expected, +2.1% previously); Second quarter personal consumption, third estimate (+1.7% expected, 1.7% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ended Sept. 24 (215,000 expected, 201,000 previously); Pending home sales month-over-month, August (-1.0% expected, 0.9% previously)Earnings: BlackBerry (BB), CarMax (KMX), Nike (NKE), Vail Resorts (MTN)FridayEconomic data: Wholesale inventories month-over-month, August (-0.2% expected, -0.2% previously); Retail inventories month-over-month, August (+0.5% expected, +0.3% previously) Personal income, month-over-month, August (+0.4% expected, +0.2% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, August (+0.4% expected, +0.8% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, August (+0.5% expected, +0.2% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, August (+3.4% expected, +3.2% previously); ""Core"" PCE, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); ""Core"" PCE, year-over-year, August (+3.9% expected; +4.2% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, August, final reading (67.7 expected, 67.7 previously)Earnings: Carnival (CCL)Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency market, you can go directly to see 5 Most Searched Cryptocurrencies in 2023.The Cryptocurrency Market BoomCryptocurrency is a founding stone that brought the evolution of blockchain technology and then led to the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Web3, and the metaverse. A big milestone for the cryptocurrency market was achieved when Bitcoin (BTC) touched the $1,000 mark on November 27, 2013. Earlier in 2013, Bitcoin (BTC) was added as a word to the Oxford English Dictionary, which defined Bitcoin as “a digital currency in which transactions can be performed without the need for a central bank.” Bitcoin (BTC) started to get wider recognition worldwide when the price of BTC almost touched $20,000 in December 2017. The 2017 cryptocurrency market boom changed everything in the world of digital currency. The crypto bull market started in May 2017, when Bitcoin’s price soared over $2,000 for the first time and crossed $3,000 just a few weeks later. At that time, the market forces also showed subsequent turbulence, including BTC’s price dropping by $300 within one hour of the trading session on June 12, 2017. However, the market forces kept the Bitcoin price on the rise. Perhaps one of the major developments was the Wall Street analysts entering the BTC price analysis game. Goldman Sachs analyst Sheba Jafari predicted Bitcoin to cross $3,600 which further led to forecasts from other notable analysts. Bitcoin reached the $20,000 price mark on December 17, 2017, making history in the cryptocurrency market. A few days later, a drop of 30% wiped off billions of dollars from the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, making it one of the biggest market corrections in history. Since then, cryptocurrency has been a highly volatile market with massive pumps and dumps, subsequently. Story continuesCrypto Market OutlookIf we look at the one-year movement of Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto deity is following an upward trend. The crypto market follows the trend of Bitcoin as it still leads the market sentiment. On August 25, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou mentioned that there is some positive sentiment building around the crypto market based on open interest in CME Bitcoin futures contracts. Based on that, Panigirtzoglou believes that there is a limited downside for crypto markets over the near term. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade at about 60% above since the start of 2023, surpassing other well-performing assets like technology stocks. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around the $26,700 price mark, as of 6:23 a.m. Eastern Time on September 21. At the same time, BTC is almost up by 40% over the last 12 months. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto asset, is trading at $1,608, up by 20% over the last 12 months. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization on coinmarketcap.com stands at $1.06 trillion, with Bitcoin’s dominance of 49.2% and Ethereum’s dominance of 18.3%, at the time of writing on September 21. The cryptocurrency market has continuously grown despite the regulatory and market upheavals. Crypto is getting more adoption with its existence in the NFTs, Web3, and the metaverse. According to a study from IMARC Group, the global cryptocurrency market size touched $2 trillion in 2022 and it is expected to reach $4 trillion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% between 2023 and 2028. Cryptocurrency for BusinessesToday, cryptocurrencies are widely used for business and merchant payments. According to Deloitte, 2,353 U.S. businesses accept Bitcoin, as per an estimate in late 2022. That excludes the use of Bitcoin ATMs. Global companies are also accepting the use of Bitcoin and other top currencies for investment, operational, and transactional purposes. Some of the leading companies that accept Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) - to name a few. For instance, Elon Musk has an immense involvement in the crypto market. Musk has been a great admirer of cryptocurrencies and his companies hold a large portion of Bitcoins. As of the second quarter of 2023, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) held digital assets worth $184 billion, which has remained the same for the past three quarters. Apart from that, the world’s largest asset management firm BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has filed for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has delayed the ruling until the start of 2024. If BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) gets the regulatory approval for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will become the first company to hold the first crypto spot ETF in the U.S. The crypto industry has created new spaces for companies to enter the market such as crypto exchanges, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), crypto mining, crypto wallets, crypto lending, smart contract platforms, and crypto ATMs, among others. Cryptocurrency exchanges have played a great role in taking digital assets to the masses, helped by crypto payment platforms. According to coinmarketcap.com, the three largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume include Binance, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), and Kraken. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has a large audience in the U.S. market. Being one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has created a massive impact on the adoption of cryptocurrencies. On September 19, Coinbase Global, Inc.

According to Coinbase Global, Inc., almost 52 million Americans own crypto assets, which means every 1 in 5 adults own a crypto asset.

(NASDAQ:COIN) along with Framework Ventures has invested $5 million in Socket, a protocol aiming to enhance blockchain communication. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) shares have soared by almost 110% year-to-date, as of September 21. Moving forward, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a notable company in the crypto space.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) payment platform. Now that we have discussed what is happening in the crypto market, let's take a look at the 20 most searched cryptocurrencies in 2023.20 Most Searched Cryptocurrencies in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our methodology, we sourced the 50 cryptocurrencies with the highest trading volume as of September 23.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

It was not immediately clear if main table bargaining took place with GM and Stellantis over the weekend.The UAW began unprecedented, simultaneous strikes on Sept. 15 at one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three after the prior four-year labor deals expired. The strikes at additional GM and Stellantis facilities on Friday added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 previously on strike.UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still had serious issues to resolve.The Detroit Three automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40% along with 32-hour-work weeks, the return of defined benefit pensions and to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees.President Joe Biden will travel to Michigan Tuesday to show support for workers and visit a UAW picket line, while Donald Trump who is seeking a new term as president will speak in Clinton Township, Michigan Wednesday about the UAW strike.GM said last week it was forced to idle its Kansas car plant because of a parts shortage stemming from the strike, which led it to temporarily furlough 2,000 workers in Kansas. Stellantis temporarily laid off 68 employees in Ohio last week and expects to furlough another 300 workers in Indiana because of the strike.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide PNC Financial Services Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. PNC Financial Services Group's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 47%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of PNC Financial Services Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. PNC Financial Services Group reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.Story continuesYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.While PNC Financial Services Group insiders did net US$1.2m selling stock over the last year, they invested US$1.4m, a much higher figure. An optimistic sign for those with PNC Financial Services Group in their watchlist. It is also worth noting that it was Chairman William Demchak who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$1.0m, paying US$153 per share.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for PNC Financial Services Group is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$181m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of PNC Financial Services Group but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does PNC Financial Services Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?PNC Financial Services Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. To make matters even better, the company insiders who know the company best have put their faith in the its future and have been buying more stock. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe PNC Financial Services Group deserves timely attention.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to Reddit.US stock markets were wavering after latest inflation data showed pricing pressures are returning, albeit due to rising oil prices. Despite the ifs and buts, it’s clear that the Fed has not been able to get the results it wanted (so far) with its persistent rate hikes. Investors were too early to cheer the start of the bull market. The Fed could very well begin another set of rate hikes, and even if it holds back on rate hikes for now the first half of 2024 could be jittery for the stock market. But stock markets have always been like this; always moving on news cycles and investors always looking over their shoulder for that next important data point and report. If we zoom out, though, we will notice that stock markets tend to move upwards in the long run and investors who give up too early and sell based on news cycles end up losing most of those sweet gains.A report by MFS Investment Management analyzed data provided by FactSet and S&amp;P which consist of stock market movements and returns starting from the end of 2002 to the end of 2022. The report analyzes the returns on an initial hypothetical investment of $10,000 during the period. If you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 in December 2002 and had stayed invested (that’s the most important part here), your initial investment would have grown to a whopping $64,844 by the end of 2022. But if you had missed just 30 “best days” you’d get only $11,702. If you’d missed out on 20 best days you’d get $17,826 according to the report. Notice the huge differences in returns as you increase the number of days invested. This is the power of staying invested in the stock market and not giving in to the news cycles that always paint a doom and gloom scenario for investors.Lessons from Mohnish PabraiMohnish Pabrai, one of the notable value investors, talked about some golden rules of value investing and what he learned from legendary value investors like Warren Buffett in an interview with Sum Zero. Pabrai said that there are more opportunities for investors when the market is going through pessimism as compared to times when the market is in euphoria. Pabrai also talked about our biases and mistakes investors make. He said:Story continues“Even if I look at the United States with its 3500 some odd publicly traded businesses, an investment manager can really not drill down on more than a few dozen of them every year. So they have to make a decision relatively quickly on which ones they are or are not going to focus on. Commitment bias that comes in once we start spending time on something, our brains play games with us. One of the games our brain plays is that we feel entitled. “Hey, if I spent some time on it, I ought to make money on it”. And that’s really not how investing works. I think it’s very important to be aware of commitment bias, and to be very aware that the first two or three minutes that when you’re looking at a company are when you have to make the call. It’s okay to let a winner go, but more important not to let a loser stay.”Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to RedditPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article we scoured several Reddit subreddits like Investing, StockMarket, Stocks, Wall Street Bets, among others, to see which stocks Redditors believe will rebound from their lows in the future. We picked only those stocks that are down year to date or over the past 12 months with a positive sentiment on Reddit. Redditors either believe these companies are undervalued or the selloff around them is overdone. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors around each stock.Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to Reddit10. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) shares have lost about 40% over the past one year. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is one of the top lithium stocks loved by Redditors and many on the platform believe the stock is offering a good entry point for the long term.Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is currently on investors’ radar after reports said an estimated 20 to 40 million tonnes of lithium reserves are found near the company’s Thacker Pass project.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC).Massif Capital made the following comment about Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the first quarter, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) had several positive events, including a favorable record of decision ruling for Thacker Pass, paving the way for construction of the mine to start, a revised Thacker resource/cost estimates, and GM’s financing/offtake agreement. Even though LAC is non-producing and its stock is down 34% over the past year (compared to the larger lithium producer’s 3%), the stock remains one of our favorites with multiple catalysts (and still up roughly 600% from our initial purchase price):As Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina and Thacker Pass come online, volumes will effectively be marked at leading-edge pricing. As such, it seems prudent to continue underwriting growth, especially given the firm’s experienced management team with a visible pipeline to incremental supply before 2025. These qualities make one or both post-separation entities attractive buyout targets for numerous suitors…” (Please click here to read the full text)9. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Clothing company Levi Strauss shares fell sharply in July after the company cut its FY23 revenue growth guidance range and also decreased its FY23 profit guidance by 15%.In the second quarter, Levi Strauss's adjusted EPS came in at $0.04 beating estimates by $0.01.  Revenue in the period came in at $1.34 billion, meeting estimates.LEVI has a PE ratio of 12.40 as of September 13. Levi’s is also a strong dividend payer, with an over 3% yield. Redditors believe the stock can rebound when inflation pressures subside and the consumer will have confidence and buying power to boost their spending.Talking about the future the company said the following in its latest earnings call:“Driven by our ongoing execution in surgical pricing action U.S. wholesale will stabilize and end the year as a smaller share of our business at less than 30%. Inventories are expected to end 2023 below prior year levels. Our 2023 gross margin is expected to remain 300 basis points higher than 2019 and we will exit the year with Q4 EBIT margins north of 12%. And importantly, we continue to return cash to our shareholders with a payout ratio of 150% of free-cash flow substantially higher than our targeted 55% to 65% communicated at our Investor Day. Lastly, while we are lowering our H2 outlook because of U.S. wholesale, we expect the strong growth in our large fast growing DTC and international businesses to continue, which as U.S. wholesale stabilizes and COGS improves will position our unique business model to generate significant financial leverage beyond 2023.”8. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Metals and mining company Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)’s stock has lost about 16% year to date through September 13. Redditors believe Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) can rebound. One Redditor, for example, said in a stock discussion thread:“Im waiting on VALE to catch a low. Its in the murky cross over of an up swing. Looking to hold for a few months for roughly a 25% gain. If it runs to what it did after covid, ~55%. I've got a buy limit order in, hopefully penny pinching doesn't hurt me while I'm gone on a week vacation.”Earlier this month, J.P. Morgan upgraded Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) from Neutral. JPMorgan said the stock is undervalued when compared to its peers.“Current iron ore prices are being supported by improved sentiment on China reopening and robust steel output. Current valuation looks discounted as the stock has de-rated, currently down 27.2% year-to-date, and has been outperformed by iron ore,” JPMorgan’s Rodolfo Angele said.Miller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shares are down about 16% year to date. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) suffered a backlash from customers earlier this year after it showcased LGBT merchandize at its stores. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) later moved this LGBT-focused merchandize from “the front of the stores to the back” in some stores.In August Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) posted second quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.80 beating estimates by $0.38. Revenue in the period came in at $24.77 billion, missing estimates by $460 million.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”6. Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) ranks 6th in our list of stocks that will bounce back according to Reddit. Recently, BMO Capital mentioned a list of stocks that have grown at a “reasonable price.” Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) was part of the list with an Outperform rating set by BMO.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH). The biggest stakeholder of Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $103 million stake in the company.Here is what Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund has to say about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy provides solar microinverters and energy storage solutions. The company’s shares lagged benchmark counterparts amid concerns surrounding a near-term moderation in the growth of residential solar installation in the United States. Despite this, the company possesses a market-leading position in its core microinverter product and remains wellpositioned over the long term to benefit from ongoing solar adoption trends. Additionally, Enphase is focused on growing its international presence while also unveiling new products that could provide the next tailwind to its growth story.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to Reddit. Suggested articles:12 Best Large-Cap Value ETFs12 Best Small-Cap Value ETFs10 Best Quant ETFsDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to Reddit is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$845m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 15% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market movers"", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Regions Financial which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Regions Financial. View our latest analysis for Regions Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Regions Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Regions Financial. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Regions Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Regions Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.7% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Regions FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Regions Financial Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$47m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Regions Financial. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis and proceed directly to the top 5 Countries that Hand Golden Visas Out.With the growing desire for mobility and opportunities among high net worth individuals (HNWIs), many governments worldwide have implemented ""Golden Visa"" programs. Such initiatives provide a pathway to residency or citizenship by investment.What are Golden Visas?A Golden Visa grants individuals and their families the freedom to live, work, and study in a foreign country. The primary goal of issuing a Golden Visa is to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth. By offering residency through a Golden Visa, countries aim to attract HNWIs, entrepreneurs, and investors who can contribute to the local economy by creating jobs, injecting capital, and driving technological advancements.What does a Golden Visa do? The global recognition of Golden Visas stems from the multitude of benefits they offer. Investors can expand their wealth portfolio, enjoy a higher standard of living, and explore new business and investment opportunities. For host nations, Golden Visas attract foreign capital, drive economic growth, and foster cross-cultural exchanges. These initiatives are available in various countries, each with its own set of eligibility criteria, investment requirements, and advantages. Some programs lead to permanent residency, while others offer a path to full citizenship.Golden Visa BenefitsOnce the Golden Visa is granted, HNWIs and their families can gain various benefits depending on the program. These may include residency rights, access to healthcare and education, tax advantages, and the option to apply for permanent residency or citizenship in the future.According to the Get Golden Visa whitepaper published in Q2 2022, there are several compelling reasons why Americans are exploring to move outside of the United States. These motivations include a desire to obtain a second passport, seek out captivating historical and cultural experiences, escape social and political unrest, distance themselves from what they perceive as a discouraging ‘American mindset’, alleviate high living expenses, pursue investment opportunities, secure vacation homes, plan for retirement, achieve a better work-life balance, and access potential tax benefits.Story continuesThe engagement statistics from their research provide valuable insights into the primary reasons driving Americans to seek second residency options, with the following key findings: 42% are driven by concerns about social and political unrest within the US, 29% are motivated by the escalating living costs in the US, 10% aspire to acquire a second passport from a European country, 8% are actively seeking profitable investment opportunities, 6% are pursuing a significant life change, and 5% are strategically planning for retirement abroad.Golden Visas Demand Surge Amid Mounting ConcernsBloomberg's report, on August 15, highlighted the growing uncertainty surrounding the future of Golden Visa programs. Members of the European Parliament and Commission, in conjunction with the United Kingdom and Ireland, are collectively advocating for the termination of EU Golden Visa programs.The primary concern lies in the potential misuse of these programs by individuals with criminal backgrounds or corrupt influential figures. The UK and Ireland have already terminated their Golden Visa program, Greece increased the investment threshold in some regions to €500,000 (approximately $540,000) from €250,000 (approximately $270,000), Montenegro committed to discontinuing its program, and Spain is considering raising the minimum investment to €1 million (approximately $1.1 million) or eliminating it altogether. Despite these efforts, demand for Golden Visas continues to rise.In reciprocation, the call for a shutdown has yielded positive results for immigration consultancies. For instance, the London-based firm Get Golden Visa saw a remarkable 127% increase in inquiries about Portuguese and Greek Golden Visas during the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year. Moreover, there has been a significant uptick in the number of individuals moving forward with the application process. Government statistics show that Portugal experienced a significant surge in the number of Golden Visas granted in May, reaching a multi-year high of 180. In Greece, this number also witnessed a substantial increase, reaching 412, marking an 87% rise compared to the previous year.According to the Knight Frank’s Wealth Report, 17th edition 2023, 13% of individuals classified as ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) are exploring the possibility of obtaining a second passport or citizenship. The report defines UHNWIs as those whose net worth exceeds $30 million. Moreover, 16% of UHNWI clients in Asia, 15% in the US, and 12% in the Middle East are currently considering the acquisition of a Golden Visa or a similar immigration status. This segment of the population is just “the tip of the iceberg,” as ""wealth and talent are on the move"".Additionally, the report notes that the newly acquired wealth will be used by investors for different purposes. Some aim for making their money grow (31% of respondents), while others want to keep it safe (26%), and some want to generate income (23%). A rise in investment allocations is anticipated, as nearly one-third of investors are considering property investments as a means to safeguard against inflation and diversify their portfolios.Now that we’ve discussed what Golden Visas are and its intricacies, let's move on to discuss the countries that hand them out.What Are Golden Visas and 10 Countries that Hand Them Out?MethodologyTo explore the topic 'what are Golden Visas and 10 countries that hand them out?’, we engaged with a range of immigration firms including IMI Daily, Immigrant Invest, Migrate World, Global Citizen Solutions, Guide Consultants, and Hubbis to ascertain the countries offering Golden Visa programs and their investment costs. Our assessment involved ranking these visas according to their respective investment thresholds, with the most cost-effective option securing the top position.10 Countries that Hand Golden Visas Out10. IndonesiaGolden Visa Investment: $2.5 MillionIndonesia ranks 10th on our list of Golden Visa countries. As per the recently introduced program, individual investors have the opportunity to obtain a five-year residence permit by establishing a company and committing a minimum investment of $2.5 million. To be eligible for a 10-year permit, the investment requirement is raised to $5 million. On the other hand, corporate investors are subject to a distinct set of criteria. Directors and commissioners aiming for a 5-year residence permit must establish a company with a minimum investment of $25 million. For a 10-year permit, the investment threshold increases to $50 million.9. Saudi ArabiaGolden Visa Investment: $1.05 MillionSaudi Arabia's Golden Visa program commands attention with its substantial minimum investment of $1.05 million, positioning it as one of the more exclusive options in the Golden Visa countries’ 2023 landscape. This program provides two distinct residency paths: a one-year renewable option suitable for those with temporary connections, enabling employment in the private sector, and a pricier permanent residency choice that grants extended stay privileges for both the primary cardholder and their family.8. UAEGolden Visa Investment: $545,000The UAE Golden Visa offers long-term residence in the UAE, granting the freedom to live, work, or study in the country while enjoying a host of exclusive privileges. This visa is available for either 5 or 10 years, depending on the applicant's category, and can be easily renewed under the same conditions. Holders of this visa can travel outside the UAE for extended periods, exceeding six months, without jeopardizing their resident status, and sponsor their family members too.7. SpainGolden Visa Investment: $525,000By investing in the Spanish economy, whether it involves purchasing real estate, investing in public debt, acquiring shares, or initiating a business project, individuals are granted access to the Spain Golden Visa program. Initially, this visa is valid for one year, with the possibility of renewal for two or five years, contingent upon the scale of your investment. After maintaining continuous residence for five years, applicants become eligible to apply for permanent residency, and after a decade, citizenship becomes an option too.6. TaiwanGolden Visa Investment: $450,000The Taiwan Golden Visa is a permanent residence visa for foreign investors and skilled professionals looking to live and work in Taiwan. It comes with benefits like no minimum stay requirement, access to public healthcare and education, family sponsorship, and the possibility of naturalization after five years. There are two main applicant categories: investors who invest a minimum of NT$ 15 million (approximately $530,000) in a Taiwanese company or project, and professionals with a master's degree or higher who earn at least NT$ 160,000 (approximately $5,600) per month.Click to continue reading and see the top 5 Countries that Hand Golden Visas Out.Suggested Articles:15 Cheapest CBI Programs in 2023 20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202350 Most Spoken Languages in the WorldDisclosure: None.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Investments for Beginners.Investors remain skeptic on the economy’s ability to completely avoid a recession. Last month equities saw a selloff driven by persistent inflation, weak jobs report and China’s economic woes. Analysts believe the Fed’s battle against inflation still has a long way to go and recession could hit the economy in the first half of 2024. Some circles however voice a lot of optimism on the back of solid state of the consumer in the US. While inflation worried some segments of the market, the bulls say the latest uptick in inflation was caused by higher energy prices. Consumer spending in the US remains strong despite the hammering households have taken due to inflation over the past several months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the “fear gauge” of the Wall Street, recently fell to its lowest point since the pandemic. VIX shows the market’s expectation of volatility based on S&amp;P 500 index options.For beginner investors with low risk appetite and limited budgets, the current market environment may seem like a chaos. Inflation storm, meme stocks, recession warnings, loads of data to process and make sense of every week and never-ending news cycle that always sound like we are an inch away from doomsday – all of this can be overwhelming and oftentimes disheartening for an average investor. But long-term investors tend to stick to their principles and ignore short-term market movements. But what if you don’t have any investing principles? After all not everyone out there is Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio. One of the best ways to get clarity in this age of volatility is to learn from the masters of the game. As Guy Spier, the legendary value investor, author of The Education of a Value Investor and manager of Aquamarine fund, says:Story continues""I read other managers’ letters. I look at the positions they own. The lists of portfolio securities that other managers own are very useful because it means the investment has already passed a very important filter. I think that whenever something in Seth Klarman’s portfolio is trading below the price that he paid for it, it is worthy of looking at, and at the same time, it performs another function. To get better at investing you want to study the moves of the masters.” Best Investments for BeginnersPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed all holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) and  Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). These two ETFs are considered ideal and safest choices for beginner investors by experts and Wall Street analysts. We sorted the holdings of these two funds by hedge fund sentiment, using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We picked 11 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. This way, we were able to pick the top investments in the stock market which are safe, less volatile and backed by smart money investors.Best Investments for Beginners11. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best investments for beginners, thanks to the company’s strong business model, diversified revenue streams and a safe dividend. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a potential breakout stock according to Wells Fargo. Recently the firm gave a list of mega-cap stocks that it believes have the potential to gain value and called them breakout stocks. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of these companies.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 111 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). The biggest stakeholder of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”10. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112While Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) might be out of the canvas in the AI race as Nvidia gets all the attention, the company has an impressive history of catching up to its competition quickly and behind the scenes AMD is launching full-throttle efforts to launch AI chips to compete with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO earlier this year landed in Taiwan to meet her team and to light a fire under the company’s AI efforts. According to media reports, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su said the high growth phase for AI will last 5-10 more years. She said that AI products market could hit $150 billion 3-5 years from now.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a long-term investment as the company slowly but surely gains market share in the AI chips industryAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The biggest stakeholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is being seen as an AI boom beneficiary as the CRM software company announced AI-related features for its CRM platform. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) also posted strong Q2 results and gave an upbeat guidance, after which several analysts praised the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives increased his price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $255.Ives wrote in a note to investors:""With the bears expecting a softer print this quarter with macro fears swirling heading into CRM earnings, Salesforce came out of the gates swinging featuring a Djokovic-like performance with a top and bottom-line beat and raise quarter driven by MuleSoft momentum and its overall subscription business further proving strength in the Beltway.”Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff, answering a question during the company’s Q2 earnings call, said the following about generative AI:“These are mostly predictive transactions, but we’re moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products, which we’ve now released to our customers. We’re very excited about the speed of our engineering organization and technology organization, our product organization and their ability to deliver customer value with generative AI.We have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we’re kind of now in a generative zone means that’s zone number two. But as you’re going to see at Dreamforce, zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven’t really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies, and that’s an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation and growth and to help our customers in all those areas. And then we’re eventually going to move into AGI and that will be the fourth area. And I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before. Because you’re going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more productivity, more capabilities, more augmentation of your employees, as I mentioned.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is generating all the buzz around the latest iPhone 15 as analysts are swooning over the company’s new products and their revenue potential. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently said in a report that iPhone 15 pre-orders are up between 10% and 12% year-over-year – as of the night of September 17, which is ""much stronger"" than Wall Street expected.""This is a clear positive for Apple with [average selling prices] set to be a major tailwind for Cupertino in this iPhone 15 cycle with our expectation of an ASP in the ~$925 range and up roughly $100 over the last 12-15 months given heavy Pro mix model shifts,"" Ives wrote in an investor note.Dan Ives has a $240 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He reiterated his forecast for 85 million iPhone unit production for this cycle.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the best investments in the stock market for beginners. Recently, Jefferies upped its price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from $460.00 to $475.00. With over a decade of dividend increases and a dominance in the payment processing industry Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a safe choice in an otherwise volatile market.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 139 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) was Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management $2.31 billion.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is enjoying gains from the resilient consumer spending, as the company’s fiscal Q3 results show. Analysts believe Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) will gain even more once the economy turns the corner and consumer spending comes back to normal after inflation pressures cool.Commenting on fiscal Q3 results, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) CEO Ryan McInerney said that “consumer spending remained resilient, driving growth in payments volume and processed transactions.”Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 171 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Visa Inc.

109,6797336f-8ee7-3ee8-917a-f1f734a352b3,APH,2023-09-25,Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-amphenol-corporation-110024838.html,1695639624,STORY,['APH'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$88.88 and falling to the lows of US$80.19. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amphenol's current trading price of US$83.33 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amphenol’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Amphenol What's The Opportunity In Amphenol?The stock is currently trading at US$83.33 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 20% compared to my intrinsic value of $69.19. This means that the opportunity to buy Amphenol at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Amphenol’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Amphenol look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 16% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Amphenol. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in APH’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe APH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for APH, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Amphenol mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

110,31077dcb-28f8-3bae-ae87-20ac03069f64,MAR,2023-09-25,Marriott to Hold First Investor Day Since 2019: What to Expect From the Hotel Giant,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-hold-first-investor-day-060000187.html,1695621600,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott will broadcast its Wednesday, September 27, “Security Analyst Meeting” live (details here). It’ll be the first such presentation the world’s largest hotelier has given since 2019.The company has a few goals.Executives want to give analysts a deeper understanding of the company’s fundamentals.They want to showcase the company’s management team and its strategic vision.They hope to create buzz about Marriott among investors.Expect to hear some updates on how Marriott’s hotels have performed since August 1, when it reported earnings.The day will have its limitations.It’s unlikely Marriott will share any groundbreaking information not already contained in its financial filings.Expect to see charts of the company’s modeling that suggest possibilities rather than forecasts.For instance, expect to see charts with potential three-year ranges for net room growth and revenue per available room (essentially a measure of gross revenue coming in).The last Investor Day presentation starred CEO Arne Sorenson, who died in 2021. Reading the transcript from 2019 is a sad reminder of his loss.Robin Farley of UBS Research said one figure she will closely watch will be revenue per available room (RevPAR).The consensus of all investment analysts is that Marriott will show 2% revenue per available room growth next year and 3% growth in 2025. Will management guide analysts to that, or coming in lower or higher?“Our regression model suggests U.S. RevPAR growth of +1% in 2024, and we have Marriott a little ahead of that at +2% in 2024,” Farley wrote.“We are a little more conservative in our 2025 estimate for RevPAR at +1%, given the macro uncertainty at the moment,” she wrote. “But we believe that a low single-digit range for RevPAR guidance after 2023 would be in line with investor expectations, and a more aggressive piece of guidance could actually be taken negatively if investors were to view it as too optimistic.”Story continuesConor Cunningham at Melius Research is eyeing net room growth. Gross fees from franchise and management contracts represented three-quarters of Marriott’s net revenues over the past year. So each net room at a quality property that Marriott adds should contribute incrementally to the bottom line. So, net room growth is a good proxy for overall earnings growth.The broader Marriott’s footprint becomes, the more valuable its loyalty program becomes, too. That’s because consumers are more likely to be repeat customers if Marriott always has a place wherever they need to go.“Given the issues with the capital markets, there has been growing concern around the ability to grow rooms in 2024 and beyond,” Cunningham wrote this week.“Near-term, there likely needs to be an uptick in conversions [of properties that are independent or flagged with another brand] to bridge the tough financing environment [that makes hotel construction more costly],” Cunningham wrote. “Over the next several years, we continue to assume 4% annual net room growth led by international expansion and conversions.”Patrick Scholes at Truist cares about the above factors, too, but also about a few other matters:“We receive many investor questions about the “Marriott growth algorithm,” Scholes wrote in a report on Thursday. So he’s interested in learning more about Marriott’s loyalty program and non-core projects, such as the Ritz-Carlton yachts and fees on branded residential condominiums and timeshares.“In a slowing new development pipeline and some structural questions about China’s economy/real estate market, we view [the loyalty program] Bonvoy will be once again highlighted as a critical brand within Marriott,” Scholes wrote. “We expect a focus on credit card fees and international growth of new cards as well as the MGM partnership as examples of the importance of Bonvoy.”Might Marriott preview a new brand in Europe during the presentation?Scholes is hopeful that Marriott’s execs will provide color on the possible launch of a conversion midscale brand in Europe later this year, which he assumes is not a brand acquisition but something built internally.Reading between the lines may be valuable.One thing I’ll be listening for, as a reporter, is tone. Culture eats strategy for breakfast, as they say.Can the era of CEO Anthony Capuano provide clear messaging of strategic prioritization like the Sorenson era did?I’m betting the answer is, Yes. But it’s not a sure thing.What do you hope to learn — or expect to hear — at Marriott’s investor day? Tell me.

The smooth and natural movement of these holograms will become more prevalent with the growing availability of 5G and edge computing technology.”“Through its active participation in the 5GFF, Bell continues to support the developer community to access 5G MEC technologies and to ensure their solutions take full advantage of Bell’s 5G network in Canada, and to globally interoperate,” said Bell’s Costa Pantazopoulos, VP Product. “This holographic video call demo illustrates how Bell - with partners Vodafone and Verizon - is innovating to make it easier for developers to leverage 5G capabilities to achieve their application goals.”Story continuesReal human holograms, compared to avatars, can convey the individual’s full range of emotions, and people can feel the real presence of their colleagues. Advances in connectivity, thanks to 5G and edge computing technology offered by telecom operators, make it possible to achieve smooth and natural movement of holograms, enabling up a range of possible use cases.MATSUKO is the creator of the world’s first real-time software-only solution for holographic presence using just a single camera to stream holograms in spatial computing (VR/AR). Their technology to stream holograms in real-time, creates the feeling that people are together and brings physical presence to remote communication.The demonstration will be viewable at GSMA's Open Gateway Zone. The GSMA Open Gateway initiative, which launched at MWC Barcelona now has over 30 signatories from leading mobile network operators (MNOs), representing more than 60% of mobile connections worldwide.Open Gateway is a framework of common network Application Programmable Interfaces (APIs) designed to provide universal access to operator networks for developers and works closely with Linux Foundation’s CAMARA that develops API specifications. 5GFF works closely with GSMA’s Open Gateway and CAMARA, contributing to the joint vision of a global Open API ecosystem.Throughout the day on September 27th, sessions will be held focused on developer engagement through workshops and gaining insight from industry pioneers. 5GFF will be participating in the “Why Create Future Ready Services” panel at 10:40 am PT. The Open Gateway Developer Challenge will also be announced, which will run to MWC Barcelona 2024.In addition, KT, a member of 5GFF, will also demonstrate a HPC(High Performance Computing) application delivery using the 5GFF's Edge Discovery Service APIs based on the GSMA Open Gateway Federation Architecture among the aggregators and operators at the 5GFF booth.As a 5GFF MEC Acceleration Program (MAP) member, MATSUKO is showcasing the benefit of 5GFF’s Edge Discovery API to their application. They will play the role of partner and developer, sharing the impact of 5G, MEC, network APIs on their application and experience collaborating with 5GFF to other developers.

He Plans to Fix It.Once Unthinkable Bond Yields Now the New Normal for MarketsScientists Behind Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Vaccines Win NobelStriking Hollywood writers reached a new labor agreement with studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc., but production remains shut down. An actual return to filming will require a new contract between SAG-Aftra — the Screen Actors Guild — and the Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers, the studios’ bargaining group.The actors have been on the picket line since July, striking over the same issues as writers, including wages, residual pay for reruns on streaming services and protection against artificial intelligence.“We remain on strike in our TV/Theatrical contract and continue to urge the studio and streamer CEOs and the AMPTP to return to the table and make the fair deal that our members deserve and demand,” SAG said in a statement Sunday after the writers agreement was announced.The cost of this year’s labor work stoppage, now at five months, will be in the billions of dollars — and far above the $2 billion estimate from the three-month strike that hit the industry in 2007.The combined market value of Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global, three major studios, has fallen by about $50 billion since early May, with Disney accounting for three-fourths of that loss.Two other major players, NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp. and Netflix Inc., rose during the strike.And the costs continue to mount for the companies and workers. Film and TV production remains on hold, impacting not just writers and actors but directors, crew members and industries like catering and real estate. The walkout has delayed the return of new shows for the fall TV season and films for 2024.Story continuesIf all goes according to plan, governing councils of the writers union could authorize a member vote as soon as Tuesday. They could also give scribes the OK to return to their offices, letting studios catch up on delayed work on TV shows and movies. The writers walked out on May 2.“We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional – with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership,” the guild said in a statement.Read More: The Hollywood Strike Is Ending. This Is How It Happened.The writers went on strike for the first time since 2007 to fight for higher pay from streaming services, which have reshaped how TV is made and how talent gets paid. The Screen Actors Guild joined them in July.Details of the agreement won’t be announced for a few days, however people familiar with the matter said earlier that writers gained concessions on key points, including higher wages.The studios have agreed to staff a certain number of writers on their TV shows, a figure that will increase with the number of episodes in a season, one of the people said. The two sides have also created a structure in which writers will receive bonuses for popular shows on streaming services.And it appears they have also reached an agreement on the use of artificial intelligence, which writers feared could destroy jobs.The deal will initially pave the way for soap operas, game shows and late-night talk shows to resume, even if most other productions stay shut down.The momentum from the agreement should help resolve the actors’ strike quickly, according to Alex DeGroote, a media analyst in London. Even so, it will take time before big-budget shows and movies resume production, he said.“The world’s movie theatres can celebrate,” AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said on X, formerly Twitter. “Extremely good news that progress is being made.”Shares of studios were mixed on Monday. Netflix was up 0.9% at 1:33 p.m. while Disney was down 0.6%. Warner Bros Discovery fell 3.1% and Paramount Global was little changed.The studios and writers didn’t come close to a deal before the onset of the strike, and the studios and writers then didn’t negotiate for months, during which thousands of guild members protested outside the studios’ offices from New York to Los Angeles. While the economics of streaming remained the primary focus of the guilds, the threat of artificial intelligence also emerged as a growing concern.The heads of the biggest media companies got more engaged with the dispute in late July and early August, after the actors joined the strike. The studios offered a new proposal in August that addressed many, but not all, of the writers’ concerns. The two sides negotiated for a couple of weeks before breaking off yet again.The September negotiations came as a surprise. The two sides hadn’t been speaking — at least not officially — and many studio executives were debating whether it was time to engage with the actors instead.But pressure on both sides to cut a deal had increased. Studios feared the impact of months more without the ability to produce new programming, and many writers began to push their union’s leadership to cut a deal so everyone could get back to work.Read More: Why Hollywood’s Actors and Writers Are on Strike: QuickTakePeople who work in entertainment, be they writers or grips, were starting to leave Los Angeles due to the lack of progress. Prominent writers asked to meet with the leadership of the guild to discuss the state of the negotiations, and several talk shows said they would return, only to cancel plans under pressure from the unions.When the latest talks began, four of the most powerful executives in entertainment — Netflix Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav and NBCUniversal Chief Content Officer Donna Langley — joined their labor negotiators.The studios and writers negotiated for several days. After months of public acrimony and finger-pointing, the two sides kept their public communications to a minimum as they hammered out a deal to get the industry back to work.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWith Banks Offering 5% Returns, Financial Advisers Fight IrrelevanceGot Plastic With a No. 2 Recycling Symbol?

The export ban on all types of gasoline and high-quality diesel, announced last Thursday, remains in place, the report said.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November settled at $89.68 per barrel, down 35 cents, or 0.4%, on the day. WTI earlier hit an intraday high of $91.31, after Tuesday’s 10-month high of $93.74. The U.S. crude benchmark settled last week down 0.8%, after a cumulative gain of almost 14% over three weeks.London-traded Brent for November settled at $93.29 a barrel up, up 2 cents, or 0.02%. Brent rose to as high as $94.64 earlier in the day, after Tuesday’s 10-month high of $95.96. The global oil benchmark settled last week down 0.7%, after a cumulative gain of nearly 11% over three weeks.On a broader span, crude prices have been on a tear since early June, with the rally accelerating in the past month after major oil exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would collude to remove a combined 1.3 million barrels from the market each day until the end of the year.But while the Saudi-Russian cuts and other production reductions would remove a total of about 3.0 million barrels from supply — or about 3% of daily requirement — some who follow the trade warn that inflationary pressure brought on by oil’s 30% rally over just three months could limit the market’s upside.Story continuesDollar spikes on Fed, global growth concernsThe Dollar Index on Monday extended its run up since last week, hitting its highest since November. A stronger dollar discourages buying of dollar-denominated commodities, including crude, by holders of other currencies.The dollar has seen a resurgence since the Fed last week projected another quarter-percentage point rate increase by the year-end, despite leaving rates unchanged for September at a policy meeting on Wednesday.“King Dollar will remain a headwind for oil,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “As the risks of $100 oil grow, energy traders are awaiting a fresh catalyst to ​spark the move.”Fed Chair Powell told a news conference last week that energy-driven inflation was one of the central bank’s bigger concerns.“We are prepared to raise rates further, if appropriate,"" Powell said. ""The fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean we have decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we are seeking.""The Fed had raised interest rates 11 times between February 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%.Economists fear that the Fed’s renewed hawkish stance will dampen global growth though many also agree that a lid has to be put on oil prices if the Fed is to achieve its annual inflation target of 2%.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this)Related ArticlesOil treads water as dollar hits November highs amid Fed, global concerns Oil prices settle near flat in choppy trade; Russia eases fuel export banUS grid-scale energy storage installations hit new quarterly record - report]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now.Energy stocks have been enjoying gains in the third quarter, thanks to a surge in oil prices that came on the back of production cuts and an overall sentiment that the US might be able to avoid a full-blown recession. Oil prices have hit their record highs this year, creating a dilemma for policy makers since a rise in oil prices contributes to inflation, which is already a major headache for central banks around the globe. If the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep inflation under control, it will have to begin another rate-hike spree, which could spook investors and could result in a slowdown in economic activity, crushing the oil markets. This double-edged sword is expected to hang over the economy for several months to come. But energy stocks have a solid market sentiment. Recently, a Wall Street Journal report quoted  Bill Fitzpatrick, managing director at Logan Capital, who said that there is no capacity to absorb any additional demand of oil and investors “need to be positioned for an extended period of higher oil prices because that’s the most likely scenario.”Among the reasons making oil stocks attractive this year is their valuation, too. Earlier this year oil stocks took a massive hit amid recession fears and production glut. Now that oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations, long-term investors are piling into the sector for share price gains and dividends. Oil companies are famous for their lucrative and consistent dividends and when times are tough and volatile, investors hardly pass on any opportunity for hefty dividend payments.The WSJ report also quoted Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of the multi-asset solutions team at Manulife Investment Management, who said that the oil industry and its recent dynamics are expected to create some “anxiety” for the energy sector.Story continuesLong-term analysts were already expecting a rally in oil stocks. For example, in December 2022, when there was a doom and gloom scenario for the economy everywhere, JPMorgan had said that Brent crude would finish 2023 at levels 20% higher than the levels seen during December 2022. JPMorgan, however, had noted that the decline in oil prices was not reflected in oil stocks at that time and urged investors that if they wanted to pile into oil stocks they should wait for a 20% to 30% pullback. Fast forward a few months and the perfect opportunity for investors had arrived and even today oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 American energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best American energy stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now13. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Texas-based energy company Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the best American energy stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 44 hedge funds were long Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG). The biggest stakeholder of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) was Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management which owns a $190.1 million stake in the company.12. Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American oil company Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) ranks 12th in our list of the best American energy stocks to buy now. In August Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) jumped after the company joined the S&amp;P MidCap 400.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds out of the 2023 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK).Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) said the following in its Q2 earnings call about its future plans:“The flexibility is a competitive advantage and enables us to focus on smarter decisions for value creation through cycles. In today’s market, that means voluntarily reducing activity levels and deferring TILs in production in periods of stronger pricing. While our second quarter production reached the high end of our quarterly guidance at approximately 3.7 Bcf per day, Our second half 2023 activity will be approximately one-third lower than our first half as measured by rig spuds, completions and CapEx. As we reduce our, spend on development activities, we continue to buyback shares and have increased our base dividend. In addition to our return program, we are using our strong position to strategically lease acreage. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 10,000 acres in our Marcellus and Haynesville footprint at an average cost of $2,400 per acre and expect more opportunities to add valuable acreage in the second half of the year focused on improving and adding to our inventory length.We’re doing all of this as we continue on our path to reaching an investment-grade credit rating. Today, our net debt to total cap is about 10%, and we received two recent upgrades from our credit rating agencies. We expect that our balance sheet will be further strengthened through the completion of our Eagle Ford exit, which continues to progress. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes shareholder returns and has resulted in more than $500 million being returned to shareholders so far this year, while gas prices have fallen significantly. Our approach includes a stable and growing base dividend, which has returned $150 million year-to-date in which we raised 4.5% this quarter.”Read the complete earnings call here.Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), a natural gas exploration and production company, emerged from bankruptcy with little fanfare in 2021, despite having rid itself of its debt burden and onerous pipeline contracts. The company was able to make two large acquisitions at very reasonable prices within its core producing areas, allowing for scale and cost savings. Then in 2022, natural gas prices began to rise well above expectations, increasing the value of Chesapeake’s large natural gas resources and production and contributing to its outperformance.”11. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) shares are under pressure after the company posted weak Q2 results and a reduced dividend. Recently, TD Cowen analyst David Deckelbaum said that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s shareholder returns have ""have slowly declined while its dividend payout is 3.7% of annualized yield, down from 6% in Q2.""Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) however could be a solid buy for the long term. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management which owns a $146 million stake.10. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49American downstream petroleum company Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) ranks 10th in our list of the best American energy stocks to buy now. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) recently authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion, with no expiration date.A total of 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO). The biggest stake in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) was held by Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $325 million stake in the company.9. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) swung to a loss on an adjusted basis during the second quarter amid declining commodity prices and declining sales volumes.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 51 hedge funds were long EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of the end of the second quarter. The most significant stakeholder of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which owns a $234 million stake in the company.ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“The energy sector was another positive contributor, primarily driven by our investment in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT). As North America’s leading natural gas provider, EQT had seen its share price slide as the lackluster reopening of China and a milder-than-expected winter in the northern hemisphere weighed on natural gas prices. However, as recessionary fears have given way to optimism and the prospect for greater energy demand, EQT’s share price has rebounded.

The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure.

Brands, KFC's U.S. parent company. Yum! Brands did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The delay provides another illustration of how corporate exits have become more complicated as Russia has tightened restrictions. Executives say that navigating the rules is becoming harder.Yum! Brands is one of many companies to exit Russia over Moscow's actions in Ukraine, but its departure differed from that of rival McDonald's in that some KFC franchisees were permitted to remain open and the menu was barely changed.The U.S. Treasury declined to comment. It's OFAC office issued compliance guidance to the industry regarding the exit tax in the form of FAQs, or frequently asked questions, on Feb. 24, 2023, while negotiations on KFC's exit deal were still ongoing.Yum! Brands in April finalised its exit from Russia, transferring master franchise rights to Smart Service, a local franchisee led by businessmen Konstantin Kotov and Andrey Oskolkov. The deal included all its Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and the trademark for the Rostic's brand. The price was not disclosed.""The process of finding a buyer and agreeing the basic conditions took some time,"" Levin said. ""When the basic conditions were agreed, a rule appeared that the sale of shares should be agreed with the relevant (government) department.""Story continuesOnce the buyers were approved, taking this new requirement into account, another one appeared - the budget contribution termed an ""exit tax"" by Washington - Levin said. Russia added that demand in December 2022.""The closure was delayed again, the correct procedure on paying the exit tax was agreed,"" Levin said. ""It seemed that all was agreed, everything was moving towards completion and then a foreign regulator appeared on the scene - OFAC.""""As a result, it took quite a long time to settle...we closed everything successfully in mid-April.""Former KFC restaurants began opening in April as Rostic's, reviving a brand born soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Levin added that Unirest hopes to complete the brand transition from KFC to Rostic's in 2024, with plans for 60% of the 1,200 restaurants in Russia to be Rostic's by end-2023.

To skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Expensive Cities to Visit in the US. If 2022 was the year of a deliberated return to travel, 2023 has seen a global head-first dive into tourism. As travel resumes and builds momentum to pre-pandemic levels, the resilience of the global tourism industry cannot be understated. Against all projections, international travel made a resounding comeback in 2022 with visitor numbers to Europe and the Middle East climbing to more than eighty percent of 2019 levels. The United States alone recovered more than sixty five percent of pre-pandemic tourists, even to its most expensive cities to visit. This is a remarkable feat especially since it was achieved as China doubled down on its 'Zero-COVID' policy, effectively restricting the world's largest outbound travel market. According to an article by Bloomberg, travel is set to become a $15.5 trillion industry by 2033, accounting for more than 11.6% of the global economy. To know more about the tourism industry and some of the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S and around the world, read our article on World Tourism Rankings by Country: Top 20 Countries. According to a survey by Forbes, recovery for the global travel industry in America is expected to continue on its current trajectory. International tourist arrivals are likely to reach more than 95 percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023 subject to economic headwinds, travel resurgence in the Asia-Pacific and global geopolitical turbulence. In the survey, 87% of respondents said they expect to travel more than they did in 2022 especially to the most expensive cities in the U.S. This is impressive considering the fact that nearly 45% of these respondents travelled once or twice in 2022, with 42% travelling three or more times. More than half of the respondents seemed to favor leisure trips, with the other half showing enthusiasm with respect to road trips, beach vacations, and romantic getaways. Moreover, 54% of respondents are allowing for a higher travel budgets in 2023. While it doesn't exactly mean that Americans are immune to skyrocketing inflation rates, it does mean that travel is assuming a higher priority for American consumers. It is for these reasons that investors are flocking towards prominent travel stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Furthermore, the global shift towards electronic payment methods and the fact that nearly 81% of travelers use credit and debit cards have also led to strong investor sentiment around stocks like Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP). Story continuesGlobal Travel in 2023: Six Key TrendsAs the global travel rebound continues, increasing costs, deteriorating macroeconomic climates and rising inflation rates are also leading to a significant shift in consumer attitudes. While tourist spending is showing a 112% increase compared to 2021 according to Bloomberg, the resulting shift in consumer attitudes has led Simon-Kucher to identify the emergence of six primary trends that are impacting the travel industry, in a study conducted in 2023. These trends are an incredibly strong indicator in determining consumer behavior during the holiday season. Companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) can study and use these insights to adapt to the shift in tourist behavior, not only in the United States but around the world.One of the first trends to emerge is that the cost-of-living is the primary determinant when it comes to consumer priorities. Although more than 84% of American tourists remain largely undeterred by rising prices and inflationary pressures, one in five maintain that they would consider skipping their vacation plans owing to financial constraints and would largely avoid the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S. As the cost-of-living peaks in 2023, people are more inclined on focusing on essentials and reserving their travel plans for outside the peak holiday season. To know more about some of the most expensive cities to live in the U.S, read our article on the 30 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the U.S.Secondly, another emerging trend is that inflation is a fundamental driver in determining advance booking patterns by consumers. According to the study, consumer booking lead time has hardly changed as compared to 2022, with more than 41% of tourists booking their vacation accommodations further in advance as compared to 2022. As fears of rising inflation rates mount, people are pushed increasingly towards advanced booking options, with 37% of tourists claiming they resort to advance booking to avoid inflation-driven price hikes in the most expensive cities to visit in the U.S. Since advance booking is largely carried out through electronic payment, companies like Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) have the most to gain from this trend. Thirdly, the rise of personalized travel is an emerging trend which is set to radically transform the travel industry in 2023. The number of consumers opting for personalized travel plans in lieu of all-inclusive ones is steadily rising, with more than half of the travelers in the U.S. selecting a personalized trip for their most recent vacation. Across global markets, personalized travel has increased by more than six percent.Furthermore, the rise of personalized travel coupled with increasing inflationary headwinds have given rise to segmented travel spending. Although consumer spending is anticipated to increase by eight percent regardless of rising inflation rates, growing financial constraints has given rise to three kinds of tourists: splurge, who plan to spend 20% more on tourism in 2023; stable, who plan to spend the same as they did in 2022; and cautious, who plan to spend six percent less. Splurge travelers show an increased proclivity towards personalized travel, whereas cautious and stable tourists are more inclined towards all-inclusive packages. Although tourists are planning to cut expenditure when it comes to souvenirs and local experiences, they largely intend on spending more on food, drinks and accommodation.Business travel seems to be on the downlow, with one in five respondents reporting they shall not be travelling for work. Companies have also been revisiting their travel policies, with more organizations now encouraging their employees to travel by rail rather than by air. This shift in sentiment is largely due to the rise of new virtual technologies like the metaverse. However, if you want to know about jobs that still contain a significant amount of travel, check out our article on 10 Best Jobs for People who Want to Travel.Lastly, as the world recognizes the need to meet sustainability objectives in light of the climate crisis, the tourism industry is also set to adapt. Sustainability is emerging as an immensely important priority for tourists, with one in three willing to spend more on sustainable options. The United States is leading this initiative, with 33 percent of consumers reporting that they are willing to spend more on vacation packages that meet environmental sustainability objectives. According to the study, holidaymakers have little qualms spending 55% higher on sustainable food, accommodation, and flights. In light of this trend, companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) are diverting greater investments to their sustainability imperatives to attract more favorable investor sentiment.

According to an analysis by McKinsey and Company, labor supply and demand remains unbalanced post the pandemic. Today, in the United States, more than 7% of tourism jobs are projected to remain unfilled.According to McKinsey, the industry is facing a mass exodus of tourism staff, especially from customer-centric roles, and the possibility of bringing these employees back is not expected to materialize any time soon. Hotels, restaurants, cruises, and airlines continue to face serious staff shortages which are translating into operational, reputational, and financial hiccups. If unaddressed, the labor gap may restrict the travel industry's projected growth trajectory.Some reasons that supplement this shortage may be chronic workplace challenges, the effects of the pandemic, high seasonality and low regulation of tourism jobs, long working hours, low wages, lack of social protection, and the informality of the overall working condition. The tourism industry would do well if it were to recalibrate some of its fundamentals to build a far more sustainable future. It can achieve this by either making the industry attractive to employees or by improving upon their product portfolio to complement existing staffing needs. Another solution could be to integrate within the workforce, digital and interpersonal skills needed to cater to the fast changing needs of the consumer. This new technology could be utilized to provide customers with a digitally enhanced experience, make up for labor shortages, and improve working conditions.5 Cheapest Countries to Live in EuropePhoto by Mesut Kaya on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the 30 most expensive cities to visit in the U.S, we decided to use a variety of third-party research. We first shortlisted the hundred most visited cities in the United States based on data from Allianz Partners, which reported on the top travel destinations in the U.S. between the period of 2017-2022. Then, we used three primary metrics to determine the average cost of travel per person per day in each city: average accommodation prices for one night at a mid-range hotel, food and dining costs in mid-range restaurants, and transportation expenses. We used data from Trivago and Booking.com to get the July 2023 prices of five mid-range hotels in each city. We then calculated the average to arrive at the overnight accommodation price in each city. To calculate the average food and dining expenditure, we used indices from Numbeo. And finally, to calculate average transportation costs, we used statistical data from the US. Department of Transportation. After we had compiled data on all three metrics, we averaged out our findings to obtain the average cost of travel per person per day in each city. We then ranked the cities based on the average costs, from lowest to highest.You can also read about some of the most popular tourist destinations within the U.S. in our article 30 Top Tourist Attractions in the U.S.Most Expensive Cities to Visit in the US30.

In partnership with best-selling author, motivational speaker, and award-winning podcast host Mel Robbins, Ulta Beauty is on a critical mission to combat what research found to be the number one obstacle to experiencing joy, our inner critic. Through The Joy Study, third-party research commissioned by Ulta Beauty, the retailer aims to spark a national conversation about the barriers to joy we all face and how to overcome them. Starting with a bespoke associate training curriculum, crafted by Robbins, to positively transform the way Ulta Beauty’s 53,000 associates think about themselves and ultimately empower guests to do the same.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230925298587/en/Mel Robbins and Ulta Beauty associates gear up for The Joy Project (Photo: Business Wire)""At Ulta Beauty, we strive every day to use the power of beauty to bring to life the possibilities that lie within each of us, and joy is a feeling we want everyone to experience when walking through our stores,"" said Michelle Crossan-Matos, chief marketing officer, Ulta Beauty. ""The reality is, there’s a joy deficit in our country, which if left untreated, will only continue to hold people back from living the lives they’ve always wanted. As industry leaders, who care deeply about how people experience beauty and show up in the world, we believe it’s our responsibility to help change this. By taking an inside out approach, in helping our associates unlock their own barriers to joy, and using our platforms to positively influence the communities we serve, we know we can ignite a movement that will help people everywhere live more authentic, and joyful lives.""Story continuesUlta Beauty has always championed authentic self-expression and through its purpose-driven work is redefining how the world sees beauty. The Joy Project is a continuation of these long-term efforts and builds on its commitment to make beauty a force for good for all.After listening to feedback from associates who regularly witness guests struggle with negative self-talk, Ulta Beauty was inspired to understand how the inner critic could be affecting people’s ability to experience joy and overall wellbeing. The Joy Study examined a sample of how 5,000 national adults and teens experience joy and the common barriers to experiencing it on a daily basis. The research found that 73 percent of those surveyed experience negative self-talk, 70 percent experiencing it don’t recognize negative self-talk when they’re actively doing it, and 91 percent identify negative self-talk as a primary obstacle in their ability to experience joy. Understanding this work starts from within, Ulta Beauty is partnering with Mel Robbins, to rewrite the narrative and help the beauty community at large experience more joy, starting with its vast network of associates.""It’s stunning that the research shows that negative self-talk is the biggest obstacle to experiencing joy, yet the majority of us don’t even realize how much we engage in it. I’m proud to work with Ulta Beauty and The Joy Project to address this head on. Knowing Ulta Beauty’s associates hear this self-criticism from their guests every day, Ulta Beauty and I are giving them the tools to help their guests silence the inner critic and experience more joy,"" said Robbins. ""There are so many brands and companies publicly discussing well-being, but few are activating in such a meaningful way. I’m honored to work with Ulta Beauty, creating custom trainings that will empower those associates to silence that inner critic and coach guests to do the same all with a mission to inspire a national conversation to spread more joy.""Sparking A Movement in StoresAs one of the world’s foremost experts on change and motivation, Robbins’ deep expertise in recognizing and flipping negative mindsets is the cornerstone of Ulta Beauty’s new training curriculum for store associates. Dubbed ‘A Toolkit for Joy,’ the series of mini courses taught by Robbins will provide all 53,000 associates nationwide the strategies and tangible tools needed to identify their inner critic, interrupt the negative patterns, and inspire themselves and others in the process. Once armed with this roadmap to joy, associates are encouraged to share those same practices with guests, ultimately sparking a movement with the potential to reach far beyond Ulta Beauty stores. In addition to mobilizing its fleet of associates across the country, Ulta Beauty will ignite a social movement inviting influencer and creator communities to join the conversation by posting about their own journey to joy through inspiring content encouraging others to do the same and #joyforward.""Tackling the inner critic is only the beginning, but an important step to bringing attention to an issue that has long been a source of people’s inability to experience the joy they deserve,"" adds Crossan-Matos. ""It’s our hope that by addressing this now and working together we can positively shape how future generations see themselves and ultimately create a better future for all.""Key The Joy Study FindingsMany people feel there is a gap between their current vs. desired level of joy. 85% of people wish they felt a high level of joy in their lives, but only 58% of people report feeling that way.A majority of people report negative self-talk as a key obstacle that hinders their access to joy. 91% of people (93% of teens) rate the effect of negative self-talk on their ability to experience joy to be impactful.Despite how prevalent negative self-talk is, many don’t even recognize they’re actively doing it. 67% of people say that their negative self-talk is so common and natural, they don’t even recognize when they’re actively doing it. Young people are the most unaware, with 74% of Gen Z not realizing when they’re engaging in negative self-talk.The areas individuals say negative self-talk tends to arise from include physical wellbeing and appearance (82%), body image (79%), and questioning their own worthiness of success, achievement or personal validation (76%).Gen Z is the least equipped to overcome their negative self-talk. 65% report feeling they lack the tools, relationships, or resources to recover from challenges and maintain joy, compared to 54% of the general population.Survey MethodologyThe Joy Study was conducted using the YouGov Panel that surveyed 5,007 U.S. teens and adults, ages 13 and up.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

132,050093b4-1f36-37d0-9acb-5b88a2c7c0d6,SRE,2023-09-25,3 Stocks to Buy as Rate-Cut Hopes Power Them Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-rate-cut-202536142.html,1695068736,STORY,"['SBUX', 'SRE', 'KELYB']","[Although the Federal Reserve remains committed to an aggressively hawkish monetary policy for now, that trajectory is not guaranteed to hold indefinitely. That fact bodes well for certain stocks to buy for interest rate cuts.Diving deeper, the latest report showcases a dip in hourly wages, placing the Fed in a tight spot. On one side, they’re combating inflation, but they also can’t sideline the labor market’s health. This wage drop may ripple through the economy, dampening consumer spending and challenging sectors reliant on discretionary income.Moreover, continual increases in borrowing costs can choke off innovation. That’s particularly concerning as industries like artificial intelligence (AI) stand on the brink of widespread integration. As the Fed navigates these challenges, astute investors should keep their eyes peeled for stocks to buy for interest rate cuts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this unpredictable market landscape, foresight could be golden.Starbucks (SBUX)It's Time to Wake Up and Smell the Coffee on Starbucks StockSource: ShutterstockFor many in corporate America, the daily caffeine jolt is non-negotiable. Yet Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) finds itself grappling with the trade-down effect, especially against lower-cost competitors like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). Amid inflation and mounting borrowing costs, consumers are increasingly leaning towards these cheaper alternatives.But there’s something magnetic about Starbucks. Beyond the caffeine, there’s an addiction to its iconic brand experience, which makes SBUX quite compelling.Should interest rates taper off and the job market swell, Starbucks could very well rise as one of the prime stocks to buy for interest rate cuts. Yes, SBUX carries a premium, trading at 3.2x trailing-year sales. Yet that valuation encapsulates a globally recognized brand, consistent growth, and a robust profit trajectory.Analyst sentiment offers more encouragement. They rate SBUX as a Moderate Buy, setting an average price target of $116.53. That suggests a promising 20% upside, making that cup of coffee look even more tempting to investors.Story continuesSempra (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhenever I discuss the ebb and flow of market dynamics, Sempra (NYSE:SRE) invariably comes up in the conversation. Ordinarily, I spotlight this entity when discussing the impact of rising interest rates. The logic is elementary: Utility bills are one of those inescapable aspects of life. However, Sempra intriguingly stands as a dual-edged sword, qualifying as one of the stocks to buy for interest rate cuts as well.How does that work? Well, Sempra currently offers an appealing forward dividend yield of 3.26%. While many investors turn to utility giants like SRE due to their stable, almost recession-proof nature, a dip in interest rates would paint this yield in an even more favorable light.Especially when juxtaposed against the returns from government-backed bonds, SRE could be perceived not just as a protective play. But it’s an attractive income opportunity in its own right.Another undeniable advantage? Sempra predominantly caters to Southern California, a region renowned for its affluence and economic robustness. Reflecting this potential, analysts give SRE a Moderate Buy recommendation, setting a price target at $81.95. That suggests room for over 12% upside.Kelly Services (KELYA)In this photo illustration a Kelly Services (KYELA) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOne of the stocks I’ve been eyeing recently, especially in the context of interest rate cuts is Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA). At its core, Kelly offers a value that’s intrinsically understood by every business leader — the streamlined recruitment process.With anticipated interest rate cuts potentially rejuvenating the labor market, businesses will grapple with an influx of applications. As the volume grows, it’s not only about finding a candidate but about finding the right fit quickly and efficiently. That’s where Kelly’s expertise truly shines.Beyond this streamlined service, Kelly’s offerings are impressively diverse, defying the stereotype of a typical staffing agency. It’s not just about populating cubicles; its vast network accommodates the demand for warehouse roles, manual labor jobs and a spectrum of roles in between.Financially speaking, KELYA presents a compelling case for stocks to buy for interest rate cuts. KELYA’s forward earnings multiple sits at a mere 10.3x, a noticeable discount compared to the sector median of 14.54x. Essentially, you’re looking at a stock undervalued relative to nearly three-quarters of its industry counterparts.Reflecting this underlying potential, analysts lean towards a Moderate Buy stance on Kelly Services. A projected price target hovering at $25.50 suggests an enticingly bullish horizon, with upside potential reaching about 40%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now.Energy stocks have been enjoying gains in the third quarter, thanks to a surge in oil prices that came on the back of production cuts and an overall sentiment that the US might be able to avoid a full-blown recession. Oil prices have hit their record highs this year, creating a dilemma for policy makers since a rise in oil prices contributes to inflation, which is already a major headache for central banks around the globe. If the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep inflation under control, it will have to begin another rate-hike spree, which could spook investors and could result in a slowdown in economic activity, crushing the oil markets. This double-edged sword is expected to hang over the economy for several months to come. But energy stocks have a solid market sentiment. Recently, a Wall Street Journal report quoted  Bill Fitzpatrick, managing director at Logan Capital, who said that there is no capacity to absorb any additional demand of oil and investors “need to be positioned for an extended period of higher oil prices because that’s the most likely scenario.”Among the reasons making oil stocks attractive this year is their valuation, too. Earlier this year oil stocks took a massive hit amid recession fears and production glut. Now that oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations, long-term investors are piling into the sector for share price gains and dividends. Oil companies are famous for their lucrative and consistent dividends and when times are tough and volatile, investors hardly pass on any opportunity for hefty dividend payments.The WSJ report also quoted Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of the multi-asset solutions team at Manulife Investment Management, who said that the oil industry and its recent dynamics are expected to create some “anxiety” for the energy sector.Story continuesLong-term analysts were already expecting a rally in oil stocks. For example, in December 2022, when there was a doom and gloom scenario for the economy everywhere, JPMorgan had said that Brent crude would finish 2023 at levels 20% higher than the levels seen during December 2022. JPMorgan, however, had noted that the decline in oil prices was not reflected in oil stocks at that time and urged investors that if they wanted to pile into oil stocks they should wait for a 20% to 30% pullback. Fast forward a few months and the perfect opportunity for investors had arrived and even today oil stocks are trading at attractive valuations.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 American energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best American energy stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.Best American Energy Stocks To Buy Now13. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Texas-based energy company Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the best American energy stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 44 hedge funds were long Diamondback Energy, Inc.

In today’s market, that means voluntarily reducing activity levels and deferring TILs in production in periods of stronger pricing. While our second quarter production reached the high end of our quarterly guidance at approximately 3.7 Bcf per day, Our second half 2023 activity will be approximately one-third lower than our first half as measured by rig spuds, completions and CapEx. As we reduce our, spend on development activities, we continue to buyback shares and have increased our base dividend. In addition to our return program, we are using our strong position to strategically lease acreage. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 10,000 acres in our Marcellus and Haynesville footprint at an average cost of $2,400 per acre and expect more opportunities to add valuable acreage in the second half of the year focused on improving and adding to our inventory length.We’re doing all of this as we continue on our path to reaching an investment-grade credit rating. Today, our net debt to total cap is about 10%, and we received two recent upgrades from our credit rating agencies. We expect that our balance sheet will be further strengthened through the completion of our Eagle Ford exit, which continues to progress. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes shareholder returns and has resulted in more than $500 million being returned to shareholders so far this year, while gas prices have fallen significantly. Our approach includes a stable and growing base dividend, which has returned $150 million year-to-date in which we raised 4.5% this quarter.”Read the complete earnings call here.Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), a natural gas exploration and production company, emerged from bankruptcy with little fanfare in 2021, despite having rid itself of its debt burden and onerous pipeline contracts. The company was able to make two large acquisitions at very reasonable prices within its core producing areas, allowing for scale and cost savings. Then in 2022, natural gas prices began to rise well above expectations, increasing the value of Chesapeake’s large natural gas resources and production and contributing to its outperformance.”11.

As North America’s leading natural gas provider, EQT had seen its share price slide as the lackluster reopening of China and a milder-than-expected winter in the northern hemisphere weighed on natural gas prices. However, as recessionary fears have given way to optimism and the prospect for greater energy demand, EQT’s share price has rebounded. While we continue to expect volatility in commodities prices, we believe that global energy demand, especially in Europe, along with the company’s leadership position in the natural gas market, make it a strong long-term compounder for the portfolio.”8. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shares jumped in July after the company posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings.

Pioneer is a low-cost producer in the Permian basin and can generate free cash flow when the price of oil is more than $30 per barrel.

We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets, with all international geographical areas growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia.

The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Investments for Beginners.Investors remain skeptic on the economy’s ability to completely avoid a recession. Last month equities saw a selloff driven by persistent inflation, weak jobs report and China’s economic woes. Analysts believe the Fed’s battle against inflation still has a long way to go and recession could hit the economy in the first half of 2024. Some circles however voice a lot of optimism on the back of solid state of the consumer in the US. While inflation worried some segments of the market, the bulls say the latest uptick in inflation was caused by higher energy prices. Consumer spending in the US remains strong despite the hammering households have taken due to inflation over the past several months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the “fear gauge” of the Wall Street, recently fell to its lowest point since the pandemic. VIX shows the market’s expectation of volatility based on S&amp;P 500 index options.For beginner investors with low risk appetite and limited budgets, the current market environment may seem like a chaos. Inflation storm, meme stocks, recession warnings, loads of data to process and make sense of every week and never-ending news cycle that always sound like we are an inch away from doomsday – all of this can be overwhelming and oftentimes disheartening for an average investor. But long-term investors tend to stick to their principles and ignore short-term market movements. But what if you don’t have any investing principles? After all not everyone out there is Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio. One of the best ways to get clarity in this age of volatility is to learn from the masters of the game. As Guy Spier, the legendary value investor, author of The Education of a Value Investor and manager of Aquamarine fund, says:Story continues""I read other managers’ letters. I look at the positions they own. The lists of portfolio securities that other managers own are very useful because it means the investment has already passed a very important filter. I think that whenever something in Seth Klarman’s portfolio is trading below the price that he paid for it, it is worthy of looking at, and at the same time, it performs another function. To get better at investing you want to study the moves of the masters.” Best Investments for BeginnersPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed all holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) and  Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO).

We sorted the holdings of these two funds by hedge fund sentiment, using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds.

This way, we were able to pick the top investments in the stock market which are safe, less volatile and backed by smart money investors.Best Investments for Beginners11. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best investments for beginners, thanks to the company’s strong business model, diversified revenue streams and a safe dividend. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a potential breakout stock according to Wells Fargo. Recently the firm gave a list of mega-cap stocks that it believes have the potential to gain value and called them breakout stocks. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of these companies.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 111 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). The biggest stakeholder of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”10. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112While Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) might be out of the canvas in the AI race as Nvidia gets all the attention, the company has an impressive history of catching up to its competition quickly and behind the scenes AMD is launching full-throttle efforts to launch AI chips to compete with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO earlier this year landed in Taiwan to meet her team and to light a fire under the company’s AI efforts. According to media reports, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su said the high growth phase for AI will last 5-10 more years. She said that AI products market could hit $150 billion 3-5 years from now.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a long-term investment as the company slowly but surely gains market share in the AI chips industryAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The biggest stakeholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is being seen as an AI boom beneficiary as the CRM software company announced AI-related features for its CRM platform. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) also posted strong Q2 results and gave an upbeat guidance, after which several analysts praised the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives increased his price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $255.Ives wrote in a note to investors:""With the bears expecting a softer print this quarter with macro fears swirling heading into CRM earnings, Salesforce came out of the gates swinging featuring a Djokovic-like performance with a top and bottom-line beat and raise quarter driven by MuleSoft momentum and its overall subscription business further proving strength in the Beltway.”Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff, answering a question during the company’s Q2 earnings call, said the following about generative AI:“These are mostly predictive transactions, but we’re moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products, which we’ve now released to our customers. We’re very excited about the speed of our engineering organization and technology organization, our product organization and their ability to deliver customer value with generative AI.We have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we’re kind of now in a generative zone means that’s zone number two. But as you’re going to see at Dreamforce, zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven’t really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies, and that’s an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation and growth and to help our customers in all those areas. And then we’re eventually going to move into AGI and that will be the fourth area. And I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before. Because you’re going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more productivity, more capabilities, more augmentation of your employees, as I mentioned.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is generating all the buzz around the latest iPhone 15 as analysts are swooning over the company’s new products and their revenue potential. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently said in a report that iPhone 15 pre-orders are up between 10% and 12% year-over-year – as of the night of September 17, which is ""much stronger"" than Wall Street expected.""This is a clear positive for Apple with [average selling prices] set to be a major tailwind for Cupertino in this iPhone 15 cycle with our expectation of an ASP in the ~$925 range and up roughly $100 over the last 12-15 months given heavy Pro mix model shifts,"" Ives wrote in an investor note.Dan Ives has a $240 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He reiterated his forecast for 85 million iPhone unit production for this cycle.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the best investments in the stock market for beginners. Recently, Jefferies upped its price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from $460.00 to $475.00.

These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is enjoying gains from the resilient consumer spending, as the company’s fiscal Q3 results show. Analysts believe Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) will gain even more once the economy turns the corner and consumer spending comes back to normal after inflation pressures cool.Commenting on fiscal Q3 results, Visa Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the role of retail investors in today's stock market, and go directly to read Dividend Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. While tech stocks outperformed dividend stocks in the first half of the year, there's a shift happening now as investors are increasingly showing interest in dividend-paying investments. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has dropped by more than 4% this month as of September 20, suggesting that the strong performance of tech stocks may be slowing down, potentially opening up opportunities for dividend stocks. Additionally, the recent CPI report, which shows an increase in inflation during August, has redirected investors' focus towards dividend stocks because these investments can provide them with consistent income during volatile times.Global dividend payments are also on track this year. A recent report by Janus Henderson revealed that companies worldwide are on course to pay investors a record-breaking $1.64 trillion in dividends for the year, showing over 6% increase in the second quarter. The report also indicated that 88% of global companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts in the second quarter, resulting in a total of $568.1 billion in dividends paid out since the beginning of the year. The report further mentioned that in the US, 98% of the companies that were monitored either increased their dividend payments or kept them unchanged, a rate significantly higher than the global average.Ben Lofthouse, Head of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, spoke about dividend growth and outlook this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We do expect dividend growth to continue. A weaker economic environment is typically negative for banks,"" Lofthouse said. But the positive effect on bank margins from the end of years of ultra-low interest rates is very powerful and is driving dividend payouts"".Story continuesNot only seasoned investors but also retail investors are showing interest in dividend stocks as a way to generate consistent income.

The industry growth is attributed to the rise in the number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) worldwide. That’s excellent news for retirement advisory stocks.According to Capgemini’s 2023 World Wealth Report, the total financial wealth of HNWI people worldwide was $82.9 billion. While down from 2021, it’s still up 12% from 2019. Approximately 31% of the HNWI wealth is in North America. It’s safe to assume that a big chunk of the North American component is from those living in the U.S.While wealth inequality is a severe issue, investors can lean into this reality by investing in businesses that financially service the affluent and near-affluent.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSure, most of the “Too-Big-to-Fail” banks have large wealth management divisions. So, you could buy shares in JPMorgan &amp; Chase (NYSE:JPM) to cover your bases. Or, you can look for niche businesses focused on providing financial advice.Here are three I’d put on your watchlist of stocks worth considering for your portfolio.Ameriprise Financial (AMP)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockIf you can only buy one of the retirement advisory stocks, Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) would be my choice. The large-cap was spun out of American Express (NYSE:AXP) in October 2005.In 2004, the fiscal year before the spinoff, Ameriprise had revenue of $7.25 billion, $794 million in net income and $410.2 billion in assets under management and administration (AUMA). In 2022, it had net revenue of $14.26 billion, $2.72 billion in net income and $1.18 trillion in AUMA.You’ll notice that its net margin went from 11.0% in 2004 to 19.1% in 2023. So, its net margin grew by 74%, while its AUMA increased by 189%.That’s a big reason its shares have appreciated by 856% over its 18-year history as an independent, publicly traded company. That compares to 237% for the S&amp;P 500 and 224% for American Express.Story continuesIf you owned AXP in 2005, I hope you kept the Ameriprise shares you got in the spinoff.AssetMark Financial Holdings (AMK)cash and a pen lay atop a paper with graphs and tablesSource: ShutterstockAssetMark Financial Holdings (NYSE:AMK) represents mid-cap stocks, though the California-based financial advisory’s current market cap of $1.99 billion borders on small-cap territory.The firm operates a wealth management platform for independent financial advisors in the U.S. It finished the second quarter with 9,323 financial advisors, 33% of which have more than $5 million in assets on the platform.AssetMark went public in July 2019, selling 14.4 million shares at $22. The company received 50% of the $317 million in gross proceeds from the sale. The other 50% went to its controlling shareholder, Huatai International Investment Holdings.Huatai remains its controlling shareholder with 68.8% of its shares. Huatai Securities, a subsidiary of the parent, acquired AssetMark in November 2016, paying $768 million for the financial advisory.It’s worked out for them.Huatai received approximately $146 million from the AssetMark IPO. Its remaining 50.9 million shares are worth $1.36 billion. In seven years it has doubled its money, with more gains to come.Its platform assets went over $100 billion during the second quarter for the first time. Buy AMK stock to ride it to $200 billion and beyond.Virtus Investment Partners (VRTS)Man calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.Source: wutzkohphoto / ShutterstockIf you’re looking for a good dividend stock, consider Virtus Investment Partners (NASDAQ:VRTS), a Hartford-based provider of investment management services.Virtus Investment Partners is unique in that it has brought together a group of affiliated investment managers with different investment styles.

However, despite the fall from 2021 highs above $330, Phoenix shareholders who kept their shares are up more than 1,850%.n August 17, Virtus announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.90. The annual rate of $7.60 yields a healthy 3.7%.Get paid to wait for VRTS to go on another run like the one in 2020 and 2021.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The purchase price will be funded with a mix of cash and new debt.If Herren and his CEO Chuck Robbins were terrified of the Fed, the dynamic duo wouldn't be paying more for that new debt versus one year ago.Nor would they be risking paying a 31% premium to buy Splunk into a Fed-fueled economic slowdown. Nor would they be putting their own jobs on the line by signing off on spending $28 billion.""As I talk to my peers, CFOs at other companies, I think we are all monitoring the environment. It's time to be prudent. But they are not stopping. They are not shutting down business. By the way, you can't ever time what's going to come with the FOMC. I would never try to do that,"" Herren added.morning brief imageA few weeks removed from losing out to J.M. Smucker to buy Twinkies king Hostess Brands (at a big premium, too), General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening doesn't sound like an executive going back into the cave.Quite the contrary.He would still like to pull the trigger on a deal if the price is right.""We're also disciplined as to how we do it. And we've always been disciplined. We've got a good balance sheet. We like our core business. But we will still be on the lookout for assets that we think can accelerate our growth and things that we will be particularly capable of doing well. But we'll be disciplined as we do that,"" Harmening told me on Yahoo Finance Live.Story continuesMeanwhile, new IPOs continue to arrive on the market, from a chip player in Arm to a food delivery outfit in Instacart.Both stocks have sucked wind following their IPOs, but execs at these companies pushed forward in getting their companies to market.Experts have told me the deal activity and IPO activity aren't yet done for 2023, despite the unknown quantity that is the Fed.I think that says a lot about economic resilience and how maybe, just maybe, markets won't fall off a cliff in 2024 as the last round of rate hikes filter through civilization.
