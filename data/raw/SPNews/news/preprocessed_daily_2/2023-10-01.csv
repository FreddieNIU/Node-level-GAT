The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 64% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$2.7b last week. However, the 25% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cintas. View our latest analysis for Cintas ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cintas?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Cintas does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cintas' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cintas. Our data suggests that Scott Farmer, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 14%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10.0% and 7.8% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of CintasThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Cintas Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$7.3b stake in this US$49b business. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cintas that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Under Armour with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Under Armour Under Armour's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Under Armour has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Under Armour's EPS grew from US$0.36 to US$0.87, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 138% year-on-year growth like that.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Under Armour achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 2.6% to US$5.9b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Under Armour's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Under Armour Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Under Armour followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$344m. Coming in at 12% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Should You Add Under Armour To Your Watchlist?Under Armour's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Under Armour very closely. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Under Armour.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Crude shipments from Saudi ports likely rose between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day last month from August - despite their so-called “lollypop cut” of one million barrels per day - and the trend might continue, OilPrice.com noted in a roundup of market intelligence gathered from various sources.The Saudis have also been quite restrained in adding to the Official Selling Price, or OSP, of their crude despite Brent’s runaway rally, that market roundup showed. Saudi Arabia’s medium sour crude grades were hiked by $0.10 per barrel each, moving Arab Light to a $3.60 per barrel premium vs Oman/Dubai. The only Saudi crude grade that saw a notable increase in October was Arab Super Light, a very rare condensate-like grade that sees 1-2 cargoes per month, which rose by $0.50 per barrel.“In an environment like this, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) was expected to hike Asian prices by a solid margin,” the OilPrice roundup said. “Surprisingly, the anticipated OSP increase did not happen.”“Overall, the lack of pricing ambition reflected wider worries about the health of Chinese demand into the remaining months of 2023, as well as significantly lower Indian nominations lately.”Story continuesTo Moscow’s benefit, India has begun buying Russian urals crude at around $80 per barrel - markedly higher than the $60 price cap set by the G7, but still lower than the flat price of Brent.But Russia, which has committed to the Saudi production squeeze plan by announcing a 300,000-barrel per day cut of its own, is also under pressure to keep up with deliveries promised to customers.Moscow recently eased its separate ban on fuel exports introduced to stabilize the domestic market. Analysts do not expect those restrictions to stay for long because they may hit refinery runs and impact relations with customers.Turkey, Brazil, Morocco, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia were among the main destinations for Russian diesel this year, JPMorgan said in a note.“(A) protracted export ban would negatively impact the relationship with the new customers that Russian oil companies have so painstakingly built over the last year and a half,” according to JPMorgan.Even so, Russia has not discussed a possible crude oil supply increase to compensate for Moscow’s fuel exports ban with OPEC+, the Kremlin has said.That communication might be made directly when the Russians and Saudis hold talks at the Oct. 4 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.After having psyched the trade into believing their production cuts could go on indefinitely and against market reality, it would be important for neither side not to publicly admit anything to the contrary and work instead in keeping up the narrative they have created.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Crude prices fell on the last trading day of September on growing uneasiness over how the world might cope in the coming months with exploding energy costs, even as the U.S. economy and inflation appeared to have escaped the worst of such impact right away. Those long oil also won big on the month and quarter, helped largely by chokes on Saudi and Russian supply.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November did a final trade of $90.77 per barrel on Friday after officially settling the season at $90.79, down 92 cents, or 1%, on the day.While WTI fell on the day, it rose 0.8% on the week, resuming its rally from the end of August after a one-week hiatus last week. For the month, the U.S. crude benchmark rose 8.5%, making September its best since July’s gain of nearly 16%.The July-September period, where WTI rose 26.5%, also marked the best quarter for the U.S. benchmark since the first three months of 2022. Then WTI traded as high as $130 a barrel as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine opened the way for Western sanctions on Moscow that began the long-running disruption in global commodity flows. Now, WTI is approaching triple-digit pricing again, reaching a 13-month high of $95.03 on Sept. 28.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract did a final trade at $92.09, after officially settling at $92.20 a barrel, down 90 cents, or 1%, on the day. The global crude benchmark rose 0.3% on the week, 6.8% on the month and 23% for the quarter. The global crude benchmark reached a 13-month high of $95.35 on Sept. 28.“After an amazing week, month and quarter, oil was ready for some profit-taking,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Energy traders quickly realized this wasn't the time for oil to rally above the $100 a barrel level, so they are cautiously locking in some profits.”Oil prices have gained between $25 and $30 from May lows of beneath $64 for WTI and $72 for Brent. The rally was largely in response to cumulative production squeezes of at least 1.3 million barrels per day by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two say they are trying to “balance” the market - though the reality is they are creating a supply deficit so great versus stagnant demand that prices would have no choice but to rise.The two prime movers of OPEC+ - an alliance that bands the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia - have also benefited from tacit collusion on output from U.S. oil producers.While antitrust laws forbid U.S. energy companies from participating in OPEC-like schemes that are against the spirit of free-market competition, American oil firms, lured by the Saudi bent in getting a barrel back to above $100, have restrained production too whenever possible in the name of returning cash to shareholders.Demand for U.S. crude has, meanwhile, exploded internationally as it begins to fill some pockets underserved by the Saudi-Russian squeeze. That has led to a plunge in inventory levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that serves as a central delivery and storage point for U.S. crude. This is especially so with the pick up in shipments of a new U.S. crude grade called WTI Midland - which is comparable to the viscosity of the heavier Arab and Russian oils versus the typically light-grade that’s WTI.OANDA’s Moya isn’t the only one who thinks the oil rally will have to cool with the global economy.Reuters' market analyst John Kemp says oil traders have placed so many bullish bets on crude prices that the trade has become overcrowded and was due for a correction. The ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil and fuels had risen to almost 8:1, he said. According to Kemp, this is a sign that oil prices may start reversing their gains before too long.Other analysts, however, anticipate even higher prices, with those at JP Morgan saying Brent could reach $150 per barrel.But Wall Street’s forecasters are often too caught up in chasing a market one way that they ignore counteracting forces. And one of the bigger risks to the oil rally remains the Federal Reserve and its higher-for-longer regime for U.S. interest rates.Fed Chair Powell told a news conference last week that energy-driven inflation was one of the central bank’s bigger concerns.The Fed has raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%. It could add another quarter point in November or December and more likely in 2024.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookWTI could be poised to go below $90 this week if some of the bearishness from the just-ended week stays, though jawboning by OPEC and market mania to buy every dip was likely to send the U.S. crude benchmark back towards recent highs, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Concerns about higher interest rates ahead caused WTI a pullback of about $4 from 13-month highs to close the week with indecision, but fairly bullish on month/quarter,” noted Dixit.“Going further, immediate support shifts to the 5-week EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, dynamically positioned at $89.50,’ he said. “A break below this support is likely to initiate a short-term correctional wave targeting 100 week SMA $86 which has turned into horizontal support.”On the higher side, $96.10 remains as active resistance, Dixit added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold prices fell for a second quarter in a row after losses that began in August and held through September, underscored by the current week’s drop - the worst in more than two years.Gold’s most-active futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,864.60 an ounce on Friday, after officially settling at $1,866.10, down $12.50, or 0.7% on the day. The benchmark for U.S. gold futures was down 4% for the week, its biggest weekly decline since a near 6% plunge during the week to June 11, 2021.For the third quarter, the drop in Comex gold was around 3%, after declines of 2% in August and 5% in September that offset July’s gain of 4%. In the second quarter, gold futures fell almost 4%.The spot price of gold, more closely watched by some traders than futures, settled at $1,848.73, versus the prior session’s settlement of $1,864.56. A week ago, spot gold settled at $1,924.99. At the close of June, it was at $1,919.57.More significantly, gold gave up in September its hold on the key bullish level of $1,900 an ounce that the yellow metal had held since mid-August. That came after some investors found the dollar - the archrival to gold - a better safe haven as U.S. economic growth remained relatively superior to the rest of the world.Gross domestic product in the United States grew 2.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, after 2.2% in the first. GDP is projected to expand 2.1% for all of 2023. The euro area economy, in contrast, is projected to grow just 0.7% this year.Bond yields, dollar seen pressuring gold further despite retreat But more than all these, gold was negatively impacted by a selloff in U.S. bonds that sent the dollar flying as investors chased yields.Bond yields, benchmarked to the return on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, hovered at just under 4.58 on Friday after reaching a 16-year high of nearly 4.69 on Thursday.Gold is getting crushed here despite some calm in the bond market as investors pile back into equities. Real yields are not backing away anytime soon and that still has gold on the ropes.The Dollar Index remained stubbornly at around 106 - adding to the weight on gold - after a 10-month high of 106.84 on Wednesday.The dollar held up despite the latest inflation data that raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might extend its hold on interest rates at its November policy meeting. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, a price gauge closely followed by the Fed, rose 0.4% last month, just below Wall Street expectations for a 0.5% rise.Gold: Price OutlookDixit of SKCharting noted that last week’s loss in gold was one of the biggest in months, with futures losing $80 from $1,927 to settle at $1,846, as the dollar hit a 10-month high of 106.84.“The reaction to the bullish dollar has been strong enough to push gold through major support levels that include the 50-week EMA of $1,899 and the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $1855, which aligns with the monthly Middle Bollinger Band,” said Dixit.He said the daily time frame price action indicates gold has approached oversold conditions and the next major support was seen at the 200-week SMA of $1,812.“A bounce back towards the support-turned-resistance zone is likely to start towards $1,855, above which sits the $1,885 and $1,900 resistance levels,” Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures finished the last trading day of September down while posting weekly, monthly and even quarterly gains as the price of America’s favorite fuel for indoor heating and cooling neared the key psychological bullish $3 mark.The most active November gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.930 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, after officially settling the session at $2.929 — down 1.6 cents, or 0.5% on the day.For the week though, November gas rose 11%. For the month, it was up 5.8% while for the third quarter, it gained 4.7%.“Window dressing by commodity funds and other entities with mandated monthly or quarterly reports and/or rebalance schedules may have played a role in the earlier selloff, as today is the final traded session with any meaningful liquidity prior to the beginning of Q4,” analysts at Gelber &amp; Associates, a Houston-based energy trading advisory, said in a note to their clients.“Also significant is [the] price’s proximity to the $3.00 level of resistance,” Gelber’s analysts said. “Prices reaching such significant levels can drive those with much longer-term price sensitivities to hedge, such as producers.”This month’s breakout to near $3 pricing marks the third attempt by gas bulls to get the market to that pivotal point since its fall from a high of $4.40 in January. For most of the year, the most-active gas contract on the Henry Hub has been stuck at mid-$2 levels, hampered by benign weather that neither needed too much cooling or heating.Record daily production, often crossing 100 billion cubic feet, or bcf, per day has been another problem.A huge stockpile overhang had also depressed the market. As of the end of last week, U.S. gas in storage stood at 3.359 trillion cubic feet, up 13.4 from a year ago and 6% higher than the five-year average.With fall season now having begun in the United States, forecasts of cooler weather in the coming weeks could lead to higher heating demand and change in the dynamics of gas storage and pricing, analysts say.Natural gas: Price OutlookSince mid-June, gas futures on Henry Hub have maintained stability above the Middle Bollinger Band, settling the current week on a strong bullish note, noted Dixit.“Next on the higher side, we have $3.18 and $3.24 as key resistance, followed by the 50-week EMA $3.35 as a short-term challenge,” said Dixit. “Effective support is seen at the Weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $2.59. which has kept the positivity intact.”But he also noted that the November contract had a runaway gap at $2.78 that was due for filling at some point and this could push it back towards support levels.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesStaff at top US farm research center file new workplace safety complaintNatural dips on last day of Sept with big gains on week, month and qtr]"

15,443d699b-8a43-31f6-9bf5-024e3508f73b,FE,2023-10-01,FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.41,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-nyse-fe-announced-increasing-120552362.html,1696075552,STORY,['FE'],"[The board of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) has announced that the dividend on 1st of December will be increased to $0.41, which will be 5.1% higher than last year's payment of $0.39 which covered the same period. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 4.6%. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before this announcement, FirstEnergy was paying out 195% of what it was earning, and not generating any free cash flows either. This high of a dividend payment could start to put pressure on the balance sheet in the future.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 52%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.20 total annually to $1.56. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 3.4% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.FirstEnergy's Dividend Might Lack GrowthWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that FirstEnergy has been growing its earnings per share at 13% a year over the past five years. While EPS is growing at a decent rate, but future growth could be limited by the amount of earnings being paid out to shareholders.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think FirstEnergy will make a great income stock. Strong earnings growth means FirstEnergy has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for FirstEnergy (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Is FirstEnergy not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsSchlumberger has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Schlumberger's EPS soared from US$1.86 to US$2.76, over the last year. That's a commendable gain of 48%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Schlumberger is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.8 percentage points to 16%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Schlumberger's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Schlumberger has a market capitalisation of US$87b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$190m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Schlumberger Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Schlumberger's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Schlumberger's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Schlumberger  that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Hologic's (NASDAQ:HOLX) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Hologic is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$931m ÷ (US$9.3b - US$981m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Hologic has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.9% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. See our latest analysis for Hologic roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Hologic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hologic here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Hologic Tell Us?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 11% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 43% in that time. 11% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Hologic has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Key TakeawayThe main thing to remember is that Hologic has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 71% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Hologic  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

""The consumer is proving to be resilient.""Nike sales fell about 2% in the US, and its overall sales missed Wall Street estimates for the first time in about two years. But after reporting first quarter fiscal earnings, Nike executives made little mention of any demand concerns and said it expects sales to grow during the crucial holiday season.Barclays consumer discretionary senior analyst Adrienne Yih described the report as a ""relief,"" as it defied a growing narrative that Nike could be caught up in the mounting macro headwinds many believe will slow consumer spending in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares of the shoe giant reversed some of their 2023 losses on the news, rising over 6% on Friday. Nike stock is down nearly 20% for the year.""When we see a consumer pullback, oftentimes we see a crunch in dollars, and so people start to kick out their second, third, or maybe their fourth favorite brand,"" Yih said. ""But their favorite brand they continue to spend at. I think that's what you're seeing with the power of Nike being the No. 1 brand both domestically and globally.""Student loan payments are set to restart in October, and some larger retailers that sell multiple brands have noted that will likely hurt sales at their business.""There are some headwinds coming, particularly with [student loans], that expiration of the loan forgiveness,"" Macy's (M) CEO Jeff Gennette said on Aug. 22, sending the stock tumbling on concerns over consumer health through the rest of the year.Nike, which notably sells a more pointed selection of largely athletic wear, didn't mention student loans once. In China, where economic growth has been slower than many expected including for Nike, CEO John Donahoe noted the retailer feels it can withstand fears of waning demand and new competition.Story continues""Sport is back in China, you can just feel it,"" Donahoe said. ""That gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.""Foot Locker (FL) has been warning about a ""tough macro backdrop"" since May and most recently said a weaker than expected back-to-school shopping season contributed to it slashing full-year sales guidance for the second time in as many quarters. Nike isn't seeing that problem yet, either.""Within back to school, we outperformed the industry,"" Nike's CFO Friend said. ""And when you look at our performance over the quarter, we saw momentum building throughout the quarter heading into back to school. And so, we were encouraged by what we were seeing from a consumer perspective.""A Nike basketball is seen on the floor during the Phil Knight Invitational at Moda Center on Nov. 24, 2022 in Portland, Ore.

33,424226ac-fc6b-322b-a971-daa7facbbc10,NOV,2023-10-01,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-045823327.html,1696136303,STORY,"['CL=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com -- It's OPEC+ week ahead and we can expect the drone on how much higher crude prices can go to continue all week.After a near 30% gain in the third quarter, it’s not surprising that the greed side of the market wants more.The enablers of that on the production side of OPEC+ - Saudi Arabia and Russia - are, however, facing some challenges in growing the rally.Already, India’s imports of Saudi oil in September are set to come in at below 500,000 barrels per day - the lowest monthly level in almost a decade - as global crude benchmark Brent peaked at nearly $98 from a March low of just above $70.Also, the Saudis might have to ease production cuts in October - instead of adding to them - due to contractual obligations. Crude shipments from Saudi ports likely rose between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day last month from August - despite their so-called “lollypop cut” of one million barrels per day - and the trend might continue, OilPrice.com noted in a roundup of market intelligence gathered from various sources.The Saudis have also been quite restrained in adding to the Official Selling Price, or OSP, of their crude despite Brent’s runaway rally, that market roundup showed. Saudi Arabia’s medium sour crude grades were hiked by $0.10 per barrel each, moving Arab Light to a $3.60 per barrel premium vs Oman/Dubai. The only Saudi crude grade that saw a notable increase in October was Arab Super Light, a very rare condensate-like grade that sees 1-2 cargoes per month, which rose by $0.50 per barrel.“In an environment like this, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) was expected to hike Asian prices by a solid margin,” the OilPrice roundup said. “Surprisingly, the anticipated OSP increase did not happen.”“Overall, the lack of pricing ambition reflected wider worries about the health of Chinese demand into the remaining months of 2023, as well as significantly lower Indian nominations lately.”Story continuesTo Moscow’s benefit, India has begun buying Russian urals crude at around $80 per barrel - markedly higher than the $60 price cap set by the G7, but still lower than the flat price of Brent.But Russia, which has committed to the Saudi production squeeze plan by announcing a 300,000-barrel per day cut of its own, is also under pressure to keep up with deliveries promised to customers.Moscow recently eased its separate ban on fuel exports introduced to stabilize the domestic market. Analysts do not expect those restrictions to stay for long because they may hit refinery runs and impact relations with customers.Turkey, Brazil, Morocco, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia were among the main destinations for Russian diesel this year, JPMorgan said in a note.“(A) protracted export ban would negatively impact the relationship with the new customers that Russian oil companies have so painstakingly built over the last year and a half,” according to JPMorgan.Even so, Russia has not discussed a possible crude oil supply increase to compensate for Moscow’s fuel exports ban with OPEC+, the Kremlin has said.That communication might be made directly when the Russians and Saudis hold talks at the Oct. 4 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.After having psyched the trade into believing their production cuts could go on indefinitely and against market reality, it would be important for neither side not to publicly admit anything to the contrary and work instead in keeping up the narrative they have created.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Crude prices fell on the last trading day of September on growing uneasiness over how the world might cope in the coming months with exploding energy costs, even as the U.S. economy and inflation appeared to have escaped the worst of such impact right away. Those long oil also won big on the month and quarter, helped largely by chokes on Saudi and Russian supply.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November did a final trade of $90.77 per barrel on Friday after officially settling the season at $90.79, down 92 cents, or 1%, on the day.While WTI fell on the day, it rose 0.8% on the week, resuming its rally from the end of August after a one-week hiatus last week. For the month, the U.S. crude benchmark rose 8.5%, making September its best since July’s gain of nearly 16%.The July-September period, where WTI rose 26.5%, also marked the best quarter for the U.S. benchmark since the first three months of 2022. Then WTI traded as high as $130 a barrel as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine opened the way for Western sanctions on Moscow that began the long-running disruption in global commodity flows. Now, WTI is approaching triple-digit pricing again, reaching a 13-month high of $95.03 on Sept. 28.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract did a final trade at $92.09, after officially settling at $92.20 a barrel, down 90 cents, or 1%, on the day. The global crude benchmark rose 0.3% on the week, 6.8% on the month and 23% for the quarter. The global crude benchmark reached a 13-month high of $95.35 on Sept. 28.“After an amazing week, month and quarter, oil was ready for some profit-taking,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Energy traders quickly realized this wasn't the time for oil to rally above the $100 a barrel level, so they are cautiously locking in some profits.”Oil prices have gained between $25 and $30 from May lows of beneath $64 for WTI and $72 for Brent. The rally was largely in response to cumulative production squeezes of at least 1.3 million barrels per day by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two say they are trying to “balance” the market - though the reality is they are creating a supply deficit so great versus stagnant demand that prices would have no choice but to rise.The two prime movers of OPEC+ - an alliance that bands the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia - have also benefited from tacit collusion on output from U.S. oil producers.While antitrust laws forbid U.S. energy companies from participating in OPEC-like schemes that are against the spirit of free-market competition, American oil firms, lured by the Saudi bent in getting a barrel back to above $100, have restrained production too whenever possible in the name of returning cash to shareholders.Demand for U.S. crude has, meanwhile, exploded internationally as it begins to fill some pockets underserved by the Saudi-Russian squeeze. That has led to a plunge in inventory levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that serves as a central delivery and storage point for U.S. crude. This is especially so with the pick up in shipments of a new U.S. crude grade called WTI Midland - which is comparable to the viscosity of the heavier Arab and Russian oils versus the typically light-grade that’s WTI.OANDA’s Moya isn’t the only one who thinks the oil rally will have to cool with the global economy.Reuters' market analyst John Kemp says oil traders have placed so many bullish bets on crude prices that the trade has become overcrowded and was due for a correction. The ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil and fuels had risen to almost 8:1, he said. According to Kemp, this is a sign that oil prices may start reversing their gains before too long.Other analysts, however, anticipate even higher prices, with those at JP Morgan saying Brent could reach $150 per barrel.But Wall Street’s forecasters are often too caught up in chasing a market one way that they ignore counteracting forces. And one of the bigger risks to the oil rally remains the Federal Reserve and its higher-for-longer regime for U.S. interest rates.Fed Chair Powell told a news conference last week that energy-driven inflation was one of the central bank’s bigger concerns.The Fed has raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%. It could add another quarter point in November or December and more likely in 2024.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookWTI could be poised to go below $90 this week if some of the bearishness from the just-ended week stays, though jawboning by OPEC and market mania to buy every dip was likely to send the U.S. crude benchmark back towards recent highs, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Concerns about higher interest rates ahead caused WTI a pullback of about $4 from 13-month highs to close the week with indecision, but fairly bullish on month/quarter,” noted Dixit.“Going further, immediate support shifts to the 5-week EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, dynamically positioned at $89.50,’ he said. “A break below this support is likely to initiate a short-term correctional wave targeting 100 week SMA $86 which has turned into horizontal support.”On the higher side, $96.10 remains as active resistance, Dixit added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold prices fell for a second quarter in a row after losses that began in August and held through September, underscored by the current week’s drop - the worst in more than two years.Gold’s most-active futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,864.60 an ounce on Friday, after officially settling at $1,866.10, down $12.50, or 0.7% on the day. The benchmark for U.S. gold futures was down 4% for the week, its biggest weekly decline since a near 6% plunge during the week to June 11, 2021.For the third quarter, the drop in Comex gold was around 3%, after declines of 2% in August and 5% in September that offset July’s gain of 4%. In the second quarter, gold futures fell almost 4%.The spot price of gold, more closely watched by some traders than futures, settled at $1,848.73, versus the prior session’s settlement of $1,864.56. A week ago, spot gold settled at $1,924.99. At the close of June, it was at $1,919.57.More significantly, gold gave up in September its hold on the key bullish level of $1,900 an ounce that the yellow metal had held since mid-August. That came after some investors found the dollar - the archrival to gold - a better safe haven as U.S. economic growth remained relatively superior to the rest of the world.Gross domestic product in the United States grew 2.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, after 2.2% in the first. GDP is projected to expand 2.1% for all of 2023. The euro area economy, in contrast, is projected to grow just 0.7% this year.Bond yields, dollar seen pressuring gold further despite retreat But more than all these, gold was negatively impacted by a selloff in U.S. bonds that sent the dollar flying as investors chased yields.Bond yields, benchmarked to the return on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, hovered at just under 4.58 on Friday after reaching a 16-year high of nearly 4.69 on Thursday.Gold is getting crushed here despite some calm in the bond market as investors pile back into equities. Real yields are not backing away anytime soon and that still has gold on the ropes.The Dollar Index remained stubbornly at around 106 - adding to the weight on gold - after a 10-month high of 106.84 on Wednesday.The dollar held up despite the latest inflation data that raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might extend its hold on interest rates at its November policy meeting. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, a price gauge closely followed by the Fed, rose 0.4% last month, just below Wall Street expectations for a 0.5% rise.Gold: Price OutlookDixit of SKCharting noted that last week’s loss in gold was one of the biggest in months, with futures losing $80 from $1,927 to settle at $1,846, as the dollar hit a 10-month high of 106.84.“The reaction to the bullish dollar has been strong enough to push gold through major support levels that include the 50-week EMA of $1,899 and the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $1855, which aligns with the monthly Middle Bollinger Band,” said Dixit.He said the daily time frame price action indicates gold has approached oversold conditions and the next major support was seen at the 200-week SMA of $1,812.“A bounce back towards the support-turned-resistance zone is likely to start towards $1,855, above which sits the $1,885 and $1,900 resistance levels,” Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures finished the last trading day of September down while posting weekly, monthly and even quarterly gains as the price of America’s favorite fuel for indoor heating and cooling neared the key psychological bullish $3 mark.The most active November gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.930 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, after officially settling the session at $2.929 — down 1.6 cents, or 0.5% on the day.For the week though, November gas rose 11%. For the month, it was up 5.8% while for the third quarter, it gained 4.7%.“Window dressing by commodity funds and other entities with mandated monthly or quarterly reports and/or rebalance schedules may have played a role in the earlier selloff, as today is the final traded session with any meaningful liquidity prior to the beginning of Q4,” analysts at Gelber &amp; Associates, a Houston-based energy trading advisory, said in a note to their clients.“Also significant is [the] price’s proximity to the $3.00 level of resistance,” Gelber’s analysts said. “Prices reaching such significant levels can drive those with much longer-term price sensitivities to hedge, such as producers.”This month’s breakout to near $3 pricing marks the third attempt by gas bulls to get the market to that pivotal point since its fall from a high of $4.40 in January. For most of the year, the most-active gas contract on the Henry Hub has been stuck at mid-$2 levels, hampered by benign weather that neither needed too much cooling or heating.Record daily production, often crossing 100 billion cubic feet, or bcf, per day has been another problem.A huge stockpile overhang had also depressed the market. As of the end of last week, U.S. gas in storage stood at 3.359 trillion cubic feet, up 13.4 from a year ago and 6% higher than the five-year average.With fall season now having begun in the United States, forecasts of cooler weather in the coming weeks could lead to higher heating demand and change in the dynamics of gas storage and pricing, analysts say.Natural gas: Price OutlookSince mid-June, gas futures on Henry Hub have maintained stability above the Middle Bollinger Band, settling the current week on a strong bullish note, noted Dixit.“Next on the higher side, we have $3.18 and $3.24 as key resistance, followed by the 50-week EMA $3.35 as a short-term challenge,” said Dixit. “Effective support is seen at the Weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $2.59. which has kept the positivity intact.”But he also noted that the November contract had a runaway gap at $2.78 that was due for filling at some point and this could push it back towards support levels.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesStaff at top US farm research center file new workplace safety complaintNatural dips on last day of Sept with big gains on week, month and qtr]"

35,9146dc53-8e80-3219-b0d9-b2cf0270767a,NOV,2023-10-01,Hydrogen's Rise Fuels Global Ammonia Infrastructure Growth,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hydrogens-rise-fuels-global-ammonia-170000115.html,1696093200,STORY,['NG=F'],"[As hydrogen gains prominence amid the global pursuit of decarbonization and energy security, many major infrastructure projects are considering transportation in the form of ammonia, a safer and more cost-effective method for exporting hydrogen supplies in large volumes. Rystad Energy’s projections indicate that 174 export terminals will primarily focus on converting hydrogen into ammonia by 2035, accounting for 62% of total exported volumes, or about 13.5 million tonnes per annum (tpa).In support of the broader energy transition, a substantial upsurge in clean ammonia transportation and trade is anticipated, with traded volumes of ammonia projected to reach 76 million tonnes by 2035, four times the volume transported and traded in 2020. This surge, primarily originating from Africa and North America, will lead to a five-fold increase in ammonia exports by 2050 to 121 million tonnes.Nations such as Japan and Germany have already adapted their respective national hydrogen strategies in anticipation of a greater role for the fuel, highlighting the pivotal role that hydrogen will play in helping reach net-zero emission targets. Despite the substantial scale of export projects and uncertainties surrounding future trade dynamics, some project developers may decide to partially convert hydrogen to ammonia or explore alternative transportation methods. In the meantime, investors are increasingly raising their confidence in the ammonia market and making significant near-term investments.Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, is the cleanest but most expensive form. Blue hydrogen, produced using natural gas, is more cost-efficient and widely seen as a transition fuel that can help reduce emissions until affordable and reliable alternatives are scaled up. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is already widely used as transportation and power-generation fuel, and its facilities could be adapted to transport hydrogen as well.Hydrogen penetration is moving quickly and globally, entering new geographies and outpacing market expectations. With the ammonia trade booming, there is an urgent need to leverage existing assets to their fullest potential. Converting LNG terminals could be a good solution, not only optimizing current infrastructure but also spurring a re-evaluation of strategies that can cope with the scale of the expected market expansionStory continuesMinh Khoi Le, Head of Hydrogen Research, Rystad EnergyLearn more with Rystad Energy’s Hydrogen Solution.Future flows: North America, Africa and Australia feature prominentlyOur estimates show global clean ammonia exports are set to surge to 121 million tpa by 2050, with Africa contributing 40.7 million tpa and Australia with 35.9 million tpa based on announced projects.There are currently 220 ammonia infrastructure projects globally, with a combined handling capacity of more than 6 million tonnes. Australia, which is aspiring to be a top clean ammonia exporter, presently has just seven terminals with total storage capacity of approximately 173,000 tonnes. Without substantial expansion by 2040, this would be capable of accommodating just two to three days of planned clean ammonia exports.To handle Australia’s projected monthly exports of ammonia, terminal capacity will need to increase ten-fold. This is especially important considering Australian projects, such as the Western Green Hydrogen Hub and the Australia Renewable Energy Hub, will be among the largest hydrogen projects worldwide and are considering ammonia as a transportation medium.Public-private partnerships: government holds the key to action, matching industry enthusiasmAlthough the hydrogen economy is still in its early stages of development, demand for ammonia is already on-track to outpace available infrastructure. Both private and public sectors support the development of a global hydrogen economy, with major companies signing agreements with ammonia producers and governments auctioning off import contracts.For example, JERA, a prominent player in Japan’s power generation sector, recently initiated a tender to secure an annual supply of up to 500,000 tonnes of ammonia, starting from 2027. This move is aimed at supporting coal generation co-firing applications within Japan and has involved active negotiations with ammonia producers such as CF Industries and Yara. Meanwhile, in Germany, major energy companies E. ON, Uniper and RWE have entered ammonia-related memorandums of understanding with international firms, including EverWind (Canada), Greenko (India) and Hyphen (Namibia).On the governmental front, auctions aimed at sourcing ammonia imports are gaining popularity. Germany’s H2Global auction, backed by €900 million ($978 million) in governmental support, will be the first of its kind globally and offer 10-year purchase agreements for green ammonia. Additionally, various government-backed initiatives are geared towards creating fresh demand for ammonia, including its use as an alternative fuel in the maritime sector (supported by the FuelEU Maritime initiative) and co-firing applications in Japan.Industry experts are already exploring the technical feasibility of these transitions, especially considering the projected rise in ammonia utilization for power generation and shipping. We estimate that switching LNG export and import facilities to ammonia would incur estimated costs ranging from 11% to 20% of the total LNG terminal capital expenditure, depending on factors such as demand and location.Shipping industry growth and transition opportunities for LPG carriersWhile still in its early stages, the ammonia shipping industry is expanding swiftly. Currently, just 30% of the global liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fleet can transport ammonia, with only 50 large and very large gas carriers having this capability. To meet rising demand, Eastern Pacific Shipping has commissioned four very large ammonia carriers (VLACs) from Jiangnan Shipbuilding Group. These VLACs will become the world’s largest carriers, each boasting 93,000 cubic meters of capacity.To transport the announced 121 million tonnes of ammonia, approximately 200 VLACs will be required, necessitating an investment of approximately $20 billion in newbuilds. Beyond newbuilds, interest is growing in retrofitting LPG vessels for ammonia carriage. Given the availability of over 1,450 LPG carriers, converting these vessels into ammonia-ready carriers offers a robust transition strategy for shipowners, particularly as demand for LPG tonne-mileage is anticipated to decline amid decarbonization efforts.By Rystad Energy More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran, Venezuela, And Syria Ink Landmark Oil Refinery DealDecentralized Energy Production Shakes Up Traditional GridsFuel Cells Are Key To America’s Energy IndependenceRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Zoetis managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Zoetis maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 2.8% to US$8.2b.

The Federal Reserve has gone on a dramatic rate hiking campaign as it seeks to stamp out inflation.Many analysts had expected the Fed to finally pivot as inflation appears to be slowing. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week left the door open for another rate hike.In any case, it appears unlikely that rates are coming back down in the near future. That, in turn, is likely to lead to a slump in the residential real estate market. Here’s how to stay safe and make a profit from the residential real estate market moving forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockReal estate investment trusts (REITs) have been getting crushed this year. That’s due to rising interest rates, which have two negative effects on apartment REITs. For one, REITs usually use a lot of debt and will pay more in interest when they refinance their loans. And, for another, as yields go up, investors demand higher yields (and thus lower stock prices) on their REIT holdings.All this has pushed down apartment REITs, such as Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), in 2023. MAA stock is down about 15% year-to-date.However, its underlying holdings of 101.986 apartment units should hold their value well during the current economic storm.In fact, as people are increasingly priced out of being able to buy their own homes, we should expect to see more folks renting for longer. This should lead to steady demand for Mid-America’s units. That’s doubly true thanks to favorable demographics and underbuilding in the housing industry over the past 15 years. The housing market may be heading down, but counterintuitively, that could be good news for MAA stock.With shares at 52-week lows, the stock now offers considerable value and a 4.1% dividend yield. This is a way investors can play the residential real estate market.Story continuesSPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB)A photo of a man in a mask and neon green vest in front of a home that's under construction.Source: Tong_stocker/ShutterStock.comHomebuilders should be one of the biggest losers from high-interest rates and the downturn in the housing market. And yet, so far, the SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB) is up sharply over the past year. Here’s why that won’t last, and, in fact, it’s time to sell XHB and other homebuilding stocks.First, let’s understand why homebuilders have rallied. Ironically, people have gotten stuck in their existing homes due to rising interest rates. If a person has a 4% fixed rate mortgage on their existing house, they are unlikely to sell it and buy a new house with a 7.5% mortgage today. As a result of this dynamic, the supply of used houses has declined.New homebuilders were able to fill that void with shiny new inventory. That explains why homebuilders have outperformed expectations so far. However, let’s not lose sight of the bigger picture. Average mortgage rates are above 7% and heading higher. This has slashed the average household’s prospective buying power.As interest rates stabilize at far higher levels, the cold reality of the situation will sink in. If a household could afford a $500,000 mortgage at previously low-interest rates, perhaps they will only buy a $300,000 house now given the far higher monthly payments in the new interest rate landscape.Homebuilding stocks were absolutely wrecked in the 2008 financial crisis. This is not a sector known for faring well during recessions. Investors should take advantage of the current rally in the XHB ETF and homebuilder stocks and get out before it’s too late.First American Financial (FAF)a person holds up a scrap of paper that asks ""Are you covered?""Source: ShutterstockTitle insurance is a unique form of insurance based on the deed for a house or commercial building. The title insurer investigates all potential claims against a property and guarantees that a house is being sold in good standing without any legal liabilities such as back taxes or conflicting wills that could invalidate a transaction.What makes this niche so attractive is that most banks will only underwrite mortgages on properties with title insurance. In effect, it is a requirement to buy a house with a mortgage. That makes for a pretty strong competitive moat, especially as there are only five nationwide title insurers with meaningful market share. When people have to buy a good and the number of suppliers is limited, good profit margins tend to follow.Title insurance takes much less market risk than, say, homebuilders. Unlike a homebuilder, the insurer doesn’t have to own land, deal with expensive construction materials, or end up with large amounts of potentially unsold inventory.The title insurer is simply writing policies on homes entering a mortgage contract and taking a cut of that. A down housing market will temporarily limit profits, sure. But there’s minimal longer-term risk to the business’ fortunes; when transaction volumes pop back up, so do the title insurers’ profits. Another favorable point is that in a recession, rising foreclosures and forced sales generate additional demand for title insurance services.A leading firm in the field is First American Financial (NYSE:FAF).

""The consumer is proving to be resilient.""Nike sales fell about 2% in the US, and its overall sales missed Wall Street estimates for the first time in about two years. But after reporting first quarter fiscal earnings, Nike executives made little mention of any demand concerns and said it expects sales to grow during the crucial holiday season.Barclays consumer discretionary senior analyst Adrienne Yih described the report as a ""relief,"" as it defied a growing narrative that Nike could be caught up in the mounting macro headwinds many believe will slow consumer spending in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares of the shoe giant reversed some of their 2023 losses on the news, rising over 6% on Friday. Nike stock is down nearly 20% for the year.""When we see a consumer pullback, oftentimes we see a crunch in dollars, and so people start to kick out their second, third, or maybe their fourth favorite brand,"" Yih said. ""But their favorite brand they continue to spend at. I think that's what you're seeing with the power of Nike being the No. 1 brand both domestically and globally.""Student loan payments are set to restart in October, and some larger retailers that sell multiple brands have noted that will likely hurt sales at their business.""There are some headwinds coming, particularly with [student loans], that expiration of the loan forgiveness,"" Macy's (M) CEO Jeff Gennette said on Aug. 22, sending the stock tumbling on concerns over consumer health through the rest of the year.Nike, which notably sells a more pointed selection of largely athletic wear, didn't mention student loans once. In China, where economic growth has been slower than many expected including for Nike, CEO John Donahoe noted the retailer feels it can withstand fears of waning demand and new competition.Story continues""Sport is back in China, you can just feel it,"" Donahoe said. ""That gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.""Foot Locker (FL) has been warning about a ""tough macro backdrop"" since May and most recently said a weaker than expected back-to-school shopping season contributed to it slashing full-year sales guidance for the second time in as many quarters. Nike isn't seeing that problem yet, either.""Within back to school, we outperformed the industry,"" Nike's CFO Friend said. ""And when you look at our performance over the quarter, we saw momentum building throughout the quarter heading into back to school. And so, we were encouraged by what we were seeing from a consumer perspective.""A Nike basketball is seen on the floor during the Phil Knight Invitational at Moda Center on Nov. 24, 2022 in Portland, Ore.

Despite the recent volatility, quality companies are still trading at reasonable prices, and many such companies have solid fundamentals.The key is focusing on businesses that are undervalued and have significant growth potential. Investor spirits tend to rise heading into the Fall, renewing interest in stocks that offer both value and growth potential.Thus, now is the moment to identify stocks poised to outperform through 2023. I’ll highlight seven stocks across different sectors that need to be on your radar this Fall. From proven blue chips to emerging disruptors with significant upside, these picks check the boxes of stability, growth drivers, and discounted valuations to deliver solid returns over the next 6-12 months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhether building a core portfolio or hunting for opportunistic plays, I believe these stocks deserve a spot on your shortlist. The logic behind each is straightforward; their upside outweighs varying levels of risk. With that in mind, consider the following seven stocks.Opera Limited (OPRA)Black and cyber blue illustration of brain made out of light of circuit board with chip at the center of the brain, representing artificial intelligence (AI) stocksSource: shutterstock.com/cono0430Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) is an emerging browser company uniquely positioned to capitalize on two of tech’s hottest trends – the shift to mobile, and AI integration. The company owns a suite of AI-enhanced mobile browsers boasting over 316 million monthly active users globally.Opera’s growth strategy centers on expanding its user base in Western markets, where monetization rates are significantly higher. The company has delivered phenomenal results in these markets, with revenue growth of more than 20% annually. At the same time, Opera’s stock has fallen from highs of $28 in July to around $13 currently, opening up an attractive buying opportunity for value investors.With strong momentum in adding higher-value Western users, Opera looks poised to continue its rapid growth. The company is also integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its mobile browsers before its competitors, giving the company a first-mover advantage in this potentially lucrative space. Opera recently launched the AI-powered Opera One desktop browser to rave reviews.Story continuesOpera offers excellent upside potential at current levels, with a price-to-earnings ratio at just 17-times. Analysts expect the company to continue growing its top line around 15% annually for the foreseeable future, hinting at 63% upside potential for OPRA stock over the next year.Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been battered by a series of headwinds, with its stock plunging over 70% from all-time highs. However, the negativity with BABA stock looks overdone. Alibaba boasts unmatched scale and branding in China through juggernauts like Taobao and Tmall. Its logistics arm, Cainiao, provides enormous competitive advantages in a market with over 1 billion consumers.In previous years, Alibaba underwent a major management shakeup, streamlining operations under new leadership with founder Jack Ma stepping down. The company is now refocusing on revitalizing e-commerce and cloud computing growth, its core competencies. Alibaba is also investing heavily in AI initiatives to drive the next stage of growth in areas like shopping and enterprise services.Meanwhile, China has instituted fresh stimulus measures to bolster its economy, which should provide a tailwind for BABA stock. Alibaba generates over $29 billion in annual free cash flow, giving the company plenty of financial strength to weather near-term headwinds. I believe the Chinese giant is too cheap to ignore right now.Sure, the Chinese economy might be somewhat weak right now, but I don’t expect this weakness to last. Accordingly, the $142 consensus price target implies 62% upside over the next year.AT&amp;T (T)A digital illustration of the telecom industry.Source: ShutterstockLegacy telecom stalwart AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has been dragged down to bargain basement prices not seen since the early 1980s. Pummeled by cord-cutting pressures and the costly 5G network rollout, the stock now trades at just 6.2-times forward earnings, with a hefty 7.2% dividend yield. I don’t think this dividend will last too long, given the company’s cost-cutting actions. However, AT&amp;T still boasts valuable assets and growth drivers, making it a strong turnaround play.The company retains a wireless subscriber base of 222 million, along with 15.4 million broadband connections. AT&amp;T is aggressively expanding its fiber optic network, enabling the company to take broadband market share from cable. The company also continues streamlining operations and paying down debt from past acquisitions.While AT&amp;T does have substantial debt, its strong free cash flows provide coverage to sustain its dividend and invest in 5G. With interest rates set to decline in coming years, refinancing costs for AT&amp;T’s debt load will ease. Indeed, T stock may take years to return to its previous peaks, but investors can collect a juicy dividend yield while waiting for a long-term recovery in this name. This telecom giant is simply too cheap to pass up on right now, in my view.PNC Financial Services (PNC)bank stocks Hand inserting ATM card into bank machine to withdraw moneySource: totojang1977 / Shutterstock.comPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) operates one of America’s most extensive banking franchises, with more than 2,500 branches spread across 28 states. However, the stock has tumbled recently to around $125 per share, nearly matching its pandemic lows back in 2020. I think this presents a compelling buying opportunity.While economic uncertainties have weighed on bank stocks, these fears are overblown in PNC’s case. The company has limited exposure to risky sectors and maintains strong underwriting standards. Notably, PNC’s balance sheet is rock-solid, recently receiving the minimum 2.5% stress capital buffer from the Fed.With over $558 billion in assets, PNC boasts tremendous scale advantages that enhance its profitability. The bank continues taking market share, particularly in fast-growing regions like the Southeast. Once the economy stabilizes, PNC is capable of returning to strong earnings growth. However, shares trade at just 10-times forward earnings, far below historical multiples.With that in mind, the Fall months present a prime opening to grab these promising stocks while they remain undiscovered and attractively priced. Their upside potential heading into 2023 is too significant to ignore.Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) stock has taken a beating in 2023, plunging over 53% year-to-date. The company has faced execution issues, including challenges ramping up labor, managing inventory, and combating higher shrinkage levels. This has weighed on sales and profits, with earnings per share declining 28.5% in Q2.However, the negativity around Dollar General looks overblown. This is a high-quality business with a leading position in the attractive dollar store industry. Dollar stores stand to benefit as the consumer comes under pressure from factors like inflation and rising interest rates. Value and convenience become more important, playing right into Dollar General’s wheelhouse. Despite the company’s recent operational stumbles, Dollar General still grew net sales by 4% in Q2, driven by unit share gains across categories. Management is keenly focused on improving execution by adding labor hours, optimizing inventory, and upgrading technology and processes.While this creates near-term pressure, it will better-position Dollar General for the long-run. The company can regain its track record of consistent mid-single-digit comparable sales growth and double-digit earnings per share gains once execution normalizes.Right now, Dollar General trades at just 14.4-times forward earnings, far below its historical average of roughly 20-times. This is an excellent entry point for a high-quality business that offers massive upside potential once execution recovers. Investors should take advantage of Dollar General’s plunge to gain exposure to a long-term winner.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockAdvance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) operates in the large, fragmented, $448 billion automotive aftermarket parts industry. This market benefits from consistent demand drivers, including the aging of the average car on the road, and rising vehicle miles driven. The average vehicle age now exceeds 12.5 years, an all-time high.This bodes well for demand at auto parts retailers like Advance Auto Parts. Maintenance and repair costs rise as vehicles age, driving more spending on parts. At the same time, stretched consumer budgets will lead more people to repair rather than replace their aging vehicles, further lifting parts demand.Advance Auto Parts is executing initiatives to expand margins and gain a share in this growing market. The company is adding new higher-margin private label brands, ramping up its commercial program, and optimizing its supply chain and inventory management.While inflationary pressures have temporarily weighed on sales and margins this year, Advance Auto Parts has levers to expand profits over time. The company sees a long runway for new store growth in under-penetrated markets, and significant potential to improve stagnant same-store sales growth. Despite the bearish sentiment on Wall Street, I believe this company is poised to recover. Gurufocus’ model puts the fair price of the stock at $210.Arhaus (ARHS)Furnished officeSource: ShutterstockThe furniture industry has faced significant challenges from factors like supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. However, upscale furniture purveyors like Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) have proven more resilient amidst the challenging backdrop.Arhaus sells premium artisan-crafted furniture priced in the four-digit-plus range, on average. The company focuses on affluent consumers in the upper-middle and above-income brackets. Despite inflationary pressures, these customers have maintained their spending.That has shown up in Arhaus’ impressive recent results. In Q2, the company grew net revenue by 2.2% and adjusted EBITDA by 5% year-over-year. Thus, I believe Arhaus is well positioned to capitalize on the strength among affluent consumers. The company is rapidly expanding its showroom footprint, aiming to add five to seven new showrooms per year. Its omnichannel model enables seamless integration between e-commerce and physical showrooms.Strong demand also has Arhaus on pace to generate over $1.27 billion in net revenue in 2023. That said, the U.S. premium home furnishings market offers an additional $100 billion revenue opportunity. With affluent consumers poised to keep spending on furnishing their homes, Arhaus has a long growth runway ahead. I believe the stock deserves a much more premium valuation, and the average analyst price target at $14.60 implies some pretty impressive 50%-plus upside potential over the next year.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

High interest rates and remote work’s newfound permanence in corporate culture combine to make commercial real estate a tough sell. As a category, U.S. REITs fell 50% since 2021, with commercial real estate suffering the most. Although some real estate sectors are bouncing back, like residential mortgage REITs, commercial real estate remains in a slump. Critical geographic sectors like Silicon Valley and Manhattan are seeing record-high vacancy rates as fewer corporate clients elect to renew leases. In some cases, companies are even terminating leases early to cut costs in a high-rate climate.But taking advantage of a turbulent commercial real estate market isn’t just about shorting REITs. That’s certainly an option, but additional opportunities exist for investors willing to take on more risk. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSell: Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockCommercial and office REIT Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) owns and operates almost 200 properties throughout the Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas. Unsurprisingly, this REIT is the most affected by the commercial real estate slump. True to form, its share price declined nearly 25% over the past year. But the pain likely isn’t over. In fact, average office occupancy is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels as workers push (and mostly get) a remote-centric office culture. In New York alone, office real estate values dropped 45% in 2020 and continued falling to a record-setting $453 billion loss. Likewise, San Francisco commercial real estate remains 30% vacant, a trend doubtlessly accelerated by the massive crime wave affecting the city. And yet, this represents only two of Boston Properties’ core sectors. BXP’s funds from operations, an alternative to earnings per share for REITs, are declining steadily. They marked at $1.86 per share in its most recent filing, compared to $1.94 the previous year. Although the report surprised analysts, beating expectations by about 3%, it did little to assuage their concerns. Story continuesToday, analysts remain overwhelmingly bearish on BXP, with most calling the stock a hold. But, this recommendation is hinging on hopes of interest rate improvement. Yet, as the Fed announced this week, higher rates are here to stay – which doesn’t bode well for Boston Properties.  Buy: WeWork (WE)Image of WeWork (WE) logo on the side of a glass building.Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comThis stock pick might come as a surprise considering it’s admittedly terrible performance in recent years. But WeWork (NYSE:WE) is uniquely positioned to capitalize on two key factors in today’s commercial real estate market. Those would be vacancies and remote workers’ need to physically relocate away from their home. Workers typically face far more distraction at home than in an office setting. More remote workers are trending towards establishing their own “office away from home” to remain productive.True, WeWork is in terrible shape as it faced delisting in past months, raised bankruptcy concerns. Late last month, a team of institutional investor giants, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) began exploring restructuring options in a bid to save WeWork. If entities as monolithic and forward-thinking as BlackRock believe WeWork has a future in today’s commercial real estate market, despite gross mismanagement, this may be an opportunity for retail investors to jump in pre-acquisition. Today, WeWork is priced at the bottom of the barrel, with its stock hitting a 0.03 price-to-sales ratio. Hinging investment hopes on a possible buyout isn’t usually a good play. Still, WeWork’s price is tough to beat considering its potential upside in the changing remote work world.   Buy: Newmark Group (NMRK)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockWhen major corporations face major difficulty, third-party consultants are usually called in to navigate shifting winds. And Newmark Group (NASDAQ:NMRK) is one of the few commercial real estate firms positioned to take advantage of of that trend. They’re uniquely positioned in the short term. Even if their clients go bankrupt or dissolve commercial real estate holdings, Newmark still collects hefty advisory fees. And Newmark is the primary player in the space, evidenced by their recent advisory role to BlackStone (NYSE:BX) as they explored selling opportunities for a hefty commercial real estate portfolio. Newmark is also priced to buy, trading at a 0.94 price-to-book ratio (meaning it trades lower than its net assets). That alone makes NMRK a value play at today’s prices.An executive commitment to shareholder value reinforces Newmark’s value status. The company both issues dividends and runs a comprehensive buyback program. Today, Newmark’s total yield is 13.60% and 66% payout ratio.

This may put these commodities in an area of value for traders. Meanwhile, traders might also want to opt for sugar if they're looking for current commodities strength.Russia's occupation of the Black Sea is no longer pushing prices upward as agricultural commodity prices have been trending lower for most of the year. Keeping them afloat has been harsh weather conditions from El Nino climate patterns, which has been creating droughts in certain parts of the globe.""Competitive Black Sea supplies weighed on prices, though concern over dry weather in Australia and Argentina limited losses,"" said U.K.'s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board analysts, mentioning that a strong U.S. dollar also was a factor for corn and soybean prices.For plays on corn, traders can consider the Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN). The fund tracks three futures contracts for corn traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. It includes 35% second to expire contracts, 30% third to expire contracts, and 35% December following the third to expire. The various contract exposures help the fund limit the negative effects of rolling contracts, especially during a market in contango.For traders looking for opportunities in soybeans, consider the Teucrium Soybean Fund (SOYB). It can essentially provide similar exposure to what investors could obtain by trading in soybean futures contracts themselves. This offers short-term traders or longer-term buy-and-hold investors easy ingress regarding soybean price exposure.Corn, Soybean Prices Lower, But Sugar Likely to Stay HighCommodities traders looking for bullish plays may want to continue sticking with sugar. Supply and demand forces should result in higher prices, which is likely to stay elevated as the world's top sugar producer, India, will lower its output.Story continuesAdditionally, with Halloween just around the corner, consumer demand for candy should also provide an additional catalyst for higher sugar prices. According to a Reuters report, French trading group Sucden forecasted that sugar could trade between 22 and 30 cents per pound in in the next year.""Prices are probably going to stay strong,"" said Jeremy Austin, general director of Sucden Brazil.ETF investors looking to add sugar to their portfolios may want to look at the Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE). It is the only sugar ETF option available on the market. The fund seeks to have the daily changes in the NAV of the fund’s shares reflect the daily changes in the market for future delivery.CANE uses a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for No. 11 Sugar. All three of these trade on the ICE Futures US. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal market conditions in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Commodities Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs BlackRock Lists Active Equity Premium Income ETFCapital Group Lists 5 New Active ETFsCapital Group Provides Advisors Ability to Manage Risk ToleranceDimensional Launches Ultrashort Fixed Income and World Equity ETFsChart of the Week: Making Tactical Moves With ETFsREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM &gt;]"

(NYSE:VZ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Verizon Communications' shares before the 6th of October in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.67 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$2.61 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Verizon Communications has a trailing yield of approximately 8.2% on its current stock price of $32.41. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Verizon Communications paid out 52% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Verizon Communications generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (88%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's positive to see that Verizon Communications's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Verizon Communications's 7.5% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Verizon Communications has delivered 2.6% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Verizon Communications? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least Verizon Communications's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Verizon Communications.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Verizon Communications don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Verizon Communications and understanding them should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$170 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$142. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Genuine Parts' current trading price of US$144 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Genuine Parts’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts What Is Genuine Parts Worth?Great news for investors – Genuine Parts is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $220.29, but it is currently trading at US$144 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Genuine Parts’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Genuine Parts look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Genuine Parts' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GPC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GPC for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GPC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

(AP) — The legal fights between Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis ratcheted up this week.The Florida governor asked that the company's First Amendment lawsuit against him be tossed from federal court, and Disney demanded emails, texts and other communications from the governor's office in a separate state court lawsuit originally brought by DeSantis appointees of Walt Disney World's governing district.The legal filings marked an escalation in the battle between the entertainment giant and DeSantis, a candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. The confrontation started last year when Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, and DeSantis retaliated by taking over the governing district that provides municipal services for the 25,000-acre (10,117-hectare) Disney World theme park resort in Florida.Disney has sued DeSantis in federal court, claiming the governor violated its free speech rights by punishing it for expressing opposition to the law.On Thursday, DeSantis and the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, the governing district made up of DeSantis appointees, asked a federal judge to throw out Disney’s First Amendment lawsuit, calling it meritless and “a last-ditch effort to reinstate its corporate kingdom.”“Although Disney has grabbed headlines by suing the Governor, Disney — like many litigants before it who have challenged Florida’s laws — has no basis for doing so,” DeSantis' motion said.Meanwhile, the governing district now controlled by DeSantis appointees has sued Disney in state court. The suit is an attempt to void prior agreements, made before the DeSantis appointees took over, that shifted control over design and construction to Disney from the district and prohibited the district from using the likeness of Disney characters or other intellectual property without Disney's permission. Disney filed counterclaims that include asking a state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. The company amended those counterclaims on Thursday, saying the DeSantis-controlled district was in violation of the U.S. Constitution stipulations on contracts and due process.Story continuesDisney also sent a notice to DeSantis' office demanding internal communications, including text messages and emails, and documents regarding the district's comprehensive plan, the development agreements and the legislation that shifted control of the district to DeSantis. The notice said a subpoena would be issued requiring the governor's office to turn over the materials to Disney's attorneys by Oct. 27.The Disney attorneys also sent notices of subpoenas to others, including similar special districts in Florida. Disney wants to show that the manner in which it gave public notice about the agreements which stripped the DeSantis allies of design and construction powers was consistent with what other districts do. The DeSantis allies are arguing that one of the reasons the agreements should be invalidated is they weren't properly publicized.In response to the demand for communications and documents, the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District said that some of Disney's requests were “overbroad, unduly oppressive, and an improper fishing expedition.”___Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Under Armour with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Under Armour Under Armour's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Under Armour has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Under Armour's EPS grew from US$0.36 to US$0.87, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 138% year-on-year growth like that.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Under Armour achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 2.6% to US$5.9b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Under Armour's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Under Armour Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Under Armour followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$344m. Coming in at 12% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Should You Add Under Armour To Your Watchlist?Under Armour's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Under Armour very closely. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Under Armour.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Newell Brands (NWL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking the Risks of Newell BrandsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newell Brands should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.65. These indicators suggest that Newell Brands, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesA Closer Look at Newell BrandsNewell Brands Inc is an American global consumer goods company. The business activities of the group function through five segments namely, Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, Outdoor and Recreation. The learning and Development segment generates most of the revenue for the firm which offers baby gear and infant care products; writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; activity-based adhesive and cutting products, and labeling solutions.Is Newell Brands (NWL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Newell Brands's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Newell Brands's Altman Z-score reveals Newell Brands's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:Conclusion: Is Newell Brands a Value Trap?Given the analysis, it's clear that while Newell Brands presents an attractive valuation, its low Altman Z-Score indicates potential financial distress. This raises concerns about its viability as a value investment, suggesting that it might indeed be a value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in Newell Brands.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
73,39f75ce6-8f4e-30cc-a920-92db2aa01763,AXP,2023-10-01,American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 65% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-nyse-axp-130019318.html,1696078819,STORY,['AXP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies American Express' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 12 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Express. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 21% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.4% and 6.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$154m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over American Express. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 21% of the American Express shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Family members, neighbors and passersby would be drawn in by the strong aroma of fresh beans roasting in a pot, often made by his mother or another family member.Regardless of who they were, all were welcome.And this tradition wasn’t limited to the morning. Coffee, or buna in Amharic, is typically drunk at the end of each meal. Drinking coffee was a communal experience for Markos, so when he first immigrated to London from Ethiopia 23 years ago, the culture shock hit hard.“They sell our coffee in Starbucks and other places but they don’t follow our traditions,” said Markos, who has owned Kaffa Coffee since 2004. The shop, now in the East London neighborhood of Dalton, hosts coffee ceremonies every weekend in the summer, as well as during cultural events year round, and special orders.“Tourists will walk by and smell the coffee and come in asking questions,” Markos said. “It makes people want to learn more about the culture.”Markos said that when he moved to London, in 2000, he didn’t see any Ethiopian coffee shops; now, there are more than a dozen all over a city where tea, its counterpart, has been a staple for centuries. Ethiopian coffee has made similar inroads in cities around the world.Among some of the most popular Ethiopian-origin coffee types are the floral Yirgacheffe, fruity Limu and nutty Kochere.AN ANCIEN T TRADITIONMarkos named Kaffa after the southwestern region in Ethiopia where coffee beans are believed to have been discovered around AD 800. Traditional accounts say an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats acting strangely one day after eating berries from a tree. He tried them himself, and felt energized and alert. Kaldi took the berries to a monk, who threw them in a fire, calling them the work of the devil.A strong aroma was released, and the monks saved the remnants of the burnt beans, putting them in a jug with hot water. When they drank the concoction, they realized it helped them stay awake during nightly devotions and prayers.Story continuesOver the years, coffee-making in Ethiopia has evolved into full-on ceremonies led by the women in a household.“The social value of the coffee ceremony is one of our biggest traditions,” Markos said.HOW THE COFFEE GETS MADEFresh beans are roasted in a pot for a few minutes before being passed around, so everyone can inhale the flavorful fumes. They are then ground down to a powder and placed inside a jebena, or Ethiopian coffee pot, traditionally made of clay, on top of a stove.While the coffee is being made, itan, or frankincense, is burned to enhance the already aromatic process. Once the kettle comes to a boil several times, the coffee is served in a small cup called a sini.INTERNATIONAL COFFEE DAYAlmost a decade ago, the International Coffee Organization, which has 77 member countries and is headquartered in London, officially marked Oct. 1 as International Coffee Day. This year, the theme is the promotion of a safe and healthy working environment in the coffee supply chain.The London Coffee Festival, started in 2011, also provides an occasion for coffee lovers to come together. Anteneh Mulu, co-owner of The Ethiopian Coffee Company shop in central London, credits the festival with helping to promote Ethiopian coffee to a new community.Mulu, 46, and his business partner Polly Hamilton, 79, opened their shop in 2013. Like Kaffa Coffee, they import directly from Ethiopia, where beans are often named after the region they were grown in — paying homage to the motherland in name and practice.As Ethiopia's traditions spread outside the country, both Markos and Mulu hope more people will be encouraged to prioritize community over caffeine while drinking coffee.]"
79,3450c769-d9fc-392c-a774-c1d953ee2f46,COF,2023-10-01,Luckin Coffee: A Fascinating Turnaround Story,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/luckin-coffee-fascinating-turnaround-story-022933961.html,1696127373,STORY,"['LKNCY', 'GC=F', 'KC=F']","[Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) was founded in June 2017. It has since become the largest coffee chain in China with more than 12,000 stores. The companys previous management team defrauded investors in 2020 which resulted in Luckins delisting from Nasdaq. After the delisting, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) went through two years of debt restructuring, change of management team, and the settlement with the SEC. Today Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) has emerged as a much better and stronger business.Under-penetration of Chinas Coffee MarketWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with LKNCY. Click here to check it out. LKNCY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LKNCYAccording to Deloitte, in 2021, the per capita annual coffee consumption in mainland China was only 9 cups, much less than Japan, U.S and South Korea, which has per capita annual coffee consumption of 280 cups, 329 cups and 367 cups each. The per capita annual coffee consumption in mainland China is only 3.21% of Japan's, 2.74% of the United States', and 2.45% of South Korea's.Luckin Coffee: A Fascinating Turnaround StoryEven in Shanghai, which has the highest per capita consumption of coffee in mainland China, the current per capita coffee consumption is merely over 20 cups per year. Whats more interesting is that Deloitte found that of habitual coffee drinkers, more than 50% are constantly increasing their coffee consumption, thereby developing a coffee drinking habit. Consumers in 1st-tier cities, in particular, are becoming more dependent on coffee, and are now more likely to consume more cups of freshly brewed coffee.Luckin Coffee: A Fascinating Turnaround StoryClearly, China still has great potential in per capita coffee consumption, the industry is far from mature.Business Models in Chinas Coffee MarketWithin Chinas freshly brewed coffee market, there are mainly five types of business models: large store, small store pick-up, boutique chain, fast food stores, and convenience stores.Starbucks dominates the large store segment with almost 6,600 stores. Tim Hortons have grown rapidly in China with more than 700 stores. COSTA, Peets Coffee and Lavazza are other major players in the large store segment. The large store model requires heavy up-front capital expenditure and high operating cost. Therefore, they charge more for their products. One cup of coffee costs between 30 and 40 yuan for the large coffee chains.Story continuesBoutique chains focus on quality and charge less than the large chains. Major players include Manner, M-Stand, Seesaw, and Arabica. These chains often feature Nordic style design and a simplified menu. These boutique shops mostly operate in tier-1 and top tier-2 cities. Shanghai is the most important market. Currently the biggest two players are Manner, which has more than 500 stores, and M-stand which has almost 400 stores. Boutique chains customers are very sensitive to the taste and flavor of coffee. After discount, one cup of coffee costs between 18 and 30 yuan.The Small Store SegmentThe small store segment is very different. The shops are small and often only offer pick-up services. Both up-front capital investment and operating cost are low. Although they are branded as coffee shops, their products are often called beverage coffee because they are a combination of milk-tea and coffee. One cup of coffee costs between 9 and 18 yuan. Although Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) dominates this market, competition has picked up.Fast food stores mostly sell cheap to-go coffees that customers order with food. They dont really compete with the other three types of coffee shops.Convenient stores such as 7-Eleven and Family Mart also sell cheap to-go coffees. One cup of Americano costs between 6-10 yuan. Undoubtedly, they offers a very compelling value proposition for many consumers but customers cant pre-order on their smartphones.To sum up, Chinese coffee market has five major segments. Each segment has its own consumption characteristics and competitive landscape. Although Starbucks and Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) both sell coffee, they are completely different businesses. Since this article is about Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY), Ill write more about the small-store segment and Luckins competitive advantages in this space.Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY)s Dominance in the Small-Store SpaceAs mentioned above, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) dominates the small-store space of Chinas coffee market. Before the accounting scandal, Luckin was even more dominating. But Luckin had to halt its business expansion for a few months after the scandal. Luckins competitors such NOWWA Coffee and Xingyunka grabbed the opportunity and expanded rapidly. However, neither NOWWA nor Xingyunka posed serious threats to Luckin. After resuming expansion plan, Luckin quickly regained market share and remains the dominant position.Luckins Competitive AdvantagesThe reason why Luckin can still dominate the small-store segment is that Luckin has a few competitive advantages against its competitors.First of all, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) has successfully established a brand image of young, modern and energetic. Luckin partnered with celebrities such as beloved Chinas singer Han Lu and winter Olympic gold-medalist Aileen Gu in its advertising campaigns. Both Han Lu and Aileen Gu are young, energetic and successful.Secondly, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) has a research lab of more than 60 employees. Their job is to develop and optimize different flavors as quickly as possible. This research lab enables Luckin to come up with blockbuster products such as Newer Latte, Coconuts Latte and the recently launched Sauce-flavored Maotai Latte. For flavored latte, there is clearly a first-mover advantage. Luckins competitors have tried to copy Luckins Coconuts Latte but none is successful. Consumers clearly have associated Coconuts Latte with Luckins brand.Thirdly, because of the first-mover advantage, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) has occupied the best locations for its directly-owned stores. And Luckins brand has attracted the best franchisees because Luckins shops are much more profitable than competitors shops.Last but not least, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) has built its own large and complex supply chain. This gives Luckin an enormous scale advantage in terms of raw material and equipment procurement.Luckins Response to New CompetitorsLuckins moat was tested recently with the emergence of a very formidable new competitor. In November 2022, the man who was responsible for Luckins fraud, namely Zhengyao Lu, founded another coffee brand called Cotti Coffee to compete against Luckin. Within less a year, Cotti has opened almost 6000 stores across China. Cotti basically copied Luckins playbook and started a pricing war with Luckin. Cottis price was 3-4 yuan less than Luckin in its early expansion stage.Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) was caught off-guard by Cottis rise. But on June 5th, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) announced its own weekly 9.9 yuan coupon event, placing significant pressure on Cotti. In consumers mind, Luckin deserves a pricing premium over Cotti. Therefore, Luckin can constantly charge a small premium. This makes it impractical for Cotti to keep lowering the price. After Luckins response, Cotti is rapidly losing momentum.Furthermore, Luckins recent partnership with Maotai solidified Luckins lead in the game. Luckins Maotai Latte sold more than 5 million cups on its first day of launch and brought in more than 100 million yuan of revenue. Luckins partnership with Maotai is exclusive. Therefore, Cotti wont be able to copy Luckins blockbuster product this time.ConclusionLuckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY)s turnaround is one of the most fascinating business case studies in recent years. The business restructuring and SEC settlement has made Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) better and stronger. With Chinas growing coffee market and Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY)s competitive advantages, Luckin Coffee Inc (LKNCY) is well-positioned to continue to grow in the next few years.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The term refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) that’s produced and the amount that’s removed from the atmosphere.Wind power is a viable solution to achieving this goal. The best wind stocks are the ones that can produce, install, and sell wind power in the volume and scale to meet an exponentially increasing demand. This clean energy presents a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the explosive growth still to come. Let’s explore some of the best wind stocks to buy now.NextEra Energy (NEE)An image of engineers analyzing wind turbines over the hill, data imposed over the imageSource: ConceptCafe/ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the world’s dominant provider of renewable energy which foresees a rapid rise in wind power. NextEra believes that wind and solar will continue to drop in price, far below any other energy source in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith a staggering 119 wind farms currently in operation, NextEra stands out as a leader in harnessing wind energy’s potential. In Texas, NextEra is signing deals to sell energy to steel manufacturers. This move promises decarbonization for an intensely polluting industry. And in Oregon, NEE is investing in wind and solar power plus battery storage, the holy grail of renewable energy. This trifecta assures that NextEra will be able to continually supply clean power to the grid.Financially, NextEra’s strong position is evident in their most recent earnings report. It showed revenue growth from $5.2 billion to $7.3 billion, more than a 40% expansion year over year (YOY). Their net income fared even better, going from $1.1 billion to $2.6 billion, more than 100% growth YOY.With NextEra’s continued innovation, wind energy may soon be cheaper than all carbon-based energy sources, making them a wind stock to buy now.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comStory continuesGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is solidifying its position as a key player in the wind power industry.It recently made investments to manufacture wind turbines in New York. Additionally, GE is rolling out massive 17- and 18-megawatt turbines as well. These larger turbines will be necessary to help nations achieve their net zero climate goals.Further, General Electric is particularly notable for its global reach in wind energy. For example, it is developing an offshore wind power grid infrastructure in the Netherlands and Germany. Also, GE is pursuing typhoon certification in Japan for permission to build off-shore wind energy.Financially, General Electric’s steady growth is reflected in their most recent earnings report, showing revenue increase from $14.1 to $16.7 billion YOY. However, the black spot on this report though is that the renewable sector is growing fast but still not profitable. Renewable energy revenue went from $3.1 to $3.8 billion, a growth of over 20%. But renewable energy still lost $359 million in the quarter.General Electric’s highly diverse portfolio makes it one of the best wind stocks for any investor.Eneti (NETI)Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comEneti (NYSE:NETI) specializes in the installation of offshore wind power and the needed infrastructure to support it.Recently, NETI signed a vessel reservation agreement, valued at $350 thousand per day. And it announced a merger with fellow wind provider Cadeler with the resulting company being traded on both the NYSE and Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE).In fact, Eneti’s most recent earnings report showed revenue of $38.8 million and GAAP net loss of $49.3 million dollars. Meanwhile Cadeler’s most recent earnings report shows revenue of about $72 million dollars and profit of about $31 million dollars, assuming current exchange rates.Truthfully, Eneti remains a speculative play, but it has a strong niche in the wind energy market. The installation of wind energy is set to grow enormously in the coming years, and if Eneti and Cadeler can grab just a piece of it, together they’ll be one of the best wind stocks to own.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Valero Energy's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:41% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.41.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 41% ROETo begin with, Valero Energy has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 28% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 36% net income growth seen by Valero Energy over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesWe then compared Valero Energy's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 28% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for VLO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Valero Energy has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 13%, meaning that it has the remaining 87% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Valero Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 42% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 12%) over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Valero Energy's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Debt?As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at June 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But it also has US$8.93b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$6.95b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.10b due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.54b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.93b as well as receivables valued at US$5.12b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$7.41b more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesThe modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 38% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 69% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has US$6.95b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. The cherry on top was that in converted 69% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$3.0b. So we are not troubled with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's debt use. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's earnings per share history for free.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?
