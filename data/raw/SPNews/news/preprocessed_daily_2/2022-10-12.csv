2,68bbafc4-9c2f-38be-9c9f-a18c7723c2fb,SCHW,2022-10-12,"Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interactive-brokers-group-inc-ibkr-140002121.html,1665496802,STORY,"['IBKR', 'SCHW']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.9%.Revenues are expected to be $815.1 million, up 75.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.For Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.84, delivering a surprise of -7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +23.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.4 billion, up 18.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Charles Schwab Corporation has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SWHFX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWHFX. Schwab Health Care Fund debuted in June of 2000. Since then, SWHFX has accumulated assets of about $840 million, according to the most recently available information. Wei Li is the fund's current manager and has held that role since June of 2013.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 8.19%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 10.61%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWHFX over the past three years is 15.78% compared to the category average of 19.26%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 14.95% compared to the category average of 18.44%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.71, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -0.36, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWHFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.80% compared to the category average of 1.29%. SWHFX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Health Care Fund ( SWHFX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

After the stock price dropped 7.1% last week, the company's market value declined by US$11b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Richard Templeton, for US$5.9m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$153. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Texas Instruments didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Texas Instruments Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. In total, Senior Vice President of Sales &amp; Applications Mark Roberts sold US$364k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Texas Instruments insiders own about US$154m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Texas Instruments stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Texas Instruments is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.

(NYSE: ARE), the first, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer uniquely focused on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, is deeply committed to making a distinctive impact through its eight social responsibility pillars to address some of today's most urgent and widespread societal challenges, including (1) disease and other threats to human health and well-being, (2) hunger and food insecurity, (3) opioid addiction, (4) deficiencies in support services for the military and their families, (5) disparities in educational and character-building opportunities, (6) homelessness, (7) the loss of our nation's historical memory and (8) the rapidly growing mental health and suicide crisis. Through its first core pillar, Alexandria aims to accelerate groundbreaking medical innovation to advance vitally needed therapies for the over 10,000 diseases known to humankind, of which less than 10% are addressable with current therapies, and countless medical disorders, including autism. In 2021, 1 in 44 children in the United States were identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), an increase of 241% from baseline estimates established in 2000 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With more than 5.4 million adults already living with ASD in the United States today, this number will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years. Alexandria has been forging deep and strategically supportive partnerships with highly impactful organizations, like NEXT for AUTISM, that are researching and developing innovative support services for people with ASD.

Unlike most autism organizations that engage in advocacy or fund scientific research, NEXT for AUTISM addresses the immediate and future needs of people with autism and their families. The non-profit has worked with organizations to improve access to effective support services that promote a high-quality life for autistic individuals focused on four key areas: home, work, social life, and health and well-being. It also established a 15-member advisory board comprising autistic and neurotypical professionals in 2021, which weighs in on relevant topics directly affecting autistic adults and provides insight into opportunities for the improvement and growth of the non-profit's programs. In 2023, NEXT for AUTISM will celebrate its 20th anniversary. Since its founding, it has raised over $54 million and supported programming in over 36 states and U.S. territories. The non-profit continues its work to expand systemwide capacity for people with autism, including by coordinating services across agencies and disciplines, sharing expertise and developing technology, such as platforms and analytics dashboards, to measure the progress of an autistic individual's mental health, ability to make choices and overall well-being.""Alexandria is immensely proud to partner with NEXT for AUTISM and help advance its mission to provide vital services and develop innovative programs to support autistic people and their families,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments.

10,826f8808-41be-3311-8219-dc7e03af58ed,UNM,2022-10-12,Why Unum (UNM) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unum-unm-top-dividend-154503512.html,1665503103,STORY,['UNM'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusHeadquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 68.58% so far this year. The insurance company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.19%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.69% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 12.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.28%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 23%, which means it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for UNM for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $6.13 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 40.92%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNM presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

11,ba501190-a74f-37b8-a87a-a5097f10bf22,STT,2022-10-12,Earnings Preview: State Street Corporation (STT) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-state-street-corporation-140002221.html,1665496802,STORY,['STT'],"[The market expects State Street Corporation (STT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10%.Revenues are expected to be $3.01 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $1.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.94, delivering a surprise of +10.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.18 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has been revised 1.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.15%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PVH) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PVH What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$77.3mUS$713.7m-US$60.0mUS$545.0mUS$586.0mUS$608.5mUS$628.4mUS$646.5mUS$663.5mUS$679.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.62%Est @ 2.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% -US$70.3US$590-US$45.1US$373US$365US$344US$323US$303US$282US$263(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.7bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$680m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.0%) = US$8.7bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$8.7b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$3.4bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$6.1b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$48.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PVH as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.705. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

While USB’s earnings are likely to have declined year over year, revenues are expected to have improved.Before we analyze the factors that are expected to have impacted the third-quarter earnings, let’s look at U.S. Bancorp’s performance over the last few quarters.In the last reported quarter, USB’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on an increase in revenues, average loan growth and lower non-performing assets. However, higher expenses and elevated provisions for credit losses were the offsetting factors.U.S. Bancorp has a decent surprise history. Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 4.2%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteUSB’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $1.16 has moved marginally south in the past month. Also, the figure indicates a 10.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.27 billion, suggesting growth of 6.9% from the year-ago reported figure. Management expects total revenue growth of 3-5%.Key Factors to NoteNII: The bank’s NII and margins are likely to have been driven by the 150-basis-point interest rate hikes. Per the Fed’s latest data, loan growth continued at a decent pace in the to-be-reported quarter, with commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderating in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the third quarter. This is likely to have supported USB’S loan balances, which comprise 50% of commercial loans.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $541.9 billion for the quarterly average interest-earning assets indicates a marginal sequential improvement. The estimate for NII suggests an 8.5% sequential increase to $3.72 billion.Story continuesNon-Interest Income Heightening volatility, uncertainty, recession fears and geopolitical tensions dampened the equity market performance. Amid this, disruptions in capital market activities are anticipated to have hindered commercial product revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp's commercial product revenues indicates a 4% sequential decline.Mortgage rates increased sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossing the 6% mark in September. This is expected to have led to a sharp decline in refinance originations. Amid such industry headwinds, management projects mortgage revenues to decline 30-35% on a sequential basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $141 million, suggesting a marginal fall from the prior quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for trust and investment management fees is pegged at $563 million, indicating a marginal decline, likely due to unfavorable market conditions.The elimination of certain fees and lower deposit balances are likely to have affected service charges. The consensus mark of $162 million indicates a 1.8% fall in revenues from service charges on deposits.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total non-interest income is pegged at $2.5 billion, suggesting a marginal decrease from the prior quarter’s reported number.Expenses: As USB continues to invest in digital initiatives, payments capabilities and technology modernization, we believe that such rising costs have weighed on its expense base to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter and hindered bottom-line growth. Management expects core expenses (excluding merger and integration charges related to the MUFG Union Bank buyout) to increase 2-3% sequentially and $50 million of merger integration costs.Key Development During the QuarterUSB’s acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise has been extended, with deal conversion and integration being pushed to Memorial Day weekend from President’s Day weekend.Owing to this, management expects to achieve only 40-50% of the expected $900-million cost savings from the acquisition in 2023, down from the original expectation of 75% in 2023.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for U.S. Bancorp this season.

18,70c5c704-e4b2-39eb-8329-cdf7f824d1d3,CF,2022-10-12,CF (CF) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-cf-incredible-growth-stock-164504861.html,1665506704,STORY,['CF'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.CF Industries (CF) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this fertilizer maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for CF is 75.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 355.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 165.4%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for CF is 90.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 82.6%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 24% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 22.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for CF have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.7% over the past month.Bottom LineCF has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions CF well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is well-placed to benefit from the rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and higher nitrogen prices.We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to the portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let's see what makes this this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock an attractive investment option at the moment.An OutperformerShares of CF Industries have popped 74.9% over a year compared with the 26.2% rise of its industry. It has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 17.1% decline over the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates NorthboundOver the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CF Industries for 2022 has increased around 0.7%. The consensus estimate for third-quarter 2022 has also been revised 1.4% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.Solid Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current year for CF Industries is currently pegged at $19.31, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 355.4%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 267.7% growth in the third quarter.Superior Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for CF Industries is 49.1%, above the industry’s level of 31.6%.Growth Drivers in PlaceCF Industries is gaining from strong nitrogen fertilizer demand. Global demand for nitrogen is expected to remain strong in 2022. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.The company, on its second-quarter call, said that it sees the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to remain tight for the foreseeable future, supported by resilient agricultural-led demand and uncertainty about global production and export supply availability. Energy spreads between low-cost producers and marginal production in Europe and Asia also expected to remain historically wide.CF Industries expects nitrogen demand for industrial use in North America to be supported by mining activity. It also envisions India to tender on a regular basis into 2023 as higher domestic production is unlikely to fully meet increased demand as growers boost grain production. The company also envisions urea consumption in Brazil to remain strong this year, backed by high crop prices, expected high planted corn acres and improved farm incomes.The company is also benefiting from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates globally due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are driving its sales as witnessed in the last-reported quarter. The positive pricing environment is expected to continue moving ahead. Global nitrogen supply is expected to remain challenged due to higher energy prices and geopolitical factors.Story continuesCF Industries Holdings, Inc.

(CF) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cf-industries-130001762.html,1665493201,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +7.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which CF falls in, has lost 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $3.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +267.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +355.4%. This estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.20 indicates a change of -16.1% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +79.6%. The $11.78 billion and $10.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +80.1% and -14.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $3.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +113.4%. EPS of $6.19 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.27%. The EPS surprise was +2.15%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

22,e20cdda4-dcdd-3822-85fb-bbdc054082ce,CTAS,2022-10-12,The Trend Of High Returns At Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Has Us Very Interested,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trend-high-returns-cintas-nasdaq-181733313.html,1665512253,STORY,['CTAS'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Cintas, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$8.3b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).So, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.0% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas roceIn the above chart we have measured Cintas' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCintas has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 58% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAs discussed above, Cintas appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And a remarkable 179% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Cintas and understanding it should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Always low prices. But the price of the stock is up on a note from Morgan Stanley suggesting Walmart Plus could be worth $45 billion. The retail giant launched its membership program in 2020 in a bid to compete with Amazon Prime. Costs are similar. $12.95 per month. That includes free shipping, delivery, and savings on fuel, among other benefits.Members also have access to Paramount Plus streaming content, a new addition. Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman says, quote, ""we're not sure the stock is getting full credit for Walmart's progress in growing membership and for the recurring income stream it generates."" Walmart does not disclose the actual numbers of members.But Gutman estimates the figure could reach 18 and 1/2 million, or 14-plus percent of US households. And that represents the $45 billion figure we mentioned there. That adds $17 billion to the current stock price. Shares up about 3% today. Down, though, 8% year to date. Rachelle, this is a big note out on the future of Walmart Plus. We always talk about Amazon Prime, today being their second Prime Day, which is kind of not as well received as they might have hoped. A lot of upside here for Walmart.- I mean, you'd think so. Clearly, it's been working well for Amazon. And that's the model to go by, even though, obviously, Walmart was the more established brand. I do think this is a very smart play from Walmart. I do have to wonder, though, how thin consumers can actually be stretched. And will they be willing to have both their Amazon Prime accounts plus then having this with Walmart? Or will they perhaps pick and choose.And then when you add on bundling on top of that when it comes to them both sort of teaming up with streaming services, it's a lot. You might have to pick sides if you just don't have the bandwidth to be able to afford both Amazon and Walmart's prices right now, Seana.Story continues- Yeah. I think the bigger question also going forward is what this could potentially mean for Amazon Prime membership. We know that Amazon Prime membership has up until this point remained very sticky. If there is a competing offer out there from Walmart that continues to gain a popularity, obviously, this could be a huge challenge here for Amazon going forward.The one thing that does differentiate the two offerings here is, clearly, that fuel savings that, Dave, you mentioned there in terms of Walmart. So when we're seeing gas prices so high and now likely to creep back above $4 a gallon when we're looking at the nationwide average, I think that would be enough to entice some people to Walmart instead of what they're getting from Amazon Prime.- Yeah. You put enough miles on your car, it's pretty easy to make up 13 bucks in one month.]"

If you want to see some more of the valuable companies, go directly to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow indices have experienced a significant dip since the start of 2022, providing attractive investment opportunities to long-term investors. Jeremy Siegel, a renowned finance professor at Wharton Business School, believes that some of the best long-term stocks are trading at very cheap valuations in the market currently. He believes that the raging inflation, hovering around a four-decade high, can be expected to come under control as the housing market is cooling down. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government has increased the money supply by 40%, and historically, earnings have increased with an expansion in the money supply. Mr. Siegel observed that, at one point, numerous established stocks saw a surge of 50% to 55% compared to their levels before the pandemic. However, the recent weakness in the stock market has pulled back these gains to around 20% only, bringing down the valuation of companies.It is widely believed that the majority of the wealth created in the stock market is due to the success of the best long-term stocks, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A study conducted at the business school of Arizona State University concluded that over 55% of the stocks listed in the US and 57% of the stocks listed in other leading stock markets globally underperformed in comparison to the relative performance of risk-free US Treasury bonds during the three-decade period between 1990 and 2020. Meanwhile, over $75 trillion of the global wealth created in the stock markets was due to the strong performance of only 2.4% of the stocks listed on these exchanges.

(NYSE:JPM) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon. Inflationary expectations are only now working themselves into the labor market with historically low unemployment, resurgent labor unions, and higher wages. These labor cost pressures are only starting to show up in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent Producer Price Index showed a +9% year over year increase, the highest since it was created in 2010. Higher input prices generally lead to rising consumer prices.“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon.” Consumer balance sheets are in excellent shape with lower unemployment and banked stimulus checks. A recent analysis from JP Morgan Chase (JPM) showed average checking accounts have 50% higher balances than pre-Covid. The U.S. money supply as measured by M2 (a calculation that includes cash, checking accounts, and “near cash” such as money market securities) is up +38% versus year-end 2019. Higher consumer cash holdings and higher money supply mean more spending and demand for goods. Some emphasize supply issues to explain current inflation. Going forward, we see very strong demand as well, too much money chasing too few goods.”In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also some of the best long-term stocks trading at attractive valuations currently. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Most Valuable Internet Companies Today10 Monthly Dividend Stocks with High Yields15 Most Valuable Companies in HistoryDisclose.

(NYSE:WMT) Shares Could Be 39% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-shares-120059437.html,1665489659,STORY,['WMT'],"[How far off is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Walmart What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$16.0bUS$15.8bUS$16.6bUS$18.9bUS$20.1bUS$21.0bUS$21.8bUS$22.5bUS$23.1bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.48%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$15.2kUS$14.3kUS$14.2kUS$15.4kUS$15.5kUS$15.4kUS$15.2kUS$14.9kUS$14.5kUS$14.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$149bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$713bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$713b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$424bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$573b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$129, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walmart as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

While the stock has lost 19.9% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why EQR Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of EQR shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.01. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for EQRThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering EQR in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, EQR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The move is aligned with the Biden Administration’s goal of reaching three billion gallons of SAF production per year by 2030.Contingent upon the type of ethanol feedstock used, when jet fuel is produced from Honeywell's ethanol-to-jet fuel technology, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 80% on a total lifecycle basis compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. The technology uses high-performance catalysts and heat management capabilities to optimize production efficiency and yield cost-effective, lower-carbon-intensity aviation fuel.Barry Glickman, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions, said, ""Honeywell pioneered SAF production with its Ecofining technology, and our new ethanol-to-jet fuel process builds on that original innovation to support the global aviation sector's efforts to reduce GHG emissions and meet SAF production targets with an abundant feedstock like ethanol.""Honeywell International Inc. PriceHoneywell International Inc. PriceHoneywell International Inc. price | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteHoneywell's technology used in SAF plants can help in lowering installed costs and result in less labor-intensive installation compared to job site construction.Honeywell's ETJ technology can also benefit petroleum refiners and transportation fuel producers by enabling the conversion of current or idle facilities into SAF production plants. This would help cater to growing demand by maximizing the use of existing sites for SAF production.In 2021, the Biden Administration set a target for the aviation industry to reduce emissions by 20% by 2030. The US government has an ultimate goal of net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, i.e., conventional jet fuel will be replaced entirely with SAF. Apart from this, the European Council’s aim for a minimum of 2% SAF usage in airports by 2025 and at least 63% by 2050 highlights the need for SAF feedstocks to meet the demand.

A new paper from global water technology company Xylem (NYSE: XYL), Net Zero: The Race We All Win, shows how water managers are reducing their emissions and making infrastructure more resilient to climate change.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221011005083/en/Learn about some of the strategies that are helping utilities reduce emissions in Xylem's new paper. (Graphic: Business Wire)""We have an opportunity to help the water sector be the fastest to reduce its carbon emission footprint. Utilities, already on the frontlines of the effects of climate change and aging infrastructure, and passionate public servants, are the key,"" said Patrick Decker, President and CEO of Xylem. ""This paper and action show how leading water utility managers are delivering real progress toward net-zero goals. And these examples show how quickly and affordably they are doing it, while optimizing their overall operations. The technology exists to address these challenges, and the time to make a difference is now.""Water infrastructure accounts for approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – the same as the global shipping industry. Net Zero: The Race We All Win, which is available to download, highlights pragmatic approaches and proven technologies that can reduce water utility emissions to net zero. The methods used by pace-setting utilities include:Create a smart net zero strategy – realistic, measurable targets towards emissions-reduction goalsOptimize energy and resources across a network – cost-neutral strategies to reduce emissions while ensuring process stabilityEmbed net-zero goals in capital planning – net-zero criteria that fold into existing processes and the flow of day-to-day decision-makingMove from treatment to resource recovery – from wastewater as a by-product to be managed to a resourceStory continuesAmong the success stories highlighted in the paper is the City of South Bend, Indiana. The city used technology to reduce combined sewer overflow volume by more than 70 percent. This prevented needless construction of new grey infrastructure and eliminated the associated embedded carbon. The city improved system performance and capacity utilization, and delivered environmental gains 10 to 15 years ahead of schedule.""While the headline figure of our work was that the city has saved approximately $500 million in capital work savings, the impact on our carbon footprint should not be overlooked. By avoiding a large construction project and prolonging the life or our infrastructure through smart technology, we have made a major impact in reducing our carbon footprint,"" said Kieran Fahey, Director, Long-Term Control Plan at the Department of Public Works, City of South Bend.In another example, EWE WASSER GmbH (EWE) in Cuxhaven, one of Germany’s largest wastewater companies, reduced energy use by 30 percent in part of its operations. Its plant has the capacity to treat wastewater for 400,000 people, and the reductions saved 1.1 million kWh annually, enough energy to power 275 homes for one year, while ensuring high water quality.Xylem executives will be leading decarbonization conversations at WEFTEC 2022 and European Energy Efficiency Day this week, and at the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt next month.Xylem was named ""Net Zero Carbon Champion"" at the 2022 Global Water Awards. This award recognized the Company’s work to accelerate the decarbonization of the water sector and its pledge to partner with utilities, businesses, and water managers around the world to help reduce their carbon footprint. It also acknowledged the Company’s commitments in sustainability: in the last two years the Company has already reduced the CO2 footprint of its water customers by over 1 million metric tons.About XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis of the hotel industry, and go directly to the 5 Best Hotel Stocks To Buy Now.The hotel industry is a branch of the hospitality sector that focuses on offering lodging services to clients. According to Statista, the global market for hotels and resorts reached its peak in 2019 at $1.52 trillion. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused the market size to fall under $1 trillion in 2020 and 2021. The market was anticipated to be worth $1.06 trillion in 2022. According to Deloitte, there is an indication that some consumers are still adjusting to COVID while there has been a welcome uptick in activity across the industry. Consumers are also highly concerned about inflation and the cost of living, but these worries have not yet had a significant impact on their intentions to spend money on travel.According to CBRE, inbound tourism will increase hotel demand in 2022 in the U.S., driven primarily by leisure travelers from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2022, resorts and all-inclusive vacation spots will continue to do well as travelers look for simplicity and price stability. The advantages won't all be the same. Miami has benefited from the change in travel habits and is already doing 13% better than 2019's summer revenue per available room (RevPAR). Greater benefits may accrue in 2022 for harder-hit markets like San Francisco and New York, where RevPAR is still down 61% and 56%, respectively, from 2019. Given rising construction costs and manpower scarcity, supply growth will generally continue to be low.For the Hotel sector in the U.S., PWC foresees a more robust Q4. According to Warren Marr, US Hospitality &amp; Leisure Managing Director at PWC:“Despite volatility in the financial markets and heightened concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we now expect US hotels to surpass 2019 RevPAR levels this year, driven by strong growth in room rates stemming from focused revenue management strategies of operators.”Story continuesSmart money is certainly invested in the hospitality industry, and companies like Marriott International, Inc.

Thus far, the company has seen no material slowdown in occupancy levels or rates and continues to increase prices, especially on the leisure side. While leisure may be experiencing peak demand levels, management believes any slowdown in growth should be offset by the continued recovery of group and business customers.Volumes in these segments are rapidly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This should lead to higher margins as group and business travel spending is higher than leisure spending. The company’s anticipated strong free cash flow, coupled with cash proceeds from owned asset sales, can be used to repay debt incurred to complete its acquisition of Apple Leisure Group. Hyatt’s balance sheet is strong, and it has recently re-initiated its stock buyback program. Hyatt’s robust balance sheet and cash flow profile combined with additional asset sales should also result in more consistent earnings that could result in multiple expansion.”06.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: HP Inc. HPQ, Dell Technologies DELL, Apple AAPL and Lenovo LNVGY.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:PC Shipments Decline in Q3 on Lower Demand, Economic WoesThe decline seen in personal computer (PC) shipments in the first half of 2022, after two consecutive years of strong year-over-year growth, aggravated in the third quarter, according to the latest data compiled by market research firm, Gartner.Per the preliminary data released by Gartner, PC shipments in the September quarter plunged 19.5% year over year to 68 million units. The independent research firm claims the decline to be the sharpest since it has been tracking the PC market since the mid-1990s.Why Did PC Shipments Fall in Q3?Gartner opines that the year-over-year decline was mainly due to weakening consumer demand for PCs, supply-chain issues and high inventory levels. Softening IT spending amid the ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in a decline in demand for PCs.Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnIn 2020 and 2021, PC manufacturers had benefited from increased demand amid the pandemic-induced remote-working and online-learning wave. The pandemic necessitated the use of PC systems, be it for remote work, web-based learning, video conferencing, video gaming, social media, consumer entertainment and streaming or online shopping.However, the recent back-to-back three quarters of declining PC shipments depict an end of the demand boom for the industry. We believe that consumers have become more cautious about their spending due to inflationary pressure and fears of a possible recession.The drastic decline in PC shipments was also due to a steep downturn in Chromebook demand as the reopening of schools and colleges across the majority parts of the world weakened the necessity for education on PCs. Gartner noted that despite massive promotions and price drops, back-to-school sales were disappointing as many consumers had purchased new PCs in the last two years.Story continuesGartner in its report pointed out that though supply-chain challenges have eased somewhat, higher inventory level has become a major issue due to softened demand for consumer as well as commercial PCs.Additionally, Gartner pointed out that several PC manufacturers’ decision to halt business operations in Russia due to its attack on Ukraine severely affected PC shipment volumes in the quarter.Vendor-Wise PC ShipmentsGartner revealed that all vendors registered steep year-over-year declines in their PC sales volumes. Per the data compiled by Gartner, HP Inc. registered the highest fall of 27.9% to 12.71 million units, followed by Acer’s 25.6% to $4.49 million PCs.Dell Technologies’ PC volumes plunged 21.1% to 12.02 million units, while Apple registered a 15.6% year-over-year decline in shipments to 5.8 million units. Lenovo shipments contracted 15.3% to 17.11 million, while Asus witnessed a 7.5% decline to 5.56 million units.Per Gartner, Lenovo continues to hold the top spot in the vendor list, followed by HP and Dell, with a market share of 25.2%, 18.7% and 17.7%, respectively. Apple, ASUS and Acer ended the July-September quarter with a market share of 8.5%, 8.2% and 6.6%, respectively.Among the leading vendors, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Dell has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

But there will be – there will be consequences.""Biden already had a fraught relationship with Saudi Arabia.The two nations' long alliance has been increasingly fractious in recent years. Issues include Saudi human-rights abuses — particularly the killing of Jamal Khashoggi — US support for a nuclear deal with Iran, and Biden's initial hostility to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which was partially rowed back in a recent visit.An increase in oil prices benefits Russia at a time when the US and Western nations are trying to punish the country for its invasion of Ukraine.White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre responded to the news of the cuts last week by saying it was ""clear"" that OPEC+ was ""aligning with Russia"".US officials warned Saudi Arabia that it would be seen as taking Russia's side if OPEC+ cut its production, but Saudi Arabia dismissed the warnings and proceeded, The Wall Street Journal reported.Story continuesRussia on Sunday praised OPEC+ for cutting its oil production targets.Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday that the OPEC+ decision was taken only for economic reasons, Reuters reported.Biden's hardened stance on Saudi Arabia is a big shift from his repeated engagement with the Kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some Democratic lawmakers said the OPEC+ decision shows that the US needs to reconsider its relationship with Saudi Arabia, which receives extensive military assistance from the US.John Kirby, spokesman for Biden's national security council, said on Tuesday that Biden was willing to start re-evaluating that relationship immediately. Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The United States could soon overtake Russia as the main crude supplier to the EU and the UK combined - by August, U.S. imports lagged those from Russia by just 40,000 bpd compared with a 1.3 million bpd pre-war average, according to the IEA.Outside the EU, Russia's top crude oil export markets are China, India and Turkey.WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO RUSSIAN CRUDE? Under the looming ban, the EU will need to replace an additional 1.4 million barrels of Russian crude, with some 300,000 bpd potentially coming from the United States and 400,000 bpd from Kazakhstan, the IEA has said. Norway's largest oilfield Johan Sverdrup, which produces medium-heavy crude similar to Russia's Urals, also plans to ramp-up production in the fourth-quarter, potentially by 220,000 bpd. The IEA says imports from other areas such as the Middle East and Latin America would be needed to fully meet EU demand. Some Russian oil will continue to flow into the EU via pipelines as the ban excludes some landlocked refineries unless Russia decides to stop the flows.Story continuesHOW MUCH DOES THE EU DEPEND ON RUSSIAN CRUDE IMPORTS? Germany, the Netherlands and Poland were the top importers of Russian oil in Europe last year, but all three have capacity to bring in seaborne crude.Landlocked countries in Eastern Europe, such as Slovakia or Hungary, however, have few alternatives to pipeline supplies from Russia. The EU's dependence on Russia has also been underpinned by companies such as Rosneft and Lukoil, controlling some of the bloc's largest refineries. Russian crude oil flows, based on loading data in August, rose month-on-month to Italy and the Netherlands, where Russian oil major Lukoil owns refineries, according to the IEA. The German government on Sept. 16 took control of the Rosneft-owned Schwedt refinery which supplies about 90% of Berlin's fuel needs.For a FACTBOX on how German refineries seek to operate without Russian crude, seeAlso in September, the Italian government said it hoped Lukoil would find a buyer for its ISAB refinery in Sicily, which accounts for a fifth of the country's refining capacity.(Compiled by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)]"

It has pumped about 490,000 barrels a day to the two countries in recent months, according to Reuters.Russia has weaponized its energy exports in retaliation to western sanctions imposed after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine.It has slashed the capacity of key pipelines to Europe including Nord Stream and supported the OPEC+ cartel's refusals to boost oil production despite the US pushing the bloc to increase its output.Tumbling oil supply from Russia could push prices up to $150 a barrel, JPMorgan analysts warned last month.Europe has fretted that supply could fall further if Russia sabotages its energy infrastructure after leaks were detected in the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines.German authorities have accused Russia of sabotaging the pipeline system after Denmark and Sweden discovered damage had been caused by hundreds of pounds of TNT.Poland's top energy official, Mateusz Berger, told Reuters that initial assessments suggested that Druzhba had suffered ""accidental damage"" – but traders may still be fretting about Europe's energy supplies.Brent crude jumped as much as 1.2% to $94.96 after news of the leak broke Wednesday, while WTI crude climbed 1.4% to $89.77.

55,c5721ce0-6ee4-3455-987a-c152d7beef5f,MS,2022-10-12,"Trading, Higher Rates to Aid Morgan Stanley's (MS) Q3 Earnings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trading-higher-rates-aid-morgan-134701870.html,1665496021,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley’s MS third-quarter 2022 results, scheduled to be announced on Oct 14, are expected to reflect the benefits of robust trading performance. Like the last quarter, wherein market volatility and client activity were unexpectedly robust, the overall trading business in the to-be-reported quarter was a bright spot.After witnessing gradual normalization in the second half of 2021, trading activities have turned around since the beginning of this year. Certain developments, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the continued supply-chain disruptions, have led to uncertainty among investors.Also, fears of a severe economic slowdown amid the ultra-aggressive stance of the central banks across the globe to control inflation drove client activity and trading volumes in the third quarter.These factors resulted in heightened volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. Hence, Morgan Stanley is likely to have recorded an improvement in trading revenues this time.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.57 billion. The figure suggests a decline of 10.8% from the previous-year quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 5.5%. Our estimate for total trading income is $3.06 billion, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 7.1%.Other Factors at PlayNet Interest Income (NII): Lending activities continued at a decent pace in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans accelerated in July and August.The Federal Reserve continued with its hawkish monetary policy stance, raising interest rates by another 150 basis points in the quarter. The policy rate reached 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. This is likely to have had a favorable impact on Morgan Stanley’s net interest margin (NIM) and NII.However, the inversion of the yield curve in the September-end quarter is expected to have weighed on NIM to some extent.Our estimate for third-quarter NII is $2.22 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 7.5%.Investment Banking (IB) Income: After an extraordinary performance for almost two years, global deal-making shrank for the third consecutive quarter. Raging inflation, the equity markets rout and fears of a recession dealt a blow to business sentiments and plans for expansion via acquisitions. Thus, both deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the third quarter.While Morgan Stanley’s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is expected to have been muted in the quarter. The consensus estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $827 million, suggesting a decline of 35% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $827.2 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 35%.For similar reasons, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volumes witnessed a decline too. Hence, Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees are expected to have been hurt in the quarter under review.The consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $393 million, suggesting a fall of 30.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $481 million indicates a fall of 52.4%. Thus, the consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $874 million implies a year-over-year plunge of 44.6%.Our estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $392.8 million, while our estimate for equity underwriting fees is $480.9 million.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.40 billion indicates a decline of 53.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for IB income is $1.70 billion, indicating a decline of 40.3%.Expenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have been a major support in the July-September quarter. As the company continues to invest in franchise, overall costs are anticipated to have flared up.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time around are high.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$225 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Microsoft What's The Opportunity In Microsoft?Good news, investors! Microsoft is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $324.03, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that Microsoft’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Microsoft generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 40%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MSFT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MSFT for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MSFT. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Our colleagues on the shop floor have access to production and management-related real-time data. They are able to work with drill-down dashboards and make data-based decisions,"" said Jan Brecht, Chief Information Officer, Mercedes-Benz Group AG.Redefine production excellence with a unified data platformWith the MO360 Data Platform, the Stuttgart-based carmaker can create a virtual replica of its vehicle manufacturing process, combining insights from assembly, production planning, shop floor logistics, supply chain and quality management. The virtual simulation and optimization of processes before running them on the shop floor helps accelerate operational efficiency and unlock energy savings. For example, managers can optimize operational patterns to reduce CO2 emissions in production.Mercedes-Benz is also exploring the integration of the MO360 Data Platform with data sources from other departments to enable a digital feedback loop that will spur continuous learning and innovation across the Group.The recently opened Mercedes-Benz Digital Factory Campus Berlin is the home base for the MO360 Data Platform engineering teams and will become the MO360 training and qualification center for implementing digital approaches globally.Increase supply chain resilience and efficiency With the new centralized data platform, teams can instantly analyze and visualize production data, to faster optimize production processes and identify potential supply chain bottlenecks. This enables a dynamic allocation of operational resources within and across plants to prioritize the manufacturing of low-emission and Top-End Luxury vehicles.The Mercedes-Benz Operations Logistics team will be able to solve supply chain bottlenecks much faster. They can compare the availability of components, including semiconductors, with production orders and position this data against production parameters including operational running plans. As a result, plant managers can keep the production running and prioritize relevant vehicles even if supply chain challenges occur.Move at full speed toward an all-electric futureThe MO360 Data Platform will make it easier to maintain production of both electric and combustion-engine vehicles on a single production line as the market demand gradually shifts toward an all-electric future.To tackle shortages in components and prevent delivery delays, the MO360 Data Platform will enable teams to explore a variety of production scenarios depending on the availability of components like semiconductors, based on real-time data about the quality of parts and equipment. This is expected to result in productivity gains of 20% in passenger car production by 2025 and help avoid unplanned downtimes and schedule maintenance work in a timely and CO2-friendly fashion.Reduce ecological footprint from water and energy use to waste managementAs part of the MO360 Data Platform, Mercedes-Benz has implemented an analytics tool to monitor and reduce its ecological footprint during vehicle production, a crucial milestone toward the company's Ambition 2039 initiative to become carbon neutral by 2039. With the data analytics tool, teams can track and forecast carbon emissions, energy and water usage as well as waste management and roll out best practices across the production network. Mercedes-Benz plans to cover more than 70% of its energy needs through renewable sources by 2030 by expanding solar and wind power at its own sites and through Power Purchase Agreements and plans to cut its use of water by 35%1 through the reuse of water in production.Democratize data to enhance workforce productivity and distributed teamworkMercedes-Benz production staff gets access to the MO360 Data Platform via a self-service portal available on any company device including tablets, smartphones and laptops. Its visualization with Microsoft Power BI provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience, allowing employees to become data workers with the ability to model and correlate data. The Teams Walkie Talkie app provides workers with an instant push-to-talk (PTT) communication on their business phones — no extra device needed. With the MO360 Data Platform, teams at Factory 56 have shortened their daily shop floor meeting by 30%. In addition, they identify priority tasks to optimize production workflows within two minutes, which took up to four hours prior to the introduction of the platform. From team leads and process engineers to shop and plant managers, employees are encouraged to contribute new use cases to drive process innovation with Microsoft Power Platform.Working with a global community of internal and external developers, Mercedes-Benz' process software engineers are committed to open collaboration. They use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) including GitHub to improve the quality of the software and the speed of delivery. They benefit from Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks and Azure Purview to process and govern huge amounts of data and run AI and analytics using their preferred development frameworks. For software deployment and operations, they work with Azure DevOps.About MicrosoftMicrosoft (Nasdaq ""MSFT"" @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Signet Jewelers, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$780m ÷ (US$6.2b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Therefore, Signet Jewelers has an ROCE of 18%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 18%. View our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Signet Jewelers compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Signet Jewelers.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsSignet Jewelers is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 21% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo sum it up, Signet Jewelers is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Considering the stock has delivered 12% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Signet Jewelers does have some risks, we noticed   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.While Signet Jewelers isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

USFD, Signet Jewelers SIG, Centene Corp. CNC, Grief GEF and HF Sinclair Corp. DINO.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in OctoberIt is not easy to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than they're worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.Though price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospectsThe P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per share.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. US Foods Holding Corp., Signet Jewelers, Centene Corp., Grief and HF Sinclair Corp. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:US Foods Holding is a foodservice distributor.

This year the survey suggested American teens are eager to get back to dining out following the COVID-19 pandemic.""Restaurant spending has grown to account for an increasing portion of the broader teen wallet over time, passing positive territory in Spring 2014,"" the survey noted, ""Despite a flattening out during COVID, we believe teens’ preference for restaurant and dining out occasions is positioned to rebound as behavioral spending patterns normalize.""Among average income teens, who come from households with total income of $66,497, Chick-Fil-A took the No. 1 spot with 14% share, followed by Starbucks at 12%, old favorite McDonald's, 7%, Chipotle, 5%, and Olive Garden coming in at No. 5 with 4%.Chick-fil-A is #1!CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MAY 06: A worker takes orders as customers line up in the drive-thru lane at a Chick-fil-A restaurant on May 06, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. Chicken prices have risen sharply this year as suppliers struggle to keep up with demand, fueled in part, by the popularity of new chicken offerings from fast-food restaurants. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)One reason for its top ranking: Chick-fil-A was able to maintain relatively steady foot traffic compared to pre-pandemic visit numbers, according to data intelligence platform Placer.ai, thanks to its ""significant"" store expansion. The Georgia-based chain Chick-fil-A recently opened its location in Hawaii, topping more than 2,700 restaurants in 47 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Canada.Chick-fil-A, not only popular among teens but ultra-popular among consumers overall. (It must be, given the long waits folks have to endure. According to a new study from Intouch Insight and QSR, locations are expected to have an average of 4.74 cars in line, making it the slowest drive-thru in America with an average total time spent of more than 8 minutes.)Back in Spring of 2022, Chick-fil-A also held the top spot among average income teens with 14% share followed by Starbucks at 11%, McDonald's, 7%, Chipotle, 5%, and Olive Garden, 3%.Story continuesAnother chain, Chipotle, maintained its No. 4 spot with teens with 5% market share.Piper Sandler considers it the ""most preferred at Hispanic cuisine levels across both upper-income and average-income teens""— a big opportunity for market share gains overall said Piper Sandler Managing Director Nicole Miller Regan.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 10: People walk past a Chipotle store on August 10, 2022 in New York City. NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced on Tuesday that Chipotle Mexican Grill announced that they will be paying $20 million dollars to current and former workers in their NYC restaurants for violating city labor laws. The settlement will cover about 13,000 employees who worked at the chain's NYC stores between 2017 and this year. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Starbucks, meanwhile, rose in the rankings to the No. 2 spot, holding 12% share—up from 11% this past spring and 10% share last fall. Why? Cold drinks. On a call with analysts, Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz called cold beverages a ""Gen Z product"" for the brand, while customization options lend a ""competitive advantage in our ability to customize almost any beverage that our customers want with speed.""Cold beverages accounted for 75% of beverage sales in the company's fiscal third quarter earnings report. Other public coffee companies like Dutch Bros (BROS), which announced plans to ramp up store openings this year, and Black Rifle Coffee Company (BRCC), did not rank among the teens surveyed.McDonald's (MCD) held its prime spot in the top five at No. 4.Among average-income teens specifically, it ranks No. 3 with 7%, higher than last fall where it held 5% of share. ""Looking forward, we believe the brand's ongoing efforts to drive heightened levels of digital engagement could help to drive incremental traction with teens,"" Regan added.In the company's most recent quarterly report, digital sales exceeded $6 billion dollars representing one-third of total systemwide sales. This comes after the launched its app-driven MyMcDonald’s Rewards program in 2021. Once customers download the app and join, freebies including free Hash Browns, Vanilla Cone, McChicken or Cheeseburger can be ""unlocked"" after the first order.That's one way to keep teens happy — and brands strong.MIAMI, FLORIDA - JULY 26: Customers wait to order food at a McDonalds fast food restaurant on July 26, 2022 in Miami, Florida. The McDonald's company reported U.S. same-store sales rose 3.7%, while international sales rose 9.7% during the most recent quarter. However, it also said that total revenue fell 3% to $5.72 billion; it attributed the weakness to slowing demand in China.

The company reported top and bottom line beat for the last seven quarters. ADM continues to benefit from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment also bodes well.The company’s Nutrition segment has been gaining from significant growth in the Human and Animal Nutrition units. The Human Nutrition unit continues to reflect gains from strength across its diverse product portfolio. Continued top-line growth in Flavors, particularly in North America, EMEA and South America, bodes well despite rising costs.Strength in alternative proteins led to strong soy protein volumes and margins. This, along with gains from the Sojaprotein buyout and healthy demand for texturants, aided the Specialty Ingredients category. The Health &amp; Wellness unit witnessed robust quarterly improvement, driven by growth in probiotics, gains from its Deerland Probiotics buyout and solid fiber demand.The animal nutrition unit has been gaining from robust volumes and margins in amino acids. Backed by strength across the Human and Animal Nutrition units, the company expects 20% operating profit growth for the nutrition segment in 2022. The company expects operating profit growth for third-quarter 2022 to be higher year over year in the third quarter, driven by the continued demand and favorable ethanol blending economics.Archer Daniels is progressing well with its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth. Under the optimize pillar, the company is on track with improvement in its key businesses — the Decatur complex, Golden Peanut and Three Nuts business. Archer Daniels is restructuring its North American wheat milling footprint by shutting old, less efficient mills and opening a state-of-the-art facility in Mendota.As part of ADM’s optimizing pillar, it continues to adapt to consumers’ changing nutritional preferences. Under its drive pillar, the company continues to modify its organizational structure to meet operational excellence and set goals. Further, under the growth pillar, the company is looking to expand its footprint in fast-growing alternative protein.Backed by the positives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 36.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 24.1% growth.

Higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations have been hurting SG&amp;A expenses.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$373.0mUS$462.0mUS$515.0mUS$530.0mUS$542.9mUS$555.3mUS$567.4mUS$579.4mUS$591.3mUS$603.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.28%Est @ 2.18%Est @ 2.11%Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$347US$399US$413US$395US$376US$358US$340US$322US$306US$290(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.5bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$603m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.6%– 1.9%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$5.2bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.8b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$34.7, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Leggett &amp; Platt as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.337. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

It has been cutting production in Rod and Wire businesses to reduce inventory, given the bedding demand environment and slowing market for steel.Key TakeawaysPandemic-related supply issues and channel-specific pressures have adversely impacted demand significantly for the Specialty Foam business. LEG has been witnessing lower demand for Specialty Foam, which along with operational inefficiencies, is creating hurdles.Meanwhile, owing to geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions in Europe, International Bedding has been experiencing lower demand. The home Furniture demand has softened significantly over the last few months, with slower consumer demand and excess inventory at retail.The volume and cost recovery in Automotive has been improving in a slower-than-expected trend as supply chain and geopolitical impacts bring continued volatility.Overall, owning to the above-mentioned headwinds, LEG now expects sales in the range of $5.1–$5.2 billion versus $5.2-$5.4 billion expected earlier. Earnings are now expected to be between $2.30 and 2.45 per share, down from a prior expectation of $2.65-$2.80. The company now expects an EBIT margin of 9.5-10% (versus the prior expectation of 10.5-10.7%). Cash from operations is expected to be between $400 and $450 million (versus the prior guidance of $550–$600 million).AcquisitionsThe company has been navigating these challenges by aligning costs, production levels, and inventory with demand. It has been evaluating near-term opportunities with customers, focusing on new product developments and expanding its existing businesses through acquisitions.Leggett &amp; Platt acquired a leading global manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders for heavy construction machinery in late August 2022. The acquired unit has manufacturing facilities in Eschwege, Germany and Ningbo, China and a distribution facility in Halifax, PA, with combined 2021 sales of approximately $65 million. Also, LEG acquired a converter of construction fabrics for the furniture and bedding industries in Shannon, MS, during the same month.

Anmuth also expects those numbers to swell to 22 million subscribers and $2.65 billion in advertising sales by 2026 as Netflix's execution on selling ads improves.But for other pros, this rosy outlook is overdone.That's the tone from two bearish notes from Pivotal Research and Goldman Sachs out on Tuesday. These notes, along with broader market volatility, sent Netflix shares down nearly 7% in Tuesday's trading.Here's what those analysts had to say about Netflix:Goldman Sachs Analyst Eric SheridanRating: SellPrice Target: $182Downside Projected: -20.8%""Since its last earnings report, Netflix has outperformed the market... on the back of a mix of 'better than feared' subscriber losses in Q2 and growing investor optimism about the company’s dual initiatives — building toward a product launch for an ad supported subscriber tier and beginning to implement a crackdown on password sharing in some overseas markets,"" Sheridan wrote. ""On the former, as we have had a number of conversations with advertising industry checks, we stand by our analysis of the opportunity set for Netflix that we first introduced in our last quarterly earnings preview as we expect a host of large scaled brand advertisers will adopt the offering but its current framework (large minimum commitment, above industry pricing and limited measurement) could cap the advertising dollar opportunity unless it evolves.""Story continuesIn addition, Sheridan warned that ""additional subscriber offerings could cause 'spin down' into the lowest priced plans by users in any potential consumer recession over the next 6-12 months.""A man participates in a Netflix series 'Squid Game' mission at a department store in Bangkok, Thailand, November 20, 2021. REUTERS/Chalinee ThirasupaPivotal Research Analyst Jeff WlodarczakRating: SellPrice Target: $175Downside Projected: -23.9%""In the end, this is not rocket science,"" Wlodarczak wrote. ""We view Netflix's move to launch an ad supported alternative as fraught with ARPU [average revenue per user], technological, financial and product risk. If Netflix were an upstart player looking to add subscribers, ad supported could be a no brainer but as the incumbent operator it seems to offer more risk than reward mainly given the existing sub repricing/results variability risk. We don’t see significant subscriber acceleration in the key U.S. market from the move, beyond a potential short-term benefit, and in most international markets the ad opportunity per sub is dramatically less than in the U.S.""As a result, he continued, ""we view the potential transition of ultimately 40-60% of Netflix subscriber base to ad supported as a very risky endeavor which combined with increasing levels of competition (exacerbated by the fact certain players are not focused on profitability in the core streaming business) and the existing still rich valuation leads us to continue to be cautious on the stock.""The analyst noted one other headwind Netflix faces as streaming companies battle over subscribers.""A last under-appreciated risk here is that Netflix management believes they can moderate the growth in content costs when virtually all of their peers are accelerating investment in content particularly on exclusive sports rights which could ultimately hit Netflix subscriber growth or push the company to reaccelerate content investment spend,"" Wlodarczak said.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

That means the limited series is now Netflix’s second most popular English-language series of all time in its initial release, with 701.37 million hours watched, behind only “Stranger Things 4,” which was watched 1.35 billion hours in its first 28 days. “Dahmer” has now garnered more watch-time than seasons 1 and 2 of Shonda Rhimes’ “Bridgerton” in their first four weeks on the service.The all-time Netflix TV leader in the first four weeks of release remains “Squid Game,” the South Korean surprise hit that notched 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first 28 days on the service.The 10-epsiode “Monster,” which premiered Sept. 21, follows the story of the real-life Milwaukee serial killer, who murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991, primarily told from the perspective of Dahmer’s victims. The series also explores “the systemic racism and institutional failures” of the Wisconsin police that “allowed one of America’s most notorious serial killers to continue his murderous spree in plain sight for over a decade,” according to Netflix’s description of the show.“Monster” has been popular among Netflix members — but reviewers have panned the show, which currently has a 52% critics’ score on Rotten Tomato. Variety TV critic Caroline Framke called the limited series “predictable,” adding, “It’s a grim, sepia-toned slog that rarely justifies its own existence.”On the Netflix film side, the Ryan Murphy-produced horror movie “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” debuted at No. 2 on the Top 10 English Films list with 35.42 million hours viewed after its Oct. 5 premiere, according to the streamer. Topping the chart for the week was “Luckiest Girl Alive,” starring Mila Kunis and based on bestseller of the same name by Jessica Knoll, which notched 43.08 million hours viewed (and was in the Top 10 in 91 countries). “Blonde,” starring Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe, pulled in 17.41 million hours viewed for the week of Oct. 3-9 (for a total of 54.75 million hours over the two weeks since its Sept. 28 premiere).Story continuesMeanwhile, Netflix subscribers showed strong interest in the “Conversations With a Killer” documentary series, with “The Jeffrey Dahmer Tapes” (31.4 million hours viewed) and “The John Wayne Gacy Tapes” (8.86 million hours viewed) both reaching the Top 10 for the week on the English TV chart. “The Midnight Club” (18.79 million hours viewed), Mike Flanagan’s latest horror series that recently broke the Guinness World Record for most jump scares in a premiere episode, also reached the Top 10.Among non-English TV series, “The Empress,” a German historical drama about the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, stayed No. 1 with 59.43 million hours viewed. Polish drama “High Water” debuted on the Top 10 list in the No. 2 spot with 45.84 million hours viewed. Netflix’s popular Korean shows continued to draw viewers: Remaining on the non-English TV Top 10 for the week of Oct. 3-9 were “Little Women” (23.58 million hours), “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” (12.22 million hours), “Alchemy of Souls” (9.78 million hours), “Young Lady and Gentleman” (8.52 million hours) and “Narco-Saints” (7.58 million hours).VIP+ Analysis: Is Murphy Worth His Monster Netflix Deal?Best of VarietyThe Best Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2022: From 'House of the Dragon' to 'Euphoria'Constance Wu Gets Candid in Revealing New Memoir 'Making a Scene'What's Coming to Netflix in October 2022]"

Netflix at The Grove will remain open to the public through Jan. 6, 2023.The new store will feature limited-edition merchandise, according to Netflix.

Titles to be featured include Guillermo del Toro’s “Pinocchio,” “Slumberland,” “Enola Holmes” starring Millie Bobby Brown, “The School for Good and Evil,” “Matilda” and “Emily in Paris,” as well as Netflix’s slate of 2022 holiday originals including “Falling for Christmas,” “Christmas With You,” “The Noel Diary” and “The Great British Baking Show: Holidays.”Story continuesNetflix previously opened pop-up stores for “Stranger Things” and “Bridgerton.” In addition, the company has produced live immersive experiences for several originals including “Stranger Things,” “Bridgerton,” “Money Heist” and “Army of the Dead.”The storefront at The Grove “felt like the most organic next step to continue our growth and bring Netflix’s most beloved shows together in a completely new way,” Greg Lombardo, Netflix’s head of live experiences, said in a statement. “Celebrating our fans and giving them the opportunity to put themselves in the world of the stories they love is at the heart of what we do, and we’re thrilled to bring this experience to life at The Grove.”Netflix shared additional photos of the pop-store, including an artist’s rendering of the exterior:Best of VarietyThe Best Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2022: From 'House of the Dragon' to 'Euphoria'Constance Wu Gets Candid in Revealing New Memoir 'Making a Scene'What's Coming to Netflix in October 2022]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Cumulus Media and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMLS likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NFLX has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CMLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.08, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 22.97. We also note that CMLS has a PEG ratio of 0.27. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.18.Another notable valuation metric for CMLS is its P/B ratio of 0.33.

120,34194d0a-2bd8-35f6-b83a-fecba5859979,PSX,2022-10-12,Returns On Capital Are Showing Encouraging Signs At Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-showing-encouraging-signs-180256193.html,1665511376,STORY,['PSX'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Phillips 66, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$63b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Phillips 66 has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Oil and Gas industry average it falls behind. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Phillips 66 compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEPhillips 66 is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 467% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 28% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Phillips 66's ROCEAs discussed above, Phillips 66 appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Considering the stock has delivered 23% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you want to know some of the risks facing Phillips 66 we've found 3 warning signs (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.While Phillips 66 may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

121,f19dda92-0f2d-3290-b800-a97b3d864ad3,PSX,2022-10-12,Should Value Investors Buy Delek US Holdings (DK) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-delek-us-134001667.html,1665495601,STORY,"['DLEKG.TA', 'DK', 'PSX']","[While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Delek US Holdings (DK). DK is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.Investors should also note that DK holds a PEG ratio of 0.38. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. DK's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.66. Over the last 12 months, DK's PEG has been as high as 0.48 and as low as 0.22, with a median of 0.30.Another notable valuation metric for DK is its P/B ratio of 1.59. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.90. Over the past year, DK's P/B has been as high as 3.12 and as low as 1.11, with a median of 1.44.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. DK has a P/S ratio of 0.13. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that DK has a P/CF ratio of 3.85. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. DK's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.67. Within the past 12 months, DK's P/CF has been as high as 126.69 and as low as 2.81, with a median of 17.41.Another great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Phillips 66 (PSX), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of Phillips 66 currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 7.42, and its PEG ratio is 0.60. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 5.21 and 0.66.PSX's Forward P/E has been as high as 19.08 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 10.43. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.40, as low as 0.48, with a median of 0.65.Phillips 66 also has a P/B ratio of 1.81 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 1.90. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.45, with a median of 1.72.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Delek US Holdings and Phillips 66 strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, DK and PSX look like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

122,41fc8d54-2692-37e5-984a-d8fb37d4f468,PSX,2022-10-12,Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001623.html,1665493201,STORY,['PSX'],"[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Phillips 66 (PSX) earns a Zacks Rank #2 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 1, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.09 a share.PSX has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.13%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.04.PSX is part of a big group of Oils-Energy stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Patterson-UTI (PTEN) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2022, Patterson-UTI holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.22 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Patterson-UTI is $0.19, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 18.28%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, PSX and PTEN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Mining Stocks To Buy Now.Mining Industry Analysis: Projections and RisksThe mining sector has been a traditional hedge against inflation. Commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster amid geopolitical unrest, rising inflation, and high interest rates. According to an industry analysis report by Research and Markets, the global mining industry was valued at $1.8 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach a value of $2 trillion in 2022. Moving forward, the global mining industry is poised to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% through 2026 and reach a valuation of $3.35 trillion. While these numbers look promising, the mining industry is faced with a multitude of challenges. According to KPMG's 2022 Mining Outlook, some of the top priority risks that the mining industry is being faced with in 2022 include ESG regulations, political instability, supply chain issues, and a global trade conflict among others. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its escalation is impacting the global commodities market and the London Metal Exchange is considering placing sanctions on Russian metals. Russia is a major producer and exporter of aluminum, copper, steel, and nickel.A Potential Mining SupercycleWhile the near-term outlook for the mining sector is somewhat cloudy and bleak, some analysts see the mining industry heading into a supercycle over the next couple of years. TD Securities Managing Director and Head of Mining Equity Research, Greg Barnes, appeared in an interview on MoneyTalk where he shared his insights and outlook for the mining sector. Greg Barnes thinks that though a slowing global economy, high inflation, high interest rates, and a strong dollar are putting pressure on commodity prices, the long-term supply and demand trends for metals favor the probability of a mining supercycle. Greg Barnes said that mining projects are ""difficult to build and very expensive"" and that in the near term he expects headwinds for the sector and supply constraints. However, in the long term, he thinks ""the stage is being set"" for a ""potential super cycle"" primarily driven by an increase in demand for battery metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium.Story continuesThe mining sector has been taking a beating in 2022, and some of the best-in-class miners are beaten down to bargain levels.

The honor recognizes visionary leaders who enhance customers' lives through dedication to their industry and communities.""Having started my career in natural gas and having served as an AGA president, I couldn't be more honored to receive this award,"" LaRossa remarked. ""This is a critical time for the future of gas and the entire energy industry, as we fully embrace clean energy and implement solutions to fight climate change. Americans rely on natural gas because it has proven to be safe and affordable. Looking ahead, we have great opportunity to continue to decarbonize as we introduce innovations such as hydrogen.""In accepting the award, LaRossa continued, ""embracing change means supporting the workforce of today as the energy landscape and the jobs needed evolve around us while continuing to diversify the workforce to better represent our population and the skills needed for the future. All this while companies aim to reduce carbon in every available way and help customers who are struggling to pay their bills - particularly during winter heating season. It is up to all of us how we respond to climate change and the needs of society as we transition into the future, we can and must ensure it is a just transition.""In recognizing LaRossa, the AGA acknowledged that he ""has been a passionate advocate for energy customers - meeting their needs while improving safety, reliability and emergency response performance."" LaRossa began his career in 1985 at PSE&amp;G as an associate engineer. AGA said, ""His long career at the company and his rise to the C-suite is a testament to his leadership within the company and his dedication to the industry.""In 2016, LaRossa was the Chair of the AGA board and led the industry effort to reauthorize the Pipeline Safety Act.LaRossa championed workforce and skills development and inspired others in the gas industry to better prepare employees to deliver energy to the customers of tomorrow.Story continuesUnder his leadership, AGA created or participated in programs to help assure that utility workforces better reflect the communities they serve, including Veterans in Energy and the Next Level Leadership Women's Program.LaRossa's passion for bringing a new generation of diverse workers into AGA member companies spurred action throughout the industry and benefitted thousands of young people.

136,66836f42-a3d2-3504-8472-df20d5ed4ece,M,2022-10-12,The Trend Of High Returns At Macy's (NYSE:M) Has Us Very Interested,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trend-high-returns-macys-nyse-100917292.html,1665482957,STORY,['M'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Macy's' (NYSE:M) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Macy's:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Macy's has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Macy's roceIn the above chart we have measured Macy's' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Macy's Tell Us?Macy's' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 96% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom LineAs discussed above, Macy's appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has only returned 7.1% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.One final note, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Macy's (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) .If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

137,85f3ee73-c843-3a81-be36-04fca7c2855f,GD,2022-10-12,General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 87% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-gd-110012255.html,1665572412,STORY,['GD'],"[Does the October share price for General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.33bUS$4.46bUS$4.78bUS$4.99bUS$5.18bUS$5.35bUS$5.50bUS$5.65bUS$5.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.77%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.86%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% US$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.0%– 2.0%) = US$145bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$145b÷ ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$81bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$117b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$228, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.868. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

A decline in economic activity tends to drive crude prices lower as demand and consumer spending falls.Oil benchmarks surged to around $130 a barrel in February after Russia invaded Ukraine, but they've since slipped back towards $90. Inflation has remained high in recent months, spurring the Fed to continue its tightening campaign in a bid to tame soaring prices.""Oil market fundamentals have taken a back seat to the broader macro landscape and the policy driven market,"" Tran's team said.The previous quarter ""was a stark reminder that a violently strong and erratic macro headwind can temporarily trump individual fundamentals across most asset classes, and vice versa for tailwinds,"" they added.Story continuesFalling oil prices could also provide relief for Americans at the pump. National average gas prices have slipped from $5 a gallon in June to $3.92 a gallon Wednesday, according to AAA.RBC laid out two other economic scenarios that could impact oil prices next year.In a ""blue sky risk on scenario,"" Brent will surge by around 25% to between $115 and $120 a barrel as Russia continues to slash crude supply to Europe through key pipelines.""Russia loses material physical volumes of output and supply tightness underpins the fundamental framework, overshadowing recessionary fears,"" they said.In a scenario where the US suffers a shallow rather than a deep recession, RBC expects crude to hover around its current level of between $90 and $95 a barrel.""Russia loses barrels later this year, global supply tightens, but concerns centering on oil demand given the weakening global economic backdrop makes fresh risk deployment a high hurdle,"" the strategists said.Read more: Crude oil could hit $125 a barrel as Russia's reaction to a US-led price cap threatens to squeeze supply, UBS saysRead the original article on Business Insider]"

The United States could soon overtake Russia as the main crude supplier to the EU and the UK combined - by August, U.S. imports lagged those from Russia by just 40,000 bpd compared with a 1.3 million bpd pre-war average, according to the IEA.Outside the EU, Russia's top crude oil export markets are China, India and Turkey.WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO RUSSIAN CRUDE? Under the looming ban, the EU will need to replace an additional 1.4 million barrels of Russian crude, with some 300,000 bpd potentially coming from the United States and 400,000 bpd from Kazakhstan, the IEA has said. Norway's largest oilfield Johan Sverdrup, which produces medium-heavy crude similar to Russia's Urals, also plans to ramp-up production in the fourth-quarter, potentially by 220,000 bpd. The IEA says imports from other areas such as the Middle East and Latin America would be needed to fully meet EU demand. Some Russian oil will continue to flow into the EU via pipelines as the ban excludes some landlocked refineries unless Russia decides to stop the flows.Story continuesHOW MUCH DOES THE EU DEPEND ON RUSSIAN CRUDE IMPORTS? Germany, the Netherlands and Poland were the top importers of Russian oil in Europe last year, but all three have capacity to bring in seaborne crude.Landlocked countries in Eastern Europe, such as Slovakia or Hungary, however, have few alternatives to pipeline supplies from Russia. The EU's dependence on Russia has also been underpinned by companies such as Rosneft and Lukoil, controlling some of the bloc's largest refineries. Russian crude oil flows, based on loading data in August, rose month-on-month to Italy and the Netherlands, where Russian oil major Lukoil owns refineries, according to the IEA. The German government on Sept. 16 took control of the Rosneft-owned Schwedt refinery which supplies about 90% of Berlin's fuel needs.For a FACTBOX on how German refineries seek to operate without Russian crude, seeAlso in September, the Italian government said it hoped Lukoil would find a buyer for its ISAB refinery in Sicily, which accounts for a fifth of the country's refining capacity.(Compiled by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)]"

But agreement on a gas price cap proved elusive.""We will see over the weekend how we can proceed with capping the gas for power generation - if this is at that stage that we can say that there is a broad majority of member states supporting this measure,"" Simson said.Most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, have been opposed, arguing it risks choking off supplies.In neighbouring Poland, pipeline operator PERN said a leak was detected on Tuesday evening in a section of the Druzhba oil pipe around 70 kms (43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.The Druzhba pipeline, whose name means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe.""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger told Reuters by telephone.Germany's PCK Refinery in the eastern town of Schwedt, which supplies 90% of Berlin's fuel, said it was still receiving oil deliveries from the Druzhba pipeline but at reduced capacity.SUPPORT MEASURESThe energy crisis has had knock-on effects across the whole of Europe as businesses have passed on extra costs, squeezing household budgets.Governments are also trying to figure out how to fund emergency measures taken to protect customers and smooth out the distortions caused by the surge in prices.EU member Portugal plans to inject 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) into its electricity and natural gas systems to curb prices paid by companies next year, the government said.In Britain, the new government set out plans for a temporary revenue limit on low-carbon electricity generators, which the industry said was a ""de-facto windfall tax"" on renewable energy producers.(Additional reporting by Kate Abnett and Marine Strauss in Brussels, Alan Charlish in Warsaw, Susanna Twidale, Muvija M and Nina Chestney in London and Jason Hovet in Prague Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

You can skip our comprehensive analysis of the hotel industry, and go directly to the 5 Best Hotel Stocks To Buy Now.The hotel industry is a branch of the hospitality sector that focuses on offering lodging services to clients. According to Statista, the global market for hotels and resorts reached its peak in 2019 at $1.52 trillion. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused the market size to fall under $1 trillion in 2020 and 2021. The market was anticipated to be worth $1.06 trillion in 2022. According to Deloitte, there is an indication that some consumers are still adjusting to COVID while there has been a welcome uptick in activity across the industry. Consumers are also highly concerned about inflation and the cost of living, but these worries have not yet had a significant impact on their intentions to spend money on travel.According to CBRE, inbound tourism will increase hotel demand in 2022 in the U.S., driven primarily by leisure travelers from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2022, resorts and all-inclusive vacation spots will continue to do well as travelers look for simplicity and price stability. The advantages won't all be the same. Miami has benefited from the change in travel habits and is already doing 13% better than 2019's summer revenue per available room (RevPAR). Greater benefits may accrue in 2022 for harder-hit markets like San Francisco and New York, where RevPAR is still down 61% and 56%, respectively, from 2019. Given rising construction costs and manpower scarcity, supply growth will generally continue to be low.For the Hotel sector in the U.S., PWC foresees a more robust Q4. According to Warren Marr, US Hospitality &amp; Leisure Managing Director at PWC:“Despite volatility in the financial markets and heightened concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we now expect US hotels to surpass 2019 RevPAR levels this year, driven by strong growth in room rates stemming from focused revenue management strategies of operators.”Story continuesSmart money is certainly invested in the hospitality industry, and companies like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) are some of the best hotel stocks that are very popular among hedge funds.12 Best Hotel Stocks To Buy NowZvonimir Atletic/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyLet’s dive into the 12 best hotel stocks to buy now.

Thus far, the company has seen no material slowdown in occupancy levels or rates and continues to increase prices, especially on the leisure side. While leisure may be experiencing peak demand levels, management believes any slowdown in growth should be offset by the continued recovery of group and business customers.Volumes in these segments are rapidly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This should lead to higher margins as group and business travel spending is higher than leisure spending. The company’s anticipated strong free cash flow, coupled with cash proceeds from owned asset sales, can be used to repay debt incurred to complete its acquisition of Apple Leisure Group. Hyatt’s balance sheet is strong, and it has recently re-initiated its stock buyback program. Hyatt’s robust balance sheet and cash flow profile combined with additional asset sales should also result in more consistent earnings that could result in multiple expansion.”06.

During those early days, most people didn't understand the concept of trading nonphysical items. Now markets for environmental attributes like renewable energy credits (RECs) and carbon offsets are part of a global effort to reduce emissions.As Vice President of Sustainable Solutions and Innovation, my team and I are part of the sustainability conversations driving business action. Find out more about today's energy landscape and how we support our customers' sustainability journeys.Sustainability means collaboration to achieve corporate goalsSustainability from a corporate perspective is the ability to endure. It's not just the ‘what,' it's the ‘how.'We identify our customers' priorities and what the energy purchase means from a sustainability perspective. Sometimes that conversation is with an energy buyer who's not the same as the sustainability professional in the organization. As a company with our own set of goals, we have firsthand experience bringing stakeholders together to achieve theirs.Emerging requirements increase demand for sustainable solutionsYou may have heard that the SEC is talking about new disclosure rules for public companies around their risks from a sustainability perspective. When that was first announced, there was a groundswell of interest from public companies trying to determine what that means for them and what they need to do going forward. While there is still regulatory uncertainty, companies can take action now by looking into how to make their operations more sustainable.Energy is a big part of the sustainability pictureWhen customers realize that they've got a variety of opportunities, whether it's a REC purchase or buying renewable energy, there's a whole world that opens up to them. They can start saying, ""Yes, we've got renewable energy coming into our facility and not only do we, as a corporation, feel good about it, our customers and employees do too.""Story continuesOur customers need solutions that fit their needsNot all of our customers are approaching energy buying in the same way. Customers may be looking at how they report certain metrics to the CDP, how to set Science Based Targets, or how to achieve a net zero declaration that that they've made publicly.When we break sustainability down for a customer, we're really trying to help them understand what the easiest steps are to achieve what they want to achieve.Different approaches require more flexibility and knowledge from usI think the concept of sustainability is a lot more rooted in how companies look at their energy spend than it's ever been. Five years ago, price was the number one consideration. People still want the best value that they can get, but now value has more factors than price.Some companies have already declared they're going to be net-zero and they're doing whatever they can to get to that point. Other customers are on very different journeys and that requires a lot more flexibility and a greater knowledge on our part.In the past, we would have had a more straightforward conversation about electrons or molecules. Now we're now talking about where they came from and how they're made. There are more decisions around that single energy purchase and the supply chain that are becoming much more important.I love seeing the way sales brings customers along on the journeyMy team is amazing. I love spending time with them. I love seeing the way sales brings customers along on the journey to the find solutions that fit their needs.If I was doing the same thing every day, I would have been bored a long time ago.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NextEra Energy Partners NEP, CVR Energy CVI, Plains All American Pipeline PAA, Euroseas ESEA and Frontline FRO.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Is Food Inflation Here to Stay?Investors are waiting for the CPI data a couple of days from now even as the big banks line up to report what looks like a rather soft quarter. Looking at the aggregate revenue and earnings trends for the S&amp;P 500 in the last few quarters, you can’t miss the way earnings growth has trailed revenue growth this year with the gap continuing to widen as we moved through the year.For the third quarter, in fact, earnings are expected to be up just 0.4% on 9% higher revenues. And if you take out the roaring energy sector, they are expected to be down -6.2%.The huge increase in raw material prices, labor shortages and elevated fuel and transportation costs have obviously taken a toll on companies and impacted their profitability, even as relatively steady demand allowed them to pass on some of the higher cost to customers. The most important factor supporting the consumer is the job market, which is still tight, despite availability coming down. For the most part, companies are still reluctant to let their people go when they might need to hire them back at a higher rate. Therefore consumers, while still impacted by inflation, are not going underwater. This in turn is supporting the continued escalation in food prices. Energy prices, the other major non-core factor in the CPI has been coming down in recent months after the release of strategic reserves.So there is a big question about food prices, and whether they may be expected to come down any time soon, given the Fed’s actions and the dire situation some lower-income groups are facing already.Story continuesFood price elevation is the result of many factors and a 1-2% increase in cost per year has been absorbed by consumers for years. But the last two years have seen extreme volatility in energy prices, which increase transportation costs for everyone, including food producers. And transporters have made the most of supply chain constraints to further drive up prices. Rising input costs and labor shortages (a secular trend exacerbated by the pandemic) also haven’t helped. The war in Ukraine has also had a significant impact. While it has affected the whole world in different ways, the impact on agricultural production has been severe. For one thing, both countries, and especially Ukraine, produces nearly a third of the world’s wheat and this supply was cut off overnight. Sanctions against Russia also have a severe impact because Russia produces a third of the world’s fertilizers. With this supply cut off, agricultural production was destined to see cost escalation.To make matters worse, America is seeing the effects of climate change.The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) says that 60% of the western, southwestern and central plains are experiencing severe drought conditions. The seventeen states included in this region from Northern Texas up to North Dakota and stretching in the west to California accounts for nearly half of the country’s agricultural production by value:“This includes 74% of beef cattle, responsible (in total) for 18% of U.S. agricultural production by value; 50% of dairy production, responsible (in total) for 11% of U.S. agricultural production by value, over 80% of wheat production by value and over 70% of vegetable, fruit and tree nut production by value. Drought conditions, which have persisted well into 2022, put production of these commodities at risk, along with the stability of farms, ranches and local economies reliant on crops, livestock and downstream products and services for income.”The AFBF conducted a survey between June 8 and July 20 this year that showed:74% of farmers are seeing a reduction in harvest yields in 2022, up from 72% last year.42% are planning to switch crops for growing season, up from 37% last year.37% are tilling under crops. This is up from 24% last year.33% are removing/destroying orchard trees and other multi-year crops (nearly double the 17% last year).39% said that wildfires contributed to crop losses and cattle sell-offs in their area (there is no data from last year).“Across the surveyed region, respondents expected average crop yields to be down 38% this year because of drought conditions, with the biggest drop expected in Texas (yields reported down 68%), followed by Oklahoma (down 60%) and New Mexico (down 54%).”Livestock farming is not any easier:66% are selling off portions of herd/flock, same as last yearInsufficient forage requiring removing of animals 71%, down from 79% last yearIncrease in local feed costs (often expensive hay) linked to drought 90%, 87% last yearFeed and forage coming from long distances away 72% (71% last year)Hauling water to livestock 60% (64% last year)Diminished access to public grazing lands 57% (no data from last year)However, as a recent Forbes article points out, production numbers from the USDA indicate that volumes are not as bad as they could have been. Soybean production is actually up 2% from last year while wheat production is up 8%, supported by the strong prices resulting from the global shortage. Corn (around two-thirds used for cattle feed and ethanol) is a concern however and expected to be down 5%, which will also make it more expensive.  The U.S. is cutting exports this year to support domestic needs.With feed and water becoming harder to come by, both because of environmental factors and government restrictions to safeguard the environment, the outlook is not bright for meat and dairy producers.ConclusionThe Fed’s actions will ultimately have a moderating effect on food price increases, likely next year. However, the above conditions point to long-term systemic issues that won’t be resolved quickly. Therefore, some modest inflation in food prices is likely to persist. Considering these concerns, it may be a better idea to avoid food stocks for now. There certainly are better stocks to pick from, such as energy or transportation companies that are responsible for some of the price increases food producers are seeing. Therefore, stocks like NextEra Energy Partners, CVR Energy, Plains All American Pipeline, Euroseas and Frontline are great picks. Not only do they have solid growth prospects stretching into 2023 but they also offer attractive dividends that can support income generation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The rate hike approval from the commission will allow the company to recover more than $220 million of investments made since 2018 in its 7,200-mile natural gas infrastructure system.The new approval rate will generate an estimated $8.8 million of new annual revenues and a return on equity of 9.6%. The funds coming in from the rate hike will assist Black Hills in achieving its Net Zero emissions target by 2035 for its natural gas distribution system.Rate hikes increase the monthly utility bills of customers, but we all need a reliable 24X7 energy supply, so strengthening and expansion of infrastructure is quite essential. Domestic-focused, capital-intensive and regulated utilities need rate hikes at regular intervals to continue with infrastructure upgrades and recoup investments made to provide quality services to their customers.Utilities Invest in InfrastructureThe ongoing hike in interest rates is hurting utilities by increasing the cost of financing and planned budget for projects. Amid such a backdrop, few utilities in the same industry having well-chalked-out investment plans for strengthening their services are NextEra Energy NEE, Alliant Energy LNT and Exelon Corporation EXC.NextEra Energy aims to invest $85-$95 billion from 2022 through 2025 to strengthen its infrastructure.

LNT has plans to strengthen electric and natural gas distribution systems and make regular investments to boost infrastructure. It plans to invest $6.1 billion between 2022 and 2025. After the planned expenditure, the company plans to follow it up with an investment of $7-$9 billion for 2026-2030. The long-term earnings growth of Alliant Energy is currently pegged at 6.16%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2.Exelon plans to invest nearly $29 billion during the 2022-2025 period in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to benefit customers. Such systematic investments are going to boost the long-term earnings of the company. The current dividend yield of the company is 3.6% and its long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.11%.

155,08e6c706-ad91-3310-97d3-95b854bb973f,PDCO,2022-10-12,Investing in Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) three years ago would have delivered you a 66% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-patterson-companies-nasdaq-pdco-175535589.html,1665510935,STORY,['PDCO'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 15% in that time. But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 49% during that period.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Patterson Companies was able to grow its EPS at 16% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Patterson Companies has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Patterson Companies' TSR for the last 3 years was 66%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 20% received by Patterson Companies shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -22%. Unfortunately, last year's performance is a deterioration of an already poor long term track record, given the loss of 3% per year over the last five years. Weak performance over the long term usually destroys market confidence in a stock, but bargain hunters may want to take a closer look for signs of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Patterson Companies (at least 2 which don't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But like many local business owners, Hoa took a major hit when the COVID-19 pandemic brought tourism in Vietnam to a standstill.Hoa considered herself fortunate. She had access to programming through CARE, a global humanitarian organization that created the Ignite program to help build entrepreneurship among underserved micro- and small-business owners. She credited the program, supported by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, for boosting her financial management skills, which helped her refine her business operations and achieve a better-work life balance. But not all women entrepreneurs can get this kind of help.All across the globe, women seeking to achieve economic empowerment often face three major obstacles: income inequality, digital inequality and information inequality.Income inequality is an ongoing problem that was only exacerbated by the pandemic: 90% of women who lost their jobs became economically inactive, pushing men and women further apart on the already inequitable economic spectrum.In today's world, digital inequality makes it even harder for women who remain in the workforce to obtain income parity. More than 50% of women are offline, and women are 20% less likely than men to own smartphones. Without access to the full power of the digital economy, female entrepreneurs cannot integrate digital technologies into their businesses to reach new customers or reap the efficiencies that technology affords.That lack of digital access also creates information inequality, in which men have more access to data and analytics that can take a business to the next level.Story continuesA Citigroup analysis earlier this year found that gender parity in business growth could increase the global GDP by as much as $2 trillion and generate between 288 million and 433 million jobs. Given that, it's clear everyone would benefit from building an economic future that works for women. Here are three principles that guide our work:01Act with gender intentionalityWe need to think about the specific barriers that women face when we design products, services and programs to deliver the best outcomes.In Pakistan, the Center is working in partnership with CARE to ensure that financial service providers are designing financial products with women entrepreneurs in mind. For instance, UBank offers a loan product that accepts nontraditional forms of collateral like gold jewelry. Its financing includes educational programs, such as skills building, mentorship and digital tools.02Make data work for womenData can serve as a powerful ally in the fight for greater equity. By collecting, analyzing and using good-quality disaggregated data, we can improve our existing products and services to suit women's needs - or spark innovative new ways to better serve women.Through Data.org, the Center has supported Women's World Banking to explore how AI-based modeling and credit scoring can assist female entrepreneurs in India, Mexico and Nigeria. The initiative assesses how algorithms in digital credit applications can increase lending to women borrowers, studies other ways to apply machine learning and AI and explores the challenges facing digital financial services as a result of COVID-19.03Reimagine cross-sector partnershipsInstead of falling back on traditional models of philanthropy and public-private partnerships, we must think creatively about how to effectively deploy our assets, including human capital, aggregated data and technology. That means rethinking how we structure partnerships with corporations, nonprofits and government entities.For instance, we teamed up with global sustainability organization BSR and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. to create a digital payment system that gave garment workers in Egypt - half of whom are women - more control over their income. At the Center, we worked with an NGO to teach garment workers how to use their new digital wallets while our brand partner, Levi's, harnessed its factory network, brand influence and philanthropic foundation to get factory management on board with the plan. Now we're working to scale that program to nine more factories supporting global brands.The world has never offered women a smooth road to financial empowerment, but we can ease their journey, from factories in Egypt to farms in Vietnam and beyond. We are working to equip women like Hoa with the knowledge and technology they need to take charge of their future - and to ensure the future is ready for them to succeed.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://bit.ly/30yXLJvEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719948/3-Ways-to-Make-the-Economy-Work-Better-for-Women]"

The platform was made available for customers in most worldwide markets the day it was launched.Built in partnership with the global source-to-settle analytics provider Robobai, the platform works by automating the process of data ingestion (transferring data from its source to a storage medium from where it can be accessed, utilized or analyzed by an organization) from the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems of customers.By getting exposed to client data, the solution empowers customers to track all payment flows occurring within their businesses, whether related to suppliers, commodities or different business lines. Additionally, the platform takes care of customer product requirements, such as card purchases, procurement offerings and Travel &amp; Entertainment (T&amp;E) technology by recording the commercial payment flows.Global Treasury Intelligence was also developed to benefit current corporate clients with streamlined digital payments for their existing corporate customers. Needless to say, the endeavor to speed up global digital payments through advanced digital solutions continues to be one of Mastercard’s longstanding endeavors.With so many benefits derived from the Mastercard platform, clients can follow a collaborative approach to chalk out apt financial strategies and gain greater visibility in the business payments domain across the globe. The task of selecting an apt supplier by clients is also eased with suppliers’ information provided by the platform, such as supplier environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring and Know Your Supplier assessments. The solution will also aid customers in enhancing risk management capabilities. Besides, fulfillment of corporate priorities, including cash management and ESG targets will be hassle-free with this newly-launched platform.Apart from allowing customers to manage their businesses effectively, the introduction of Global Treasury Intelligence hints at Mastercard’s notable efforts in strengthening its insights and analytics services portfolio.Story continuesBy leveraging the platform’s valuable insights, customers can optimally utilize and realize the complete worth of Mastercard solutions comprising Track BPS and Mastercard Instant Pay, which primarily expedite business-to-business payments.Mastercard frequently resorts to partnerships with well-established organizations or pursues significant investments for devising innovative digital payment solutions, the latest move being one.Shares of Mastercard have lost 15.5% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They were sold at 3,650 yen each, the top of the marketed range in an IPO that was upsized to 66.8 billion yen ($456 million) due to high investor interest.Semiconductor listings in Tokyo tend to perform well in their first session, Bloomberg data show. Socionext managed to attract buyers even in a weak market for IPOs in Japan, where proceeds slumped 80% this year on an annual comparison. The jump contrasts to a chip-related stocks rout that’s wiped out more than $240 billion from the sector’s global market value this week after the US imposed curbs on China’s access to technology.Socionext develops customized systems-on-chips for clients across the consumer, automotive and industrial fields. Apple Inc.’s Silicon processors and Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon line are mass-market examples of such logic processors, often referred to as the brains of electronic devices. Enterprise customers increasingly seek bespoke, application-specific chips and Socionext competes with Taiwan’s Faraday Technology Corp., Alchip Technologies Ltd. and Global Unichip Corp. to fill that demand.The company was founded in 2015 from the combination of the SoC divisions of Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd. and Panasonic.Story continuesIt’s the fourth semiconductor company to go public in Japan during the past two years, and the biggest among the country’s nine semiconductor listings in the past decade, the data show. Just one of them, RS Technologies Co., didn’t end the first session above the IPO price.Looking at the broader market, companies that debuted in Tokyo over the past two years after raising more than $100 million rose by a 28% average on the first day, Bloomberg data show.Demand for Socionext’s IPO “seems to have been strong with long-only funds taking up the deal,” said Clarence Chu, an analyst at Aequitas Research who publishes on Smartkarma. The company is among global chip players attempting to expand in the fast-growing automotive tech industry, with sales to the segment “continually” rising, and had its shares priced “at a more attractive valuation” than peers listed in Japan, the US and Taiwan, he said.SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Mizuho Securities Co. Ltd., Rakuten Securities and Monex were principal underwriting participants in the offering.(Updates with closing price)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketHow Gamers Beat NFTsExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look LikeTaking ‘Abrasive’ and ‘Nice’ Out of Performance Reviews©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

As of right now, we're still lower by about 3/10 of a percent, though. Taking a look at the NASDAQ composite, you're also seeing that lower by about 1 and 1/2% here intraday and still in the same ballpark of some of those early session lows, as we're just about 37 minutes into today's trading activity here on this Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500, that, too, down a little more than 1%.Taking a look, though, a little further into some of the travel names that we've been tracking. And there's really only one bright spot, and it's barely holding on to some of those gains that had come as a result of an update. That from American Airlines. It's holding onto gains by the hair of its chinny-chin-chin right now. That compared to being up by 4% pre-market. And so now you're seeing some of that sputtering out.But continue to watch this broader travel and kind of reopening play, if you will, because even though some of the demand that the airlines have cited as being strong, even though some of that demand persists, and the taking price from-- and in the midst of this kind of higher demand, taking price to consumers and having consumers still accept that, even though that's locked into place, it's still a question of what the capacity will look like for them.And so that's something that American had talked about. And now you're seeing AAL dip into the red. But more broadly, continue to watch Airbnb. That's down by about 6% here on the day.

In its Q3 2022 investor letter, the fund mentioned that investors may have different expectations concerning inflation, interest rates, or economic growth, but, at the end of the day, what we buy will determine the portfolio’s return (and its risk). The fund also said that the need for capital investment over the long term has been, and will likely remain, higher than it anticipated. Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund mentioned Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1995, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based aerospace company with a $108.7 billion market capitalization. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) delivered a 15.36% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 14.82%. The stock closed at $409.99 per share on October 10, 2022.Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence...""

180,8a6d15f4-58c9-3f0a-bc64-979d7ea119bd,LMT,2022-10-12,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-expected-beat-140002087.html,1665496802,STORY,['LMT'],"[The market expects Lockheed Martin (LMT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.5%.Revenues are expected to be $16.79 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.99, delivering a surprise of +14.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lockheed Martin (LMT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.69 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $6.69 Most Accurate Estimate and the $6.63 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 0.97%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The contract involves providing M299 All Up Launchers and spare parts support for the U.S. Army and international customers. The deal was awarded by the U.S. Army and is expected to be complete by 2025.Importance of M299 LauncherThe M299 Launcher is the go-to solution for multiple aircraft and ground platforms for defending, deterring and defeating current and future threats. It provides an affordable multi-platform, multi-mission capability for the HELLFIRE and Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (“JAGM”).It boasts the capability to operate in severe flight environments, with a digital design that allows interfacing with a variety of platforms. Moreover, the M299 Launcher has the unique ability to recognize and fire all HELLFIRE variants and JAGM in any plausible sequence.Due to its remarkable features that are well-suited for any military mission, it has been integrated into the AH-64D, AH-64E, Seahawk, Cobra, Tigre and numerous other platforms for the U.S. and international customers. Its strong demand can be gauged from the delivery of more than 6000 of these launchers to varied customers.Also, the M299 Launcher is currently in service with 29 customers and has an exceeded specified operational reliability of 99% per mission.Backed by such strong demand, LMT may continue to witness a steady flow of contracts involving the missile launching system. The latest contract win is a testament to the same. This should bolster Lockheed Martin’s revenues from the missile launcher system.Growth ProspectsThe Russia-Ukraine warfare has led many nations to increase their defense spending to strengthen their defense landscape. In this context, missiles, forming an integral part of an efficient defense system, have been witnessing increased demand lately.Per Mordor Intelligence projections, the missiles and missile defense system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.9% over the 2022-2027 period. Such projections further exemplify immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to capitalize on the expanding market with its missile launching system.Story continuesSuch abounding growth projections will also benefit other prominent defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC, Raytheon Technologies RTX and General Dynamics GD.Northrop Grumman is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC shares have returned 28.2% in the past year.Raytheon Technologies’ Missiles &amp; Defense is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems. The unit serves as a prime contractor or major subcontractor on numerous missile and related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense.Raytheon’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2022 earnings suggests a growth rate of 9.1% from the prior-year reported figure.General Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It produces composite rocket motor cases and launches tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%. GD shares have returned 11.1% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 14.9% against the industry’s fall of 21.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

At the same time, the Dow added 0.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.07%.Heading into today, shares of the homebuilder had lost 5.39% over the past month, outpacing the Construction sector's loss of 8.69% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 11.07% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PulteGroup as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. In that report, analysts expect PulteGroup to post earnings of $2.76 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 51.65%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.05 billion, up 16.38% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.15 per share and revenue of $16.72 billion. These totals would mark changes of +52.74% and +20.08%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PulteGroup.

As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

This will be followed by transportation (48.1%), autos (31.6%), consumer discretionary (22.2%) and construction (24.5%) sectors.DIA in FocusSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $26.2 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares.

188,a317b220-69cf-3fcb-8357-d40729bc704c,JNJ,2022-10-12,Earnings Preview: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-johnson-johnson-jnj-140002442.html,1665496802,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.2%.Revenues are expected to be $23.58 billion, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.51% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson &amp; Johnson?For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson &amp; Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Johnson &amp; Johnson would post earnings of $2.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering a surprise of +0.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more of the valuable companies, go directly to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow indices have experienced a significant dip since the start of 2022, providing attractive investment opportunities to long-term investors. Jeremy Siegel, a renowned finance professor at Wharton Business School, believes that some of the best long-term stocks are trading at very cheap valuations in the market currently. He believes that the raging inflation, hovering around a four-decade high, can be expected to come under control as the housing market is cooling down. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government has increased the money supply by 40%, and historically, earnings have increased with an expansion in the money supply. Mr. Siegel observed that, at one point, numerous established stocks saw a surge of 50% to 55% compared to their levels before the pandemic. However, the recent weakness in the stock market has pulled back these gains to around 20% only, bringing down the valuation of companies.It is widely believed that the majority of the wealth created in the stock market is due to the success of the best long-term stocks, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A study conducted at the business school of Arizona State University concluded that over 55% of the stocks listed in the US and 57% of the stocks listed in other leading stock markets globally underperformed in comparison to the relative performance of risk-free US Treasury bonds during the three-decade period between 1990 and 2020. Meanwhile, over $75 trillion of the global wealth created in the stock markets was due to the strong performance of only 2.4% of the stocks listed on these exchanges. This makes it necessary to undertake careful research to identify the best long-term stocks and avoid underperforming stocks that are in the majority.Story continuesPhoto by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur Methodology We have shortlisted the best long-term stocks after looking into the past performance of these companies and the future prospects being offered. While these stocks might not have experienced the highest stock price appreciation in the recent past, they have been able to generate significant shareholder wealth by offering healthy dividends and share buyback programs.

Here’s what the firm said:“Remarkably, the Nasdaq-100 and Russell 2000 indices are up 6.25% and 3.90% through 3/31/22, respectively, since the war started. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) went up 57% from its low on February 24 ($700) to the close on March 29th ($1099), which equates to an advance of $413 billion.

Mehta also added that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) could repurpose its crude oil refining facilities into biofuel, chemical, lubricant, and plastic recycling facilities.Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has generated returns of over 60% in the last year.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”As of Q2 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was held by 72 hedge funds.8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Hsinchu, Taiwan-based leading semiconductor manufacturing company that has a wide range of applications in the electronics industry.Rick Hsu at Daiwa upgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) from a Buy to an Outperform rating on September 14.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) bright growth prospects make it one of the best long-term stocks to invest in.RiverPark Funds discussed its stance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Taiwan Semiconductor detracted from performance despite a business performance that saw revenue accelerate to over +30% growth. The Company is one of the few fabs in the world that is capable of manufacturing leading-edge integrated circuits (IC). The Company’s leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly by Apple, which has become an integrated circuit powerhouse over the past decade.The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

Here’s what the firm said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson was among the 2 largest trims at around 1% each. Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”Fisher Asset Management raised its stake in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) by 798% during Q2 2022.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the most prominent firms in the global financial services industry.

(NYSE:JPM) fits this criterion as it is amongst some of the leading banks with high dividend yields trading at very low valuations. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has generated strong returns on equity (ROE) consistently and is well-positioned to continue this trend.  Ariel Investments shared its stance on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon. Inflationary expectations are only now working themselves into the labor market with historically low unemployment, resurgent labor unions, and higher wages. These labor cost pressures are only starting to show up in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent Producer Price Index showed a +9% year over year increase, the highest since it was created in 2010. Higher input prices generally lead to rising consumer prices.“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon.” Consumer balance sheets are in excellent shape with lower unemployment and banked stimulus checks. A recent analysis from JP Morgan Chase (JPM) showed average checking accounts have 50% higher balances than pre-Covid. The U.S. money supply as measured by M2 (a calculation that includes cash, checking accounts, and “near cash” such as money market securities) is up +38% versus year-end 2019. Higher consumer cash holdings and higher money supply mean more spending and demand for goods. Some emphasize supply issues to explain current inflation.

This approval is based on the results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival.1Merck Canada logo (CNW Group/Merck Canada)""It is estimated that in 2022 over eight thousand Canadians will be diagnosed with kidney and renal pelvis cancer, of which renal cell carcinoma is the most common type,2"" said Christine Collins, Executive Director, Kidney Cancer Canada. ""For people who are impacted by RCC, having a new treatment option following surgery, can offer patients and their loved ones support in managing the disease.""RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer, making up for more than 90% of cases of kidney cancer.3 It occurs most often in people over 50, and is more common in men than in women. Some of the risk factors include smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure.4 Given the impact on patients, there is active research in understanding the molecular biology of the disease and improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and availability of treatment options.5""We are proud to be bringing another innovation in the management of renal cell carcinoma to Canadians, because this is our mission – to help improve the lives of those impacted by cancer by providing additional treatment options,"" said Marwan Akar, President and Managing Director of Merck Canada.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.12%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.07%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the pharmaceutical company had gained 2.63% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 8.25% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 11.07% in that time.Merck will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Merck to post earnings of $1.74 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.57%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.4 billion, up 9.47% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.33 per share and revenue of $59.04 billion, which would represent changes of +21.76% and +17.72%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Merck. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.24% higher. Merck is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Merck has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.34 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.38, so we one might conclude that Merck is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that MRK has a PEG ratio of 1.22.

To her knowledge, no cross-border student exchange programs for scientific research were available to her. She was able to attend college and graduate school in the US and eventually joined the University of California San Diego as a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 2012. As the first Latina engineering professor to be hired at the school, Graeve wanted to help other students make connections between advanced science study and career paths.The summer after she joined UC San Diego, she founded ENLACE (Spanish for ""link""), a program that uses science and engineering as a bridge for high school and college students to build professional connections and personal friendships. Its goal, Graeve says, is to empower them with the skills to choose a career in the sciences and pursue a doctorate.Prospective high school and college students from Mexico and the US apply with their scientific interests in mind. Graeve and her colleagues then help match them with professors who mentor the students for a summer. During their summer experiences, the students work in fields ranging from marine biology to the physical sciences, and even get a chance to contribute to published manuscripts.The program has expanded every year, from five students in 2013 to 185 in 2022. With ENLACE's significant growth comes the need for additional funding, which is put toward scholarships: Graeve says they want to create opportunities for all kinds of students, regardless of their socioeconomic status. The scholarships help cover participants' room and board for the duration of their research experience.To tackle this, Graeve began reaching out to local companies in the San Diego area, which she says are the most interested in local students' development. This year, Illumina Corporate Foundation provided funding for 14 students as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) program-one of the company's main focus areas is increasing equitable access to STEM education.Story continues""ENLACE is a one-of-a-kind program that unites students from both the US and Mexico through science and engineering. It provides real-world lab experience to students so they can explore the possibilities of solving societal issues relating to equity, inclusion, and social justice,"" says Vanessa Light, the CSR program manager at Illumina. ""The work that Graeve is doing with these students is a perfect intersection of the power of bringing together communities through science and we are proud to support it.""UC San Diego is globally recognized for its academics as well as for supporting diversity. Nature Index ranked it ninth among the world's best biomedical research institutions. One in three women at UC San Diego graduates with a STEM degree-the highest proportion of any college in the US, and three times the national average.UC San Diego's main campus is less than two miles from Illumina's worldwide headquarters, about 30 miles from the US-Mexico border. The institutions lie within the binational megaregion that comprises San Diego and Imperial counties in California and the state of Baja California, which has a combined population of 7.1 million and an economy worth $230 billion. And there are STEM career opportunities on both sides of the border: San Diego has the third highest number of life science and biotech jobs in the US, and Tijuana has become known as the world capital of medical device manufacturing.Illumina, Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureENLACE has been invaluable for students from a range of backgrounds. Evan Sandoval was an undergraduate studying nanotechnology in Tijuana when a biology professor encouraged him to apply for ENLACE in 2017. The program showed him a path to pursuing research as a career while allowing him to explore a new area of science.""ENLACE [made] a big change in my life, as an opportunity that not only helped me start the career I am in, but also made me rethink the area of science I was interested in,"" Sandoval says. Although he'd been studying nanotechnology engineering, he was also interested in plant biology-particularly how it's tied to food security in the face of climate change.It could have been difficult to switch fields between undergraduate and graduate school, but ENLACE gave him that chance. Now he's a third-year PhD student in the same lab ENLACE had placed him in, studying the genes involved in plants' stress response. Considering that, he says, ""I want to continue my career in research, and I'm not sure I would be here if [not for] ENLACE.""To learn more about Illumina STEM Education programs, visit www.illumina.com/stem.Illumina, Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719911/UC-San-Diego-Students-Cross-Borders-and-Explore-New-Fields-in-STEM]"

(SO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this power company have returned -20.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.1% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which Southern Co. belongs, has lost 16.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Southern Co. is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 points to a change of +5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.80 indicates a change of +5.2% from what Southern Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Southern Co.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Southern Co. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.63 billion and $27.54 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthern Co. reported revenues of $7.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +38.6%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +28.11%. The EPS surprise was +27.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southern Co. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southern Co. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The deal was awarded by the U.S. Army and is expected to be complete by 2025.Importance of M299 LauncherThe M299 Launcher is the go-to solution for multiple aircraft and ground platforms for defending, deterring and defeating current and future threats. It provides an affordable multi-platform, multi-mission capability for the HELLFIRE and Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (“JAGM”).It boasts the capability to operate in severe flight environments, with a digital design that allows interfacing with a variety of platforms. Moreover, the M299 Launcher has the unique ability to recognize and fire all HELLFIRE variants and JAGM in any plausible sequence.Due to its remarkable features that are well-suited for any military mission, it has been integrated into the AH-64D, AH-64E, Seahawk, Cobra, Tigre and numerous other platforms for the U.S. and international customers. Its strong demand can be gauged from the delivery of more than 6000 of these launchers to varied customers.Also, the M299 Launcher is currently in service with 29 customers and has an exceeded specified operational reliability of 99% per mission.Backed by such strong demand, LMT may continue to witness a steady flow of contracts involving the missile launching system. The latest contract win is a testament to the same.

Such projections further exemplify immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to capitalize on the expanding market with its missile launching system.Story continuesSuch abounding growth projections will also benefit other prominent defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC, Raytheon Technologies RTX and General Dynamics GD.Northrop Grumman is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC shares have returned 28.2% in the past year.Raytheon Technologies’ Missiles &amp; Defense is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”4. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), the American retailer of athletic footwear and apparel, offers a range of products including shoes, jerseys, and cleats for sports activities such as association football, basketball, track and field, combat sports, tennis, golf, ice hockey, and cross training for men, women, and children. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also sponsored the American professional golfer, Tiger Woods, for most of his career.Bank of America analyst Lorraine Hutchinson observed on October 11 that bulls remain focused on a margin recovery in FY24 for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), citing easing foreign exchange headwinds and a fast recovery in China. On October 3, Baird analyst Jonathan Komp maintained an Outperform rating on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) but lowered the price target on the stock to $100 from $127. The analyst said despite his recent attempts to factor in current macro risks, the company negatively surprised by disclosing robust global consumer demand, but much higher-than-expected inventory and a meaningfully lower short-term earnings/margin outlook given actions needed to clear surplus inventory plus incremental currency movements.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 72 hedge funds were long NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder in the company, with 8.5 million shares worth about $873 million. Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Started from humble beginnings as Phil Knight’s “crazy idea” in a Stanford entrepreneurship class, Nike marked its 50th anniversary this year. By remaining true to its innovative culture, the brand is as strong as ever and continues to generate attractive growth, soon to surpass $50 billion in annual revenue. In addition to the continuous investments in brand innovation and marketing, over the last few years Nike has invested heavily to lay the foundation for multi-channel commerce. Today, Nike generates approximately 40% of its revenues through its online channel and branded storefronts. Empowered by CEO John Donahoe’s “Nike Consumer Direct Offense,” Nike’s ongoing investments are expected to further drive their overall revenue mix towards the direct-to-consumer channel which we estimate will result in substantial margin improvement over the next three to five years.While Nike’s business in China, which accounts for approximately 20% of revenue, is experiencing challenges today, our due diligence suggests that consumer preference for the Nike brand outside the U.S. remains incredibly strong. Overall, we expect Nike’s broader ecosystem, often referred to as the Nike Marketplace, to continue to leverage the company’s innovation and premier brand to build direct consumer relationships which deepen Nike’s competitive moat and enhance its financial profile. Turbulence in the Chinese market and concerns over consumer spending in the US and Europe enabled us to initiate a position in Nike at an attractive discount to our appraisal of the company’s long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 3 Best Golf Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Hydrogen Stocks To Buy Now11 Best Motley Fool Stocks To Buy10 Best Global Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 6 Best Golf Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NKE) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-nike-inc-nke-130001661.html,1665493201,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -22.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has lost 20.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.14 points to a change of -16.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -17%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.97 indicates a change of +26.5% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -13.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $48.97 billion and $53.33 billion estimates indicate +4.9% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVAX announced that Switzerland’s Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has recommended the use of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373), as a heterologous and homologous booster dose in adults aged 18 years and above in Switzerland.Following the FOPH recommendation, Nuvaxovid can now be administered as a booster dose in adults irrespective of whether or not the primary vaccine regimen series was completed with Nuvaxovid.This decision by FOPH will enable Novavax to target a larger segment of the adult population in Switzerland, who have already completed a primary vaccination series with a vaccine of another company but are yet to receive a booster dose.Last month, Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, extended the temporary authorization of Nuvaxovid for use in adolescents aged 12-17 and as a booster dose for adults 18 years and older.Swissmedic had previously granted temporary authorization to Nuvaxovid for use in adults 18 years or older earlier this year.As a booster dose, the Nuvaxovid vaccine has already been authorized for use in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Israel and the European Union.Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine was granted authorization for use in adolescents aged 12-17 in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, India and several other countries earlier this year.In a separate press release, Novavax announced that its partner, SK bioscience has submitted a Post Approval Change Application to the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, for use of Nuvaxovid as a heterologous and homologous booster in adults aged 18 years and above. The vaccine is already approved in South Korea for primary vaccination in the country.The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that Nuvaxovid can be used off-label as a booster dose in adults last month.Shares of Novavax were up 9.1% on Monday, following the announcement of positive developments related to Nuvaxovid in Switzerland and South Korea. However, the stock has plunged 87.6% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 27.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite being one of few companies to obtain authorizations for its COVID-19 vaccine in several countries worldwide, Novavax faces certain challenges for the vaccine to grow as it is a late entrant in the COVID-19 vaccine market, which is dominated by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA.Though most of the population is already vaccinated with the primary vaccine dose, booster doses are still pending so there can be demand for boosters, which might be beneficial for NVAX to gain a strong foothold in the COVID-19 vaccines market.Meanwhile, in September 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden said that the pandemic is over in the United States in an interview over the weekend on “60 Minutes” on CBS News. This resulted in a decline in stocks of PFE/BNTX, MRNA and NVAX.The President said that though there was still a problem with COVID and a “lot of work” was going on for that, the pandemic was over. He said that the fact that no one is wearing masks suggests the pandemic is over in the country.Pharma giant, Pfizer’s stock was hurt by Biden’s comment as its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral, Paxlovid, accounts for almost half of its revenues.Stocks of Moderna, BioNTech and Novavax are expected to decline in the long run as their sales and profits will fall once the pandemic ends. This is because COVID-related vaccines and products were their only top-line drivers.Zacks RankNovavax currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more immunotherapy stocks, go directly to 5 Best Immunotherapy Stocks To Buy Now.The global immunotherapy market is rapidly evolving as technological, regulatory, and economic trends combine to alter the growth and risk dynamics within the industry. According to a report by market research firm BCC Research, the global market for immunotherapy drugs could be worth more than $204 billion in value by 2025, up from $139 billion in 2020, representing an annual growth rate of close to 8%. The estimates are based on analysis of new products, regulatory scenarios, and the challenges and opportunities affecting market growth. Within the immunotherapy universe, cancer immunotherapies are the largest market. According to data compiled by the American Cancer Society, of all drug approvals between 2010 and 2018, 27% were cancer therapies, compared with 4% in the 1980s. Despite this explosive growth, cancer remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. To put this figure into context, the coronavirus pandemic killed about 3 million people in the same year. Growth Drivers and Challenges Abound for Immunotherapy MarketplaceInvestors eager to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the sector should monitor some of the best immunotherapy stocks that include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). In recent years, immunotherapy research has evolved to include trials studying combinations such as kill switches, removable protein masks, or linkers that bring immune cells and tumor cells into proximity in order to tamp down side-effects. There are several reasons that are holding back even faster development within the immunotherapy marketplace. These include the high cost of cancer immunotherapies, strict rules and regulations related to government policies in some regions, manufacturing process related complexities, and concern regarding side effects. The growth drivers, on the other hand, include the increasing prevalence of autoimmune diseases among adults and growing investments in the research and funding of cancer. Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the immunotherapy sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some additional context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for these stocks are also discussed. The latest pipeline drugs of these firms, under various stages of their development, are mentioned as well for further clarity.

If you want to see some more of the best ethical stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Ethical Stocks To Buy Now.Sometimes investing is more than about just making money. Investing can also be used to make a positive contribution to the world. Ethical stock investing concerns investing in stocks that could help save lives or make the environment more sustainable. Given the importance of ethics, realizing the best returns isn't as important as what the company does and how many lives it can improve.Ethical investing can be considered as a subset of ESG Investing, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance investing. In ESG investing, investors use non-financial factors to identify opportunities such as whether the investment can help fight against climate change or whether a company is advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates at five consecutive meetings, the benchmark interest rate is now at 3-3.25%, the highest it has been since 2008. As a result of the increases, borrowing costs have gone up and businesses are finding it harder to make profits. Although the increases in interest rates could help lower demand to help fight inflation, the increases can take some time to take effect. In the mean time, the stock market has to deal with higher inflation and rising interest rates at the same time, which isn't good for some companies' earnings.In these uncertain times, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio with investments in many different sectors. In the sector of ESG investing, here are some of the best ethical stocks to consider.biotech research company, bio-technology companiesCopyright: mikkolem / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Ethical Stocks To Buy Now, we took Tesla which is an electric vehicle company that can help save the environment and Deere &amp; Company which helps make food that people need in addition to leading drug companies that could help develop cures for many of today's ailments.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) shares have increased 3.2% year to date.Aristotle Capital said the following in its Q2 2022 investor letter about Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN),""Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”55 hedge funds in our database were long Amgen, Inc.

(NYSE:PFE) in its second quarter investor letter,“We initiated a new position in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in the health care sector. In addition to helping to balance our exposure to more cyclical sectors of the market, Pfizer’s strong windfall from its COVID-19 vaccines has swelled the company’s free cash flow to a magnitude we feel is not adequately reflected at its current valuation. The inundation of cash into Pfizer’s war chest leaves it wellpositioned to buy ample assets to refill and expand its pharmaceutical pipeline.

The company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming chip demand, ongoing supply-chain issues are also hurting data center chip market.The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues. Trade war between the US and China also remains a key concern.However, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA growth.

Crypto transactions are final so there's not much that you can do, right?Well, not so fast.To ensure that stolen crypto gets returned to its rightful owner, a group of Stanford researchers recently raised the idea of introducing reversible transactions to Ethereum. If such a standard were to be adopted, your stolen 10 ETH could, in theory at least, boomerang back into your wallet, the frustrated thief being left out of pocket.J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.Reversibility would probably be a popular feature, especially among the risk-averse who have until now refused to adopt Ethereum. But there are costs to consider, too.With any payments system, tweaking one element to solve a particular problem means introducing a new set of problems somewhere else along the network. There's no such thing as a free fix. Let’s dig into what these costs are.Reversible transactions on EthereumCrypto theft is everywhere, from large-scale exploits to small retail phishing scams. To make the crypto economy safer, Kaili Wang and colleagues have floated the idea of introducing an Ethereum token standard that allows transactions to be temporarily reversible. During that time period, say four days, a victim of a theft could appeal to a decentralized adjudicator to have their stolen crypto returned.Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the Bitcoin blockchain, would be shocked. After all, Nakamoto's white paper can be read as a diatribe against reversible transactions. Financial institutions ""cannot avoid mediating disputes,"" wrote Nakamoto, and as a result merchants must be ""wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.""Story continuesBut the Stanford researchers don’t intend for Ethereum to be 100% reversible. People who don't like the idea of reversible tokens could continue to limit their interactions to non-reversible tokens. As for those who are intimidated by the high degree of expertise required to safely use Ethereum, reversible tokens could be the extra guardrail that draws them in.Now the costs.Welcome, reversal fraudPayments systems involve many complex trade-offs. Solving one problem means adding another problem. A good way to think about this is in terms of the following too-small-blanket dilemma.Say that you want to go to sleep but your blanket doesn't cover your toes. You pull it down, but now your neck is uncovered. You rotate the blanket to cover both your toes and neck, but now your shoulders are exposed. There is no perfect fix. You need to pick and choose what part of your body to cover and what part to leave exposed.The same goes for payments. While reversibility may help reduce theft, the too-small-blanket dilemma dictates that it could open the network up to new problems, in particular forms of reversal fraud.Credit card systems provide a good idea of what to expect.Credit card owners can dispute card payments and have them “charged back,” or reversed. While this feature protects honest users from card theft, fraudsters take advantage of this feature by making purchases and then disputing the charge, falsely claiming they have not received the item or service. Merchants lose billions of dollars every year to credit card chargeback fraud.Read more: Stanford Proposal for Reversible Ethereum Transactions Divides Crypto CommunityOr take the example of PayPal. For risk-averse shoppers, the ability to dispute and reverse PayPal transactions is a helpful feature. But it has given rise to all sorts of PayPal fraud. In a PayPal overpayment scam, for instance, a scammer takes advantage of PayPal's dispute system to overpay a seller for something, then asks the seller for a refund of the excess. After the overpayment is returned, the scammer asks PayPal to reverse the original transaction. The seller effectively loses the overpayment amount.PayPal or Visa could do away with overpayment scams and chargeback fraud by making all transactions non-reversible. But then their systems would become less friendly for risk-averse buyers, and adoption would suffer. It's the too-small-blanket problem.My gut feeling is, go for it.So the price to pay for reversible Ethereum transactions is an inevitable wave of reversal fraud. The decentralized judicial system the Stanford researchers envisaged would quickly be flooded with scammers trying to take advantage of that very reversibility. Weeding out these scams would increase the judges’ overall adjudicating costs.Providing a degree of protection from theft may very well be worth the hassles of reversal fraud. But the point to remember is this: There is a price to pay for introducing new features. Nothing is free.Not so fungibleIntroducing reversibility to Ethereum would also have implications for fungibility. When something is fungible, assets are perfectly interchangeable. Fungibility is an attractive feature of a payment system. If all dollars are interchangeable, then it makes the dollar payments system easier to use.Reversibility would split the Ethereum network in half. Rather than swapping reversible tokens with each other, sophisticated traders would mostly stick to non-reversible tokens. The prospect of having one's $10 million trade unwound because of an appeal by a previous owner for a reverse is just too risky.But not-so-sophisticated users would probably choose the peace-of-mind of reversible tokens.Splitting the network in half wouldn't be a big deal if the two token types traded on a 1:1 basis. Alas, they probably wouldn't.An opt-in reversible standard would create a warmer and fuzzier Ethereum.Imagine that Jack owes 100 stablecoins to Jill. There are two ways that Jack can pay Jill, with reversible stablecoins or non-reversible ones. Jill will prefer the non-reversible ones. Reversible ones introduce the risk that a transaction will be unwound, leaving her out of pocket. And so she’ll tell Jack that he can either pay her 100 worth of non-reversible stablecoin or 105 in reversible ones. That’s non-fungibility.As the four-day reversibility window comes to a close and the danger of a reverse ends, reversible stablecoins would move back to par with regular non-reversible stablecoins. But until then there would be two different prices for the same instrument.It's another instance of the too-small-blanket dilemma. By adding a new layer of protection, an extra layer of confusion has been introduced.The Ethereum network would still be usable. Much of the extra burden of non-fungibility would probably be borne by specialist risk appraisers, or brokers, who profit by buying consumers' reversible tokens at a discount (in exchange for non-reversible tokens), and holding them to maturity. As Satoshi suggested, these intermediaries may have to “hassle customers” for extra information in order to protect against reversals.Even after considering the twin costs of non-fungibility and new types of Ethereum-based fraud, reversible transactions may still be worth it. While non-reversibility may be great for traders, corporations and the tech elite, the enduring popularity of PayPal and credit cards demonstrate that what regular folks want is safety. An opt-in reversible standard would create a warmer and fuzzier Ethereum, one that is more inclusive and attracts a wider range of users.My gut feeling is, go for it.]"

Strong proponents say the shift helps circumvent a needless barrier to workplace diversity.“I really do believe an inclusive diverse workforce is better for your company, it’s good for the business,” Ginni Rometty, former IBM CEO, told Fortune Media CEO Alan Murray during a panel last month for Connect, Fortune’s executive education community. “That’s not just altruistic.”Under Rometty’s leadership in 2016, tech giant IBM coined the term “new collar jobs” in reference to roles that require a specific set of skills rather than a four-year degree. It’s a personal commitment for Rometty, one that hits close to home for the 40-year IBM veteran.When Rometty was 16, her father left the family, leaving her mother, who’d never worked outside the home, suddenly in the position to provide.“She had four children and nothing past high school, and she had to get a job to…get us out of this downward spiral,” Rometty recalled to Murray. “What I saw in that was that my mother had aptitude; she wasn’t dumb, she just didn’t have access, and that forever stayed in my mind.”When Rometty became CEO in 2012 following the Great Recession, the U.S. unemployment rate hovered around 8%. Despite the influx of applicants, she struggled to find employees who were trained in the particular cybersecurity area she was looking for.“I realized I couldn’t hire them, so I had to start building them,” she said.The kids ‘could do the work’In 2011, IBM launched a corporate social responsibility effort called the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) in Brooklyn. It’s since expanded to 11 states in the U.S. and 28 countries.Through P-TECH, Rometty visited “a very poor high school in a bad neighborhood” that received the company’s support, as well as a community college where IBM was offering help with a technology-based curriculum and internships.Story continues“Voilà! These kids could do the work. I didn’t have [applicants with] college degrees, so I learned that propensity to learn is way more important than just having a degree,” Rometty said.Realizing the students were fully capable of the tasks that IBM needed moved Rometty to return to the drawing board when it came to IBM’s own application process and whom it was reaching. She said that at the time, 95% of job openings at IBM required a four-year degree. As of January 2021, less than half do, and the company is continuously reevaluating its roles.For the jobs that now no longer require degrees and instead rely on skills and willingness to learn, IBM had always hired Ph.D. holders from the very best Ivy League schools, Rometty told Murray. But data shows that the degree-less hires for the same jobs performed just as well. “They were more loyal, higher retention, and many went on to get college degrees,” she said.Rometty has since become cochair of OneTen, a civic organization committed to hiring, promoting, and advancing 1 million Black individuals without four-year degrees within the next 10 years.If college degrees no longer become compulsory for white-collar jobs, many other qualifications—skills that couldn’t be easily taught in a boot camp, apprenticeship program, or in the first month on the job—could die off, too, University of Virginia Darden School of Business professor Sean Martin told Fortune last year.“The companies themselves miss out on people that research suggests…might be less entitled, more culturally savvy, more desirous of being there,” Martin said. Rather than pedigree, he added, hiring managers should look for motivation.That’s certainly the case at IBM. Once the company widened its scope, Rometty said, the propensity to learn quickly became more of an important hiring factor than just a degree.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: A 2007 flashback: home flippers are in trouble againManaging Gen Z is like working with people ‘from a different country’The Renault Nissan empire once held together by fugitive Carlos Ghosn may slowly be unravelingPayPal tells users it will fine them $2,500 for misinformation, then backtracks immediately]"

The company commenced production from the Berkine fields six months after receiving the development contract. Eni and Sonatrach operate the Berkine basin license.Eni and partners are currently producing 1 million cubic meters (mcm) per day of gas and 4,000 barrels per day of associated liquids from the Berkine South. The capacity is expected to increase to 2 mcm per day of gas by the end of 2022. This will help the Menzel Ledjmet East facility reach a capacity of 11 mcm per day.Algeria has been an important source of gas supplies to Europe, as the continent is concerned over reduced Russia gas supplies. Eni is likely to add the new production volumes to its Berkine Nord contract and other regional activities. This will likely boost Algeria’s gas exports. Eni’s Algeria production is expected to reach more than 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 after executing development programs in the Berkine basin.Eni has been contributing to Algeria’s growth since 1981.

254,adfe8b82-ee76-3e03-8780-fe49feca35ae,MPC,2022-10-12,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Marathon Petroleum a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123012349.html,1665491412,STORY,"['MPC', 'MRO', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']","[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Marathon Petroleum (MPC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marathon Petroleum's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marathon Petroleum's main business drivers.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum operates in two segments: Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation.Refining and Marketing: The unit’s operations include 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent regions of the United States, having a combined crude processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day. Additionally, Marathon Petroleum – through its marketing organization – sells transportation fuels, asphalt and specialty products throughout the country to support commercial, industrial and retail operations. In 2021, the Refining &amp; Marketing segment recorded a profit of $1 billion.Story continuesMidstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP - publicly-traded master limited partnerships that own and operate gathering and processing assets along with crude transportation and logistics infrastructure. Marathon Petroleum owns 63.6% each of MPLX’s and ANDX’s common units. The 'Midstream' segment reported total earnings of $4.1 billion in 2021.Last year, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain – for $21 billion.As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 billion and a total debt, including that of MPLX, of $25.5 billion.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Marathon Petroleum ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $3,835.80, or a gain of 283.58%, as of October 11, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 152.16% and the price of gold went up -9.25% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for MPC.Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil Refining &amp; Marketing industry in a year (+66.9% versus +34.7%) and is poised for further price gains based on a slew of tailwinds. One of the largest oil refiners in the United States, Marathon’s $21 billion sale of its Speedway retail business provided the company with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. The company’s exposure to the more stable cash flows from logistics segment diversifies earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed a preferred downstream operator to own now.The stock is up 6.12% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 5 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

257,45435c88-5693-3a5e-8a7c-8e001b591ca0,AES,2022-10-12,AES' (NYSE:AES) investors will be pleased with their stellar 160% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-nyse-aes-investors-pleased-113347378.html,1665574427,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) share price down 10% in the last month. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 121% in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for AES To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.We know that AES has been profitable in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. So it might be better to look at other metrics to try to understand the share price.The revenue growth of 2.4% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for AES in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for AES the TSR over the last 5 years was 160%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that AES shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 5.6% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 21% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand AES better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - AES has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(PRNewsFoto/SunPower Corp.)The home energy system and installation services are slated to be available alongside the retail launch of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, expected Fall 2023. With bi-directional charging capabilities, the Silverado EV paired with a home energy system is expected to provide enough electricity to provide whole home backup1 during a grid outage.""We are proud to work alongside GM, a stalwart in American innovation, to seamlessly connect home energy and electric vehicles. This is a vital next step toward making an all-electric lifestyle easy and even more beneficial,"" said Peter Faricy, SunPower CEO. ""Through this collaboration, we are making it easy for EV drivers to power their vehicles with clean energy and providing new ways to offer energy resiliency and peace-of-mind.""Once available, Chevrolet Silverado EV customers will be able to have their home energy system installed at the same time as their Silverado EV charger to enable vehicle-to-home (V2H) power or choose to do so at a later date. For interested customers, SunPower and GM will assess the home's electrical system for compatibility with bi-directional charging. Customers can also choose to purchase a SunPower® solar system for their home.Story continuesAn EV customer with solar can charge their vehicle with energy generated from their rooftop system, which is cleaner and often less expensive than charging from the grid. Customers with a home energy system, compatible EV and properly equipped home are also expected to be able to store solar-generated electricity in their vehicle's battery and export it directly into their home during the hours when electricity costs the most. This provides an opportunity for them to save even more money on electricity bills depending on home size, energy usage and utility rates.""The collaboration with SunPower is a shining example of how GM is working with industry leaders to accelerate our all-electric future and unlock greater value potential for GM Energy customers,"" said Travis Hester, vice president of GM's EV Growth Operations.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Toyota TM, Honda HMC, Stellantis STLA, General Motors GM and Ford F.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Auto Majors End Q3 Mixed, Q4 Prospects GloomyEven though a few automakers witnessed a year-over-year uptick in U.S. new vehicle sales in the third quarter, overall sales volume was stuck in low gear. Per US Automotive News, sales volumes inched down 0.4% year over year. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for September came in at 13.7 million, up from 12.38 million in September 2021. To put it in perspective, prior to COVID, SAAR had topped 17 million vehicles for five straight years from 2015 to 2019.While third-quarter vehicle sales of U.S. auto giants like General Motors and Ford increased year over year, Japanese counterparts Toyota and Honda witnessed sales decline. Italian-American automaker Stellantis — born out of the merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group — also reported a decline in its third-quarter sales volume, marking the fifth straight decline.While GM and TM carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and #5 (Strong Sell), respectively, STLA, F and HMC are Ranked #3 (Hold) currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.GM Top Selling U.S. Automaker, TM at the 2nd Spot in Q3U.S. legacy automaker General Motors’ total third-quarter U.S. sales increased 24.3% year over year to 555,580 vehicles. While Buick deliveries skid 27.4% year over year, sales of the other three brands — Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac — posted double-digit year-over-year percentage gains. Sales of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac jumped 29.5%, 23.9% and 49.5% respectively. Apart from the strong retail demand, General Motors’ fleet deliveries also soared 66% in the quarter.Story continuesGeneral Motors maintained its title as the top-selling carmaker in the United States in the third quarter of 2022. It managed to reclaim its U.S. sales crown in the second quarter after losing it to Toyota in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. Toyota had dethroned GM as the top-selling automaker of the nation in 2021 amid the chip crisis. That was the first time that a foreign automaker outsold a Detroit counterpart in U.S. auto sales for an entire calendar year in the industry’s 120-year history.Japan’s auto-titan Toyota sold 526,017 vehicles, down 7.1% year over year. However, September marked the company’s first monthly sales gain since July 2021. Last month, overall sales increased 17% year over year. However, while volumes of the namesake brand rose 21% in September, sales at the Lexus division declined 4.3%. With that, the Toyota brand snapped a 13-month losing streak, while the Lexus brand sales slid for the eighth consecutive month in September.GM’s close peer Ford’s third-quarter vehicle sales rose 16% year over year to 464,674 units. However, September was a rough month for the company. Last month, sales contracted 8.7% and 13% at the Ford and Lincoln divisions, respectively, ending three consecutive monthly gains at both brands. While models like Maverick, Bronco and Mustang Mach-E registered gains, other popular models like F-Series, Ranger, Explorer, Bronco Sport and Edge witnessed declines.Sales volumes at Stellantis dropped 6% year over year to 385,665 units. The automaker's biggest brand, Jeep, reported a decline of 18%. Volumes at RAM contracted 4%. Sales also tailed off at Fiat and Alfa Romeo brands. Meanwhile, Chrysler and Doge brands posted 39% and 22% sales increases, respectively.TM’s top peer Honda’s U.S. sales decreased 35.8% year over year to 222,050 vehicles during the quarter under review. While truck sales declined 28.8% to 157,549, car sales slumped 48.2% to 65,501 units. Sales were down 17.1% to 79,354 units in September. While sales at the namesake brand tumbled 18%, the Acura brand noted a 13% fall in volumes. With that, deliveries at the Honda division shrunk for 14 straight months, while at Acura, deliveries dwindled for 13 consecutive months.Other Japanese automakers like Nissan, Mazda and Mazda reported a sales decline of roughly 22%,13% and 3%, respectively.  Germany-based counterparts like BMW and Volkswagen held up relatively better, with U.S. sales volumes in the third quarter of 2022 increasing around 4% and 14%, respectively. Sales of South Korean automakers like Hyundai and Kia also rose year over year in the quarter under review.Inventory Is ImprovingThe first half of 2022 was a rough one for the U.S. auto market as parts shortage choked supplies and low stockpiles put the automakers on edge.Just when industry watchdogs and auto giants were predicting the chip deficit to gradually start easing out from mid-2022, the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered the second round of global microchip shortage. That forced automakers to yet again slash production plans and halt operations.So, while the demand for cars was still strong, supplies failed to keep pace with buyers’ appetite for new vehicles. Low inventory levels had been the key issue. September was on track to be the 16th straight month of retail inventory, closing below 1 million vehicles, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.But it seems like inventory is finally picking up, as supply chain snafus are gradually starting to ease. Per BofA Securities, the total automotive inventory rose to about 1.43 million units at the end of last month, the highest level since May 2021.GM exited the third quarter with a vehicle inventory of about 359,292 vehicles, an increase of 111,453 from the second quarter. The inventory also improved three times from that of third-quarter 2021 levels. Toyota ended the quarter with a 20-day supply of cars and light trucks (or 140,810 units) in the United States, implying a slight improvement from the 17-day supply at the end of the second quarter of 2022.  Ford’s gross inventory rose to 315,000 at September 2022 end, marking a sharp increase from 236,000 at the end of September 2021 and 259,000 at the end of August 2022.Affordability the New ConcernJust when new vehicles seem to be becoming more widely available, it’s to be seen if Americans wish to continue to splurge on these high-ticket items in the face of rising interest rates and recession worries. Since the auto industry is highly cyclical, the demand for vehicles is likely to cool off given the uncertain economic condition. The outlook for the rest of 2022 is getting increasingly cloudy.Chesbrough — a senior economist at Cox Automotive — said, “It seems likely that much of the pent-up demand from limited supply is quickly disappearing as high interest rates eat away at vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase."" Cox Chief economist Jonathan Smoke stated, “The irony for the auto market is that just as the industry is poised to start seeing volumes increase from supply-constrained recession-like low levels, the rapid movement in interest rates is reducing demand.”With inflation at levels not seen in decades, the Fed has been forced to become more aggressive, cranking up borrowing rates. On Sep 21, the Fed jacked up interest rates by 75 bps for the third time in a row. The rising interest rates will increase the financing costs of vehicles. With borrowing getting expensive and threats of a recession looming large, consumers might be unwilling to pay a heavy premium for cars.Per Cox, the new vehicle loan rate at the end of the third quarter was 7%, up 2 percentage points. The cost of financing is only expected to keep rising.Macro headwinds such as soaring interest rates, stubborn inflation and looming economic uncertainty have muted the prospects of the auto sector. In fact, largely due to the Fed’s ultra-hawkish stance, Cox slashed the full-year vehicle sales outlook to 13.7 million units, around 9% lower than 2021 levels.Average purchase prices for new cars rose 6.3% in September to more than $45,000, per J.D. Power. Aggressive rate hikes coupled with high sticker prices of cars is starting to test the affordability of customers. To purchase the same vehicle at the same monthly payment, buyers are now forced to increase their down payment, which is resulting in new affordability challenges. The demand may soften based on such macro challenges.It's yet to be seen if automakers resort to better incentives, sweeter financing deals and discounts to hold up the demand if customers get unwilling to shell more for these discretionary items. But that would reduce the profits of the auto biggies. So, either way, it’s a tough road for the automakers ahead.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

260,0013e0cd-8ccb-3d83-b866-bc1635281983,GM,2022-10-12,General Motors vs. Ford: Which Auto Stock Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-vs-ford-auto-233611139.html,1665531371,STORY,"['F', 'GM']","[The Automotive-Domestic Industry is in the top 36% of over 250 Zacks Industries and two stocks investors may consider buying out of the group are General Motors GM and Ford Motor Company F.The Auto sector is expected to experience solid growth with the emergence of electric vehicles (EVs) and Hybrids. General Motors and Ford both have impressive EV/Hybrid lineups which include Ford’s Mustang MACH-E and GM’s Electric Hummer.  Stock Performance The Automotive-Domestic Industry has been hit hard by rising inflation with GM and Ford both down about 44% year to date. Both stocks have also underperformed their peer group’s -36% drop and the S&amp;P 500’s -25%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking back a bit, Ford stock has climbed +53% over the last two years to blast GM’s +1% and its peer group’s -33% decline. Ford has also crushed the benchmark’s performance over the last two years as shown in the above chart, while GM has lagged.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith that being said, we can see that GM’s +31% jump over the last 10 years has outperformed Ford’s +15%. Both stocks have outperformed their peer group’s +8% over the last decade, but underperformed the benchmark. The gap between the benchmark could narrow going forward if Ford, GM and others are able to produce the kind of returns from the EV revolution that Wall Street hopes.ValuationLet’s take a look at the value both companies offer investors at current levels. Both stocks currently sport an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.GM shares currently trade at 4.8X forward earnings, well off their decade high of 22.8X and below the median of 7.2X.Ford also trades at what appears to be a discount relative to its past at 5.6X forward earnings. This is well below its decade-long high of 16.5X and 7.8X median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the price of Ford shares at $11.56 is still significantly lower than General Motors’ $32.09 per share, GM appears to offer more value relative to its past as it trades further from its highs.Story continuesGrowth Estimates Ford and General Motors are both set to profit from the innovation and transformation of the auto industry. The EV market is projected to be valued at upwards of $500 billion by 2030 while growing at a CAGR of over 20%.GM earnings are expected to be down 5% this year and decline another 4% in FY23 at $6.42 a share. Ford appears to be dealing with the effects of rising operating costs much better than GM at the moment, with earnings expected to be up 26% this year and virtually flat in FY23 at $2.00 a share.GM’s earnings decline is an indicator that operating costs are weighing on the stock as sales are expected to grow 21% this year and another 6% in FY23 to $163.72 billion. Ford is also expected to have solid top line growth, with 2022 sales set to rise 14% and another 3% in FY23 to $149.75 billion.Ford’s growth in both its top and bottom line over the next year indicates the stock may be the better option for the near term.DividendsStocks that pay dividends are always an added bonus for investors, especially in times of uncertainty when more patience is needed.Ford and General Motors both offer dividends to their shareholders again after suspending them during the pandemic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFord has a notably higher annual dividend yield of 5.28% at $0.60 a share compared to GM’s 1.11% yield at $0.36 a share.With the pandemic throwing a wrench in how the two companies may pay dividends going forward, it is important to note that GM has not raised its dividend in the last five years while Ford has raised its dividend twice.Bottom LineFor now, Ford appears to be the better stock at least for the short term. GM currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with its earnings estimate revisions trending down. Ford on the other hand is seeing some growth in its top and bottom line for this year and FY23. Ford currently lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) and also offers investors a higher dividend yield at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GM said the nickel laterite ore is expected to be processed using a new, proprietary process that helps reduce waste.Under a law passed in August, automakers must source battery minerals from countries with free trade agreements in order to qualify for the U.S. consumer EV tax credits.The GM investment is to assist in the development of its proposed Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub (TECH) Project in Northern Australia. High-grade nickel laterite ore will be imported from nearby New Caledonia, GM said.GM already has binding agreements securing all battery raw material supporting its goal of 1 million units of annual capacity in North America by the end of 2025.GM said the ""new collaboration builds on those commitments as we look to secure supply through the end of the decade, while also helping continue to expand the EV market.""Queensland Pacific Metals CEO Stephen Grocott said ""GM’s investment in our company and the associated offtake brings us one step closer towards construction of the TECH Project.""In August, GM said it was prepaying Livent Corp $198 million for a guaranteed six-year supply of lithium, a deal that reflects the auto industry's rising worry about a tightening market for the electric vehicle battery metal.Prepaying cash for a guaranteed metal supply is unusual in the mining industry.

They said on Tuesday they are initially committing to investing $3.5 billion and creating 2,200 jobs but said the overall investment is projected to reach $4.4 billion.Honda will separately invest $700 million to retool three Ohio plants and add 300 new jobs, as it seeks higher electric- vehicle production.Honda will produce battery cases at its Anna, Ohio, engine plant that will be combined with battery modules from the JV and then installed in EVs built at two other Ohio plants.The plant is the latest in a string of battery plants announced as automakers race to shift gas-powered production to electric vehicles.The U.S. Congress in August approved billions of dollars in tax incentives and grants for automakers to encourage increased production of EVs and batteries in the United States. It also approved new consumer tax credits to incentivize North American battery and EV production.President Joe Biden praised the Honda-LG announcement, saying the companies were ""committing more than $5 billion toward electric vehicle battery manufacturing and factory retooling across the state.""

UAL also has a decent surprise history, with its earnings having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters (missing the mark in the other two quarters), the average beat being 10.53%.United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-eps-surprise | United Airlines Holdings Inc QuoteAgainst this backdrop, let’s see how things are shaping up for United Airlines this earnings season.We expect upbeat air-travel demand following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions to have aided United Airlines’ top-line performance in the September quarter. Owing to upbeat passenger volume, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have increased significantly from the year-ago quarter’s reading.The presence of the Labor Day holiday period during the quarter is likely to have boosted the air traffic further. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated airline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, indicates a 39.3% increase from the year-earlier level. Buoyed by high traffic, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 consolidated load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) is currently pegged at 85, implying growth from the year-ago actual figure of 76.However, high fuel costs per gallon are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the third quarter. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.83 in the third quarter, suggesting a rise from the figure reported in third-quarter 2021.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive  Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here as you can see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesUAL has an Earnings ESP of +5.29% (the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.21, 11 cents below the Most Accurate Estimate) and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q2United Airlines’ second-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 43 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.43 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. Escalated operating expenses induced the earnings miss. Consequently, shares declined in after-hours trading on Jul 20. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $3.91 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The second quarter of 2022 was the first profitable period at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks worth considering from the broader Zacks  Transportation  sector, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings for third-quarter 2022:Canadian National Railway Company CNI has an Earnings ESP of +0.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.

These three new nonstops have been scheduled to fly from Dec 14, 2022, to Feb 8, 2023, marking 10 weekly UAL nonstops between Sydney and San Francisco.

With strong demand for the upcoming northern winter season, we’re proud to add even more travel options for our customers, both in the U.S. and in Australia.”Apart from Australia, UAL is also looking forward to flying smoothly to more Asian countries.

While the company’s earnings are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year decline, its revenues are likely to have increased.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on net interest income (NII) growth. However, higher expenses and a decline in fee income affected the results.Notably, PNC Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 8.3%, on average.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteThe company’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $3.71 has moved marginally downward in the past week, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. The figure indicates a 1.1% decline from the year-ago reported number.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.4 billion, suggesting 3.8% year-over-year growth. Management expects the top line to be up 4-6% sequentially.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s third-quarter performance.NII: Per the Fed’s latest data, loan growth continued at a decent pace in the to-be-reported quarter, with commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderating in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the third quarter. This is likely to have supported PNC’s loan balances, comprising 68% of commercial loans. The company expects average loans to rise 1-2% sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $499.8 billion for the quarter indicates a 2.3% sequential rise. This is expected to have aided NII growth in the quarter.Story continuesFurther, the Federal Reserve continued increasing interest rates in the quarter to tame inflation. It raised interest rates by 150 basis points in the quarter, resulting in a policy rate of 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. This is likely to have had a favorable impact on the bank’s asset yield, net interest margin (NIM) and NII. However, the inversion of the yield curve in the September-ended quarter is expected to have weighed on NIM to some extent.Management anticipates NII to grow 10-12% sequentially. Also, the consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $3.4 billion, suggesting an 11.2% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Non-Interest Revenues: Heightening volatility, uncertainty, recession fears and geopolitical tensions dampened the equity market performance. Thus, asset management and brokerage fee revenues are anticipated to have been negatively impacted.Due to weak markets and global economic uncertainty, deal-making activity and IPOs reduced in third-quarter 2022. Given the capital market disruptions, the company’s capital market-related revenues are likely to have been negatively impacted.Deposits slowed down in the quarter, likely due to a decrease in government aid and consumer savings. Also, in the quarter, PNC removed non-sufficient fund fees from all consumer deposit accounts. These are expected to have led to lower revenues from service charges on deposits.Mortgage rates increased sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossing the 6% mark in September. Also, mortgage origination activities are estimated to have decreased drastically, with the rising rates affecting refinancing activity. Thus, the factors are expected to have hurt PNC Financial’s residential mortgage revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is pegged at $1.98 billion, suggesting a 3.7% decrease sequentially. Management expects fee income to fall 3-5% sequentially.Expenses: Overall, technology investments and general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs, while wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses. Hence, the rise in cost base from such expenses is likely to have impeded bottom-line growth. Management expects non-interest expenses to be stable to up 1%.What the Zacks Model RevealsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for PNC Financial this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is -1.92%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookBankUnited BKU and M&amp;T Bank MTB are a few stocks that you might want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model.The Earnings ESP for BKU is +1.32% and the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

276,c53d25e5-e941-3be1-8a0b-df4afa8e956e,PNC,2022-10-12,Earnings Preview: Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-truist-financial-corporation-140002730.html,1665496802,STORY,['TFC-PR'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.92 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Truist Financial Corporation?For Truist Financial Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Truist Financial Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Truist Financial Corporation would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of +2.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Truist Financial Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.71 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -1.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.4 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 1.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.92%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

277,32efe394-101a-396a-bec1-2b0ca5ce8c57,PNC,2022-10-12,The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in Physical Security,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/importance-diversity-inclusion-physical-security-132500216.html,1665494700,STORY,['PNC'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 11, 2022 / PNC Financial Services GroupPNC Financial Services Group, Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release picturePNC's efforts in diversity and inclusion comprises of and extends across its entire employee base. Its physical security team is a microcosm of the bank's demonstrated success in that endeavor.Every quarter PNC's Enterprise Technology and Security (ET&amp;S) team hosts a discussion on important topics and trends that drive the security space in the workforce. Most recently, the series included a keynote speaker from the nation's highest domestic information and security service organization, the FBI, along with a panel of PNC employees in the bank's physical security team, to discuss diversity and inclusion in the physical security space. Their experiences served as prime examples of why diversity and inclusion are essential to the field, and how women can enter and thrive in the profession.""PNC strongly focuses on gender equality, diversity and inclusion and employee development, which has led to the advancement of a number of inspiring women leaders in the ET&amp;S team,"" said Deborah Guild, Head of PNC Enterprise Technology and Security. ""This topic in particular was certainly one that hit close to home for many of our teammates, myself included. Diverse teams and diversity of thought are extremely important to PNC's overall success. Our people in physical security highlight that.""The event's keynote speaker was Jennifer Moore, the executive assistant director of the Human Resources Branch for the FBI, a seasoned bureau employee with 23 years' experience and advice. She painted a picture of her career challenges, but also her unconventional background that could serve as inspiration to others.An Unconventional Path and a Supportive OrganizationMoore didn't have a background related to security when she joined the FBI. However, she credits the organization's emphasis on supporting, promoting and training women for her successful career in the field.Story continuesAfter a stint in marketing, her FBI career began when she was offered a receptionist position in the San Diego field office, eventually working her way up into a management position.However, after a post-September 11 reorganization, and a slight oversight, Moore found herself without a defined role. Her supervisors then offered her a job that she was initially reluctant to take. After a few more nudges from her bosses, though, she became the first security officer in the Dallas field. She was tasked with keeping facilities, employees and information secure from both internal and external threats.""I fell in love with the world of security,"" she said. ""Keeping your organization secure in those aspects is essential to its success and ability to not only survive but thrive. Every day that you don't hear about a breach of our building, or a spill of information, that's a success. I love the impact it has made on my life and career.""Her career trajectory, according to Moore, also reflects how different the FBI looks today than it did just five decades ago. She mentioned that specific timeline for good reason.In 2022, the bureau is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its first two women special agents.""We're fortunate to have women serving at the highest level of our organization now, here in the U.S. and around the world,"" said Moore. ""Women make up 45% of the FBI's workforce, nearly 25% of our executives are women, and nearly a quarter of our special agents are women. As an organization, you have to bring in the right mix of perspectives and backgrounds to the table. That's not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it brings in a wide array of ideas that are key to building trust and credibility. It allows us to reflect the communities we serve.""PNC Panelists Reflect on Opportunities, ChallengesMoore's keynote address was followed by a panel of PNC employees who work in various roles within the bank's physical security team.""PNC has so many women on the team that help support and protect our organization,"" said Tammy Janero, PNC Head of Enterprise Event Management for Physical Security, who moderated the panel. ""Like Jennifer Moore, some of these women did not previously have backgrounds in law enforcement. I certainly didn't either. I had a marketing background. PNC's emphasis on diversity and inclusion and employee development gave us that environment to succeed in this field.""There are still inherent challenges women face in a male-dominated field, according to panelist Patricia Crissien, PNC Market Operations Manager. Still, there are concrete solutions that can be taken to help clear those hurdles.""My primary job is to mitigate risk, and that provides me with the privilege to work with several amazing physical security partners,"" she said. ""As amazing as they are, they're all male. It's important for women to continue to promote a workplace that encourages other women to enter this field. We need to ensure that we have strong leadership development and mentoring programs in place. We also need to embolden women to own their own employee development plans. They can create a roadmap for themselves to succeed, and I think PNC does a great job of helping its employees do that.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719860/The-Importance-of-Diversity-and-Inclusion-in-Physical-Security]"
278,21c7f0c6-0afe-3665-b422-accb206a988d,PNW,2022-10-12,Earnings growth of 0.9% over 3 years hasn't been enough to translate into positive returns for Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-growth-0-9-over-180751357.html,1665511671,STORY,['PNW'],"[Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) shareholders, since the share price is down 35% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 28%. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 21% in thirty days. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 11% in the same time period.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. Check out our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Although the share price is down over three years, Pinnacle West Capital actually managed to grow EPS by 2.7% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It looks to us like the market was probably too optimistic around growth three years ago. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. We like that Pinnacle West Capital has actually grown its revenue over the last three years. But it's not clear to us why the share price is down. It might be worth diving deeper into the fundamentals, lest an opportunity goes begging.Story continuesThe company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPinnacle West Capital is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Pinnacle West Capital in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Pinnacle West Capital, it has a TSR of -27% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Pinnacle West Capital shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 4.9% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it's worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Pinnacle West Capital better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Pinnacle West Capital (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$242 and falling to the lows of US$186. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$186 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What Is Intuitive Surgical Worth?Great news for investors – Intuitive Surgical is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $252.51, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Intuitive Surgical’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 61% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuitive Surgical. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ISRG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ISRG.

This company, which is in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This freight railroad has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.51%.For the most recent quarter, CSX was expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share, but it reported $0.50 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.38%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.38 per share, while it actually produced $0.39 per share, a surprise of 2.63%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for CSX. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.CSX currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 20, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

An 18% gratuity is automatically added for drinks ordered a la carte, and the Royal Caribbean blog says that domestic beers cost $7.49 and $7.99 for imports, while Red Stripe costs $8.25, and ""many wines by the glass are still around $10-14 per glass.""Continue reading]"

(NYSE:RCL) share price has gained 23% in the last three months. But that can't change the reality that over the longer term (five years), the returns have been really quite dismal. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 68% during that time. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. We'd err towards caution given the long term under-performance.While the last five years has been tough for Royal Caribbean Cruises shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. See our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises Royal Caribbean Cruises isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over half a decade Royal Caribbean Cruises reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 28% for each year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 11% (annualized) in the same time period. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and don't grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity. This looks like a really risky stock to buy, at a glance.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Royal Caribbean Cruises will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Royal Caribbean Cruises' total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Royal Caribbean Cruises' TSR of was a loss of 66% for the 5 years. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Royal Caribbean Cruises shareholders did even worse, losing 53%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Royal Caribbean Cruises is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

295,bbf31fe7-960f-30d3-9180-6bbe779d6d2f,MAR,2022-10-12,Alternatives ETFs Offer Bright Spots in Tough Market,ETF.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alternatives-etfs-offer-bright-spots-181500664.html,1665512100,STORY,"['VITSX', 'VSMPX', 'VSTSX', 'VTI', 'VTSAX', 'VTSMX', 'KMLM', 'PFIX', 'DBMF']","[Alternatives exchange-traded funds are doing largely what they are supposed to—and then some.These ETFs are diversifying investors’ portfolios this year. They are also handily beating the performance of mainstream rivals. All but three of the nearly 50 U.S.-listed alternatives ETFs have outperformed the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) this year, often by wide margins. Most broad asset classes have declined steeply in value this year. For example, VTI is down nearly 24% year to date as rising interest rates, inflation and war batter global equity markets. Alternative investments—things like hedge funds, commodities, options strategies and private equity—have largely been overlooked. Hedge funds and private equity funds typically require big upfront payments, while investing in options and commodities may be more complex for those who aren’t professionals U.S.-listed ETFs have pulled in roughly $425 billion year to date, but only $2.3 billion of that has flowed into the alternatives category, according to ETF.com data. This is despite top-performing alternatives ETFs notching returns as high as 80%. Investors are potentially missing out.Top PerformersThe $350.4 million Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) tops the alternatives category with a gain of nearly 81% so far this year. The actively managed fund is designed to hedge against increases in long-term interest rates through a portfolio of over-the-counter interest rate options.The fund performed unremarkably after it launched in May 2021 as there was nothing to hedge. Once the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March, PFIX took off. With the Fed appearing to likely to push ahead with further interest rate hikes, the fund may still have fuel in the tank. KraneShares, known for its ETFs that focus on China’s markets, also issues funds with alternative exposures through its KFA Funds white label unit. The $284.6 million KFA Mount Lucas Index Strategy ETF (KMLM) offers an index-based long/short managed futures strategy that provides exposure to the performance of futures contracts on 11 commodities, six currencies and five global bond markets. The individual contracts are equally weighted within their respective categories, with weights assigned to each of the three categories based on relative historical volatility.Story continuesKMLM has returned 46% so far this year, crushing the S&amp;P 500’s decline. The fund has been boosted by exposure to commodities and currencies, while the global bond market’s struggles have prevented gains as high as PFIX’s. KMLM began its passively managed strategy April 1, and the switch from an active long/short managed futures strategy has helped it beat the equity markets. Currently, its portfolio has short positions in six commodities futures and has short positions in all its currency and fixed income exposures. The $944.4 million iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy ETF (DBMF) is a long/short managed futures ETF that implements an active strategy seeking to mimic the performance of the largest commodity trading advisor hedge funds. The fund is up nearly 32% year to date. Like KMLM, the futures contracts it holds represent a variety of commodities and currencies, though its portfolio currently also includes futures on global equities and domestic fixed income securities. As of yesterday, it was short everything but S&amp;P 500 futures.Final ThoughtsWith markets in turmoil, safe havens are hard to find. Adding to the global miseries, the International Monetary Fund, in its new outlook for next year, is predicting the weakest global growth since 2001. The “worst is yet to come,” IMF said.Now may be the time for investors to look beyond traditional asset classes in hopes of some return.  Contact Heather Bell at heather.bell@etf.comRecommended StoriesOdds &amp; Ends: Harbor Capital Debuts 10th ETF Odds &amp; Ends: More iPath ETNs Resume CreationsUntangling Barclays’ ETN Mess Hot Reads: Crypto Lost $1T In 6 MonthsPermalink | © Copyright 2022 ETF.com.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis of the hotel industry, and go directly to the 5 Best Hotel Stocks To Buy Now.The hotel industry is a branch of the hospitality sector that focuses on offering lodging services to clients. According to Statista, the global market for hotels and resorts reached its peak in 2019 at $1.52 trillion. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused the market size to fall under $1 trillion in 2020 and 2021. The market was anticipated to be worth $1.06 trillion in 2022. According to Deloitte, there is an indication that some consumers are still adjusting to COVID while there has been a welcome uptick in activity across the industry. Consumers are also highly concerned about inflation and the cost of living, but these worries have not yet had a significant impact on their intentions to spend money on travel.According to CBRE, inbound tourism will increase hotel demand in 2022 in the U.S., driven primarily by leisure travelers from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2022, resorts and all-inclusive vacation spots will continue to do well as travelers look for simplicity and price stability. The advantages won't all be the same. Miami has benefited from the change in travel habits and is already doing 13% better than 2019's summer revenue per available room (RevPAR). Greater benefits may accrue in 2022 for harder-hit markets like San Francisco and New York, where RevPAR is still down 61% and 56%, respectively, from 2019. Given rising construction costs and manpower scarcity, supply growth will generally continue to be low.For the Hotel sector in the U.S., PWC foresees a more robust Q4. According to Warren Marr, US Hospitality &amp; Leisure Managing Director at PWC:“Despite volatility in the financial markets and heightened concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we now expect US hotels to surpass 2019 RevPAR levels this year, driven by strong growth in room rates stemming from focused revenue management strategies of operators.”Story continuesSmart money is certainly invested in the hospitality industry, and companies like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) are some of the best hotel stocks that are very popular among hedge funds.12 Best Hotel Stocks To Buy NowZvonimir Atletic/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyLet’s dive into the 12 best hotel stocks to buy now.

Southeastern Asset Management is the leading shareholder of the company, with 2.89 million shares worth $213.89 million.On September 27, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) was upgraded by Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth from In Line to Outperform with a $100 price target. According to Pfennigwerth, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) shift to asset-light fee-based revenue would gradually increase the creation of free cash flow. Pfennigwerth believes that the asset-light hotel brands are generally appealing despite their recent downturn, but Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) has a higher long-term re-rating potential than the other brands in the group.Baron Funds discussed Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) in the second quarter investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) declined 22.6% and hurt performance by 149 bps in the quarter on investor concerns that a possible recession will result in growth rates that would slow or even turn negative, and the company is currently generating peak profits. Thus far, the company has seen no material slowdown in occupancy levels or rates and continues to increase prices, especially on the leisure side. While leisure may be experiencing peak demand levels, management believes any slowdown in growth should be offset by the continued recovery of group and business customers.Volumes in these segments are rapidly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This should lead to higher margins as group and business travel spending is higher than leisure spending. The company’s anticipated strong free cash flow, coupled with cash proceeds from owned asset sales, can be used to repay debt incurred to complete its acquisition of Apple Leisure Group. Hyatt’s balance sheet is strong, and it has recently re-initiated its stock buyback program. Hyatt’s robust balance sheet and cash flow profile combined with additional asset sales should also result in more consistent earnings that could result in multiple expansion.”06.

""We only had 30 minutes to spare,"" recalls Nino. At that moment, Gonzales remembered advice he'd heard in the Selling Your Story course at Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. ""This is a great moment to capture on social media,"" he thought. ""People want to buy from a human, they want to make that connection,"" Nino adds. So Gonzales took a video, posted it to Instagram and wrote, ""Oh, no, look at this.""For Gonzales and Nino, recovering from small mistakes and running from event to event is all in a day's work. On a recent Saturday, they delivered handcrafted charcuterie boards to a wedding reception, a tasting workshop and even to a private jet for on-flight snacking. ""Our boards have at least nine different types of charcuterie meats and three staple cheeses,"" says Nino. And those boards, in addition to their grazing tables, culinary classes, wine and gift boxes, have found a wide audience.But when the pandemic brought an unexpected shift to their original, brick-and-mortar business model-and an uptick in demand for shipping- the couple found themselves without a clear route ahead. ""There's been no roadmap for our business,"" Gonzales says. Seeking inspiration, the couple discovered Verizon Small Business Digital Ready through their local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The free online portal, offering courses, live coaching, and networking, was just the help they needed to adapt. ""These courses are like drinking from the fire hose - in the best way,"" says Gonzales.Scaling upThrough the Track Your Finances and Get Beyond Break Even courses, Nino and Gonzales learned the importance of upgrading their financial management. Before, they relied on a bank account to track their losses and profit. ""Now we have integrated new accounting software. It's more professional and honed in where our most profitable margins may be,"" Gonzales says.Story continuesThey also hired an outside bookkeeper to help them make savvy, cost-effective purchases.""We're trying to curate the boards and keep costs at bay, especially right now,"" Gonzales says. At the same time, Verizon Small Business Digital Ready inspired them to look at financial statements and figure out ways to scale.Nino says she appreciated the ""bite-size"" pieces of guidance on SEO and ways to connect authentically on social media. Hence, they turned their sidewalk stumble into a win. That open attitude has helped grow their social media following to 5,000-plus people.Date night re-imaginedIn 2018, Nino and Gonzales kept coming up against the same argument: what to make for dinner. The couple solved the problem by creating their own charcuterie boards at home. After posting them on social media, a business idea was born.Initially focused on a restaurant model, the couple quickly shifted to building their online presence after the pandemic hit. They made other pivots, including breaking down a full board into ""lunchables for adults,"" catering, workshops and shipping nationally.Discovering superpowersFast forward to now, the course Selling with Storytelling: Unlock Your Business Superpower prompted the couple to look within and consider the thing they do uniquely well. ""Shipping food was one superpower we unlocked that we didn't know was possible,"" Gonzales says, as the couple eyes an even bigger national reach. ""The course inspired us to figure out what our next superpower will be.""Verizon Small Business Digital Ready provides free personalized courses, live coaching, networking, planning aids, and grant opportunities for eligible small businesses.

It exacerbates natural disasters, threatens supply chains and disproportionately harms marginalized communities, contributing to socio- economic inequalities. Tapestry and our brands are responding to the urgent call for collective action and doing our part to mitigate climate-related risks to our business, our people and the communities where we live and work.We are aligning our business strategies with the international consensus - outlined in the Paris Agreement - that we must limit global warming to below 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. In early FY2022, we signed onto the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C.Read more about our management of climate- related risks and opportunities in our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONSWe aim to reduce our GHG emissions as part of our efforts to address climate change. In 2019, Tapestry set goals to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 20% below 2017 levels and reduce Scope 3 emissions from freight shipping 20% below 2017 levels, both by 2025. As of FY2021, we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 6% and Scope 3 emissions from upstream freight shipping by 28%. We are currently working on setting increased targets for Scope 3 emissions and are expanding our Scope 3 emissions inventory to likely include upstream and downstream transportation, business travel, emissions from purchased goods and services, and other relevant categories as outlined by the GHG protocol.Tapestry's emissions across Scope 2 and 3 increased from FY2020 to FY2021 as our business activities started to return to normal following the initial impacts of COVID-19. As we work towards achieving our GHG emissions reduction goals and a net-zero value chain, we know it will take the full participation of our business, our brands and our supply chain partners. In FY2022, we aim to host trainings for our suppliers on establishing GHG emissions reduction goals in line with SBTi for their operations.Story continuesENERGY AND RENEWABLESTapestry is committed to procuring 100% renewable electricity in our stores, offices and fulfillment centers by 2025. We work with a third-party energy procurement team to source renewable energy in our retail stores in deregulated electricity markets using green-e certified renewable energy credits (RECs). In FY2021, our RECs covered 21% of our electricity consumption across our operations in North America, which is equivalent to 9% renewable electricity globally. Our total REC purchases from 2017 to 2021 were 20,522 MWH.In addition to purchasing renewable energy, we are working to improve energy efficiency and reduce overall electricity usage wherever possible. Our global headquarters at Hudson Yards is LEED Platinum certified and our kate spade new york office and Jacksonville distribution center both earned LEED Silver certifications.Renewable Energy in Our Supply ChainWe seek to promote renewable energy consumption across our supply chain. 78% of our suppliers who completed the Higg FEM energy module and had their data verified by a third-party agency achieved a Level 1 rating in the Energy and GHG module, and 22% achieved a Level 2 rating.8 The data provided through the Higg FEM, combined with data we received from tanneries audited by the LWG, allowed us to analyze our supply chain energy consumption data broken down by source and usage and provided us with a baseline to measure our supply chain improvements year-over-year.In early FY2022, we began engaging with our suppliers one-on-one to help set energy reduction targets and increase adoption of renewable energy. As we work to set a science-based target, we plan to include additional Scope 3 categories in our GHG footprint and plan to report on that information in future reports.Read more about Higg FEM and our work to help suppliers improve environmental performance in the Engaging Our Suppliers section of this report.Read moreTapestry, Inc., Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.tapestry.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719946/Tapestrys-Approach-to-Climate-Change]"

CHS as the Bull of the Day and Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Chesapeake Energy CHK, EQT Corporation EQT and Cheniere Energy LNG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Chico's FAS, Inc. still has momentum from the pandemic as women are shopping for apparel for experiences, like weddings, and back-to-work. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings growth this year and next.Chico's FAS is a fashion company with three distinct brands for women: Chico's, White House Black Market and Soma. It sells clothing, shoes, accessories and intimate apparel through brick-and-mortar boutiques, digital online boutiques and through StyleConnect, the company's customized, branded, digital styling tool.As of July 30, 2022, it operated 1,258 stores in the US and sold merchandise through 58 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. Chico's FAS also operates the websites at chicos.com, chicosofftherack.com, whbm.com and soma.com.A Record Fiscal Second QuarterOn Aug 31, Chico's FAS reported its fiscal second quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.09. Earnings were $0.34 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $0.25. It was the fourth beat in a row.It was also a record second quarter with comparable sales jumping 19.5%. White House Black Market was up 32%, Chico's was up 30% but Soma fell 9% as consumers pulled back on lounge and cozy on the economic re-opening. You aren't wearing sweatpants to a wedding.However, all three brands are up over the same quarter in 2019, which was pre-pandemic.The quarter was also boosted by the company's new loyalty program which Chico's FAS said was being embraced by customers. Loyalty programs work.Story continuesGross margins rose 300 basis points to 41.4% year-over-year on fewer promotions.However, inventories jumped year-over-year to $338.8 million from $202.1 million last year thanks to elevated in-transit inventories. On-hand inventories were also up, jumping 25%, but that was due to high consumer demand and the intent to meet that demand.Will inventories be a problem heading into the holiday season? Keep an eye on the promotions.Full Year Earnings Estimates JumpChico's is a small cap retailer with a market cap of just $624 million. It has little coverage on the Street. Zacks.com only has one earnings estimate for this year and next but that analyst is bullish.Third quarter guidance wasn't doom and gloom even though the gross margin forecast did come down to a range of 38.9% to 39.4%.The Zacks Consensus for fiscal 2022 has risen to $0.85 from $0.72 in the last 2 months. That's earnings growth of 113% from fiscal 2021 as the company only made $0.40 that year.The analyst is also bullish about next year, seeing another 11.8% earnings growth for fiscal 2023.Shares are Dirt CheapLike other retail stocks, Chico's FAS shares came storming out of the gate during the pandemic rebound in 2020 and 2021. Over the last 2 years, shares are up 326%.But this year, shares have slipped 7.3% on the year. However, they are mostly holding onto a narrow trading range above their pre-pandemic level.Chico's FAS is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.8.The question is what will happen this holiday season. Who can keep promotions to a minimum? Who will be on trend? Holiday parties will return but will women be buying new outfits?Chico's FAS has kept its recent momentum, which is impressive in the competitive apparel category.For investors looking for a cheap retail stock with a strong outlook, Chico's FAS is one to keep on the short list.Bear of the Day:Stanley Black &amp; Decker is in the midst of a business transformation while it also has to fight inflationary pressures. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see an earnings decline of 47% this year.Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the world's largest tool company with nearly 50 manufacturing facilities in the United States and more than 100 worldwide.It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners and other industrial equipment. It's iconic brands include DEWALT, BLACK+DECKER, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY, CUB CADET, HUSTLER AND TROY-BILT.First Earnings Miss in 5 Years in the Second QuarterOn July 28, 2022, Stanley Black &amp; Decker reported its second quarter earnings and saw its first earnings miss in 5 years.Earnings were $1.77 versus the Zacks Consensus of $2.12, or a miss of $0.35.Revenue was actually up 16% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, driven by strategic outdoor power equipment acquisitions, which were up 24%, and price realization, which added 7%. This was partially offset by lower volume, which fell 13%, and currency, which was down 2%.Tools and Outdoor demand softened during the last portion of the quarter which caused the company to spring into action. It's expecting demand to normalize closer to 2019 in the back half of 2022. As a result, it's reducing inventory and cutting costs. In addition to dealing with inflationary pressures and softening demand, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is also in a transition with its business. It sold Stanley Security and Access Technologies in July 2022. It also reached an agreement to sell its Oil &amp; Gas business.The company has repurchased $2.3 billion in shares in 2022 with proceeds from the divestitures and is sitting on a bunch of cash.Raised Its DividendOn July 20, 2022, Stanley Black &amp; Decker approved a $0.01 increase of its quarterly cash dividend to $0.80 per share for the third quarter.This was the 55th consecutive annual dividend increase for the company. The dividend is currently yielding a juicy 4.1%.Earnings Estimates SlashedAfter the talk of reducing inventories in July, the analysts turned bearish. 3 estimates were slashed for both 2022 and 2023 in the last 60 days.The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $5.53 from $6.71 in the last 2 months. That's an earnings decline of 47.2% as the company made $10.48 last year.2023 is expected to bounce back by 24%, to $6.85, but even 2023 has come down from just a few months ago.Are Shares Cheap?It shouldn't be a surprise that Stanley Black &amp; Decker shares have taken a hit this year. Shares are down 59% year-to-date.But they're also near 5-year lows and are down 51% during that time, when the S&amp;P 500 is up 41% for the same period.Is the stock cheap?Stanley Black &amp; Decker trades with a forward P/E of 14, even after the earnings were cut. That's cheap but it's not dirt cheap.The company is expected to report third quarter earnings on Oct 27, 2022. Investors interested in this tool maker might want to stay on the sidelines until there is more clarity on what is happening in the business.Additional content:3 Natural Gas Names to Get Through Near-Term UncertaintyThe U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures fell for the seventh week in a row.At the same time, there appears to be plenty of upside left for the commodity in 2022, supported by a strong liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export trend and solid fundamentals. In this context, it would be wise to build a position in quality names such as Chesapeake Energy, EQT Corporation and Cheniere Energy.EIA Reports a Build Larger Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 129 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 30, exceeding the guidance of a 114 Bcf addition per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The increase was also above last year’s injection of 114 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net build of 87 Bcf.The latest increment puts total natural gas stocks at 3,106 Bcf, which is still 165 Bcf (5%) below the 2021 level at this time and 264 Bcf (7.8%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 106.5 Bcf per day, up 0.8 Bcf per day on a weekly basis as dry production jumped to a new record of 100.3 Bcf per day.Meanwhile, daily consumption fell 1.4% to 89.7 Bcf from 91 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a weaker power burn, with the cooling demand season coming to a finish.Natural Gas Registers a Marginal Weekly DecreaseNatural gas prices edged down last week, following the higher-than-expected inventory build. Futures for November delivery ended Friday at $6.748 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 0.3% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the seventh straight week — is also the result of a boom in supplies and the prediction of mild autumn weather.Final ThoughtsAs is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate light temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with little use of air conditioning or heater across much of the Lower 48), which is a negative for prices.An increase in natural gas production has also kept the commodity in check. With the upstream operators finally responding to price incentives and ramping up volumes in the last two months, daily production has topped 100 Bcf in recent weeks. This wave of new supply is expected to largely neutralize concerns that the market might enter the winter withdrawal season with gas in storage well below normal. Current inventories are still low and remain nearly 8% below their five-year average.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe squeezed following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out most of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart in November. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Investing StrategyWhile fundamental indicators continue to suggest strong price levels, the natural gas market is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden rise in production and mild weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Chesapeake Energy, EQT and Cheniere Energy. Chesapeake Energy has a premier natural gas portfolio with more than 15 years of inventory spread over some 2,200 locations. CHK — valued at some $12.1 billion — has a projected earnings growth rate of 95.4% for the current quarter.  Chesapeake Energy beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 24.5%, on average. CHK shares have rallied 60.2% in a year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with a primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of 369.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EQT’s 2022 earnings has been revised 14% upward over the past 60 days. EQT — valued at around $16 billion — has soared 117% in a year.Cheniere Energy is valued at around $43.5 billion. LNG reported EPS of $2.90 for the second quarter, reflecting a 2.5% surprise over consensus.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 235.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #2 Ranked natural gas exporter’s third-quarter earnings has been revised 42.7% upward over the past 60 days. LNG shares have climbed 71.2% in a year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming chip demand, ongoing supply-chain issues are also hurting data center chip market.The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues. Trade war between the US and China also remains a key concern.However, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Pfizer's shares have gained +0.6% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +5.6%. The company is strongly placed in the COVID vaccines/treatment market right now. Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022.Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth. However, currency headwinds and pricing pressure are key top-line headwinds. Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID-related products due to competitive pressure.Story continuesOur estimates for Pfizer’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 30% over the next three years.

The elimination of overdraft fees will impede fee income growth in the near term.However, Citigroup’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters. It is progressing with its strategy to exit the global consumer banking business. With this, it will focus on institutional franchises, thereby improving long-term profitability.The bank also intends to wind down its UK retail banking business, and expand personal banking and wealth management businesses in the region.

NVRO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid foothold in the Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) market. A solid second-quarter 2022 performance, along with continued strength in its flagship Senza platform, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and dependence on third-party payors persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 68.4% compared with the 33.9% decline of the industry and 18% fall of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $1.29 billion. The company projects 23.1% growth for 2022 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Nevro’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in one and broke even in the other, the average earnings surprise being 5.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Solid Foothold in SCS Market: Nevro’s foothold in the global SCS therapy business raises our optimism about the stock. This month, the company announced that the FDA had approved its manufacturing operations in Costa Rica for the production of its proprietary SCS systems for treating chronic pain, including its HFX product platform.The same month, Nevro announced that its HFX 10 kHz Therapy is the only form of SCS therapy to be referenced by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology in its 2022 Diabetes Clinical Practice Guideline to treat painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN).Strength in Senza: We are optimistic about Nevro’s continued strength in its flagship Senza platform. Based on analysis from the company’s SENZA- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and European studies, as well as the SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP (non-surgical refractory back pain) RCTs, Nevro believes the 10 kHz therapy can be an attractive treatment option for patients. Due to the removal of paresthesia, the company believes that the 10 kHz therapy can also be effective for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Nevro’s better-than-expected second-quarter 2022 earnings buoy optimism. The company recorded an improvement in overall top line and robust domestic revenues. The uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures, along with sequential improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures, were also seen. The expansion of the gross margin also bodes well.DownsidesDependence on Third-Party Payors: Nevro’s success in marketing its products largely depends on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of its products. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for SCS procedures using Senza by third-party payors is essential for the acceptance of Nevro’s products by its customers.Stiff Competition: Nevro operates in a highly competitive medical device industry, which is subject to technological change. The company’s success depends partly upon its ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of its HF10 therapy and Senza products for the treatment of approved chronic pain conditions.Estimate TrendNevro is witnessing a flat estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has remained constant at $2.90.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $99.3 million, suggesting a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

This launch came on the heels of the European CE-IVD mark for the device earlier. This panel was validated and registered under IVDD in May 2022.More About TaqPath PanelThis panel, apart from detecting GI bacteria, also helps in identifying the root cause of an infection and administering the best suitable treatment fast. This newly-launched test uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to analyze stool samples for a range of common GI bacteria, including Salmonella spp.; Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC); Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter upsaliensis.Per the press release, testing using the TaqPath Enteric Bacterial Select Panel can be done in one test tube and can be scaled up to fit the needs of the lab by enabling up to 93 samples to be tested in one run. When conducted on Thermo Fisher’s QuantStudio 5 and QuantStudio 5 Dx systems, results from samples are interpreted and generated automatically. This helps in saving laboratorians’ time so they can focus on other tasks.How is This Test Superior?According to Thermo Fisher, this TaqPath Enteric Bacterial Select Panel is able to reliably return results in about two hours with more than 98% sensitivity and specificity. This compares to culturing samples in a laboratory, which can take up to two weeks to deliver results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThermo Fisher claims that this advanced panel’s ability to identify and differentiate between the most common diarrhea-causing pathogens will make testing more accessible, providing laboratorians with more agility when identifying GI bacteria. With the specificity of the panel to detect different pathogens in a single test, this panel can preserve precious lab resources while providing critical information about the patient needed for the right treatment option.Story continuesThermo Fisher International Operations UpdateThermo Fisher boasts strong international operations. It has witnessed consistent growth in the high-growth and emerging markets. In the second quarter of 2022, Asia Pacific grew in low double digits, with China growing over 20%. Growth in China was primarily driven by increasing demand for COVID-19 testing through the second quarter.Share Price PerformanceThermo Fisher has outperformed its industry in the past year.

The platform is expected to have the capability of significantly reducing a program’s timeline to GMP for viral vector gene therapy developers. This, in turn, will likely reduce the timeline to less than eight months, unlike traditional manufacturing workflows.The nAAVigation platform accelerates time to clinic by leveraging various sources, including established development processes, among others.Management believes that the nAAVigation platform will likely support its cell and gene therapy clients from early target identification through clinical-stage manufacturing as well as increase speed and efficiency for viral vector production.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets published on GlobeNewswire, the global cell and gene therapy market is expected to grow from $6.58 billion in 2021 to $21.33 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 25.6%.

The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow plummeted 75 and 32 basis points each.Factors Impacting Market DipThe downturn of the key metrics is attributed to the persistent slumping of technology stocks due to the coronavirus pandemic-triggered supply-chain constraints.Moreover, the ongoing geopolitical tensions remain concerning. On Oct 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security released a report mentioning export rules to control US companies' sale of advanced computing semiconductors and related manufacturing equipment to China. This caused a dip in tech stocks, hitting Nasdaq the hardest on Monday.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the China-Taiwan conflict, inducing global sanctions and energy crisis in the European Union, continue to affect the market.All the aforesaid factors have been triggering the inflation rate due to which the Federal Reserve has taken hawkish stance to achieve a 2% target rate.The annual inflation rate is 8.3% for the 12 months ended August 2022,according to the U.S. Labor Department data published on Sep 13, 2022.To counter inflation woes, the Federal Reserve has been hiking the interest rate.On Sep 21, 2022, the Fed announced an interest rate hike of 75 basis points, marking the fifth rate increase this year. The Fed expects rates to reach 4.4% by this year-end, up from the current range of 3-3.25%.We note that the contractionary monetary policy will continue to raise the cost of borrowing, thereby affecting consumer spending. It will also result in a higher unemployment rate, slowing down economic growth. The United States recorded two successive quarters of downslide.Story continuesDefensive Stocks Provide a Hedge Against Market UnrestWeighing the current market conditions and the growing fears of an upcoming recession, it would be wise for investors to park their money in the defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care.These sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services, which consumers will continue to avail even in the worst economic times.Stocks catering to the defensive sectors are less likely to get affected by the economic turbulence and will thus remain a suitable choice for risk-averse investors.In addition, defensive stocks tend to offer high-dividend yields, and cater to capital preservation and income generation, thereby emerging as solid picks for investors to diversify their portfolios and generate stable earnings.Our Top Stock SuggestionsWe recommend four defensive stocks as these are less sensitive to taking a hit from an economic downturn. Apart from strong fundamentals, these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B. Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers.

Genuine Parts (GPC), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this auto and industrial parts distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 9.16%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Genuine Parts came out with earnings of $2.20 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02 per share, representing a surprise of 8.91%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.70 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.86 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.41%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Genuine Parts. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 20, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

NSANY and Renault RNLSY have recently announced that the two companies are in discussion about the future of their long-standing partnership. It has been reported that Nissan wants Renault to cut down its stake to 15% from 43%.Renault acquired a majority stake in the Japan-based automaker over two decades ago, at a time when Nissan struggled with debts and losses during the Asian financial crisis and Renault, through its stance, had bailed out Nissan. Renault now holds 43% of the company, which in turn has a 15% stake in its French partner without voting rights. Per sources, Nissan is not satisfied with Renault’s huge stake and is likely aimed at drawing to a level with its share in the latter.The French carmaker, in a bid to rev up its electrification progress, has laid out intensive revamp plans under which it aims to build up two EV units, code named Ampere and Horse. One entity will be dedicated to EVs and software. It would be based in the country and employ about 10,000 people by 2023. A second entity would focus on internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and be based outside France, with around 10,000 staff.Renault is not enthusiastic in bringing down its stake. However, it hopes to win Nissan as an investor in its new EV venture, especially to gain market share overseas. Per reports, Nissan’s decision to invest is conditioned on Renault’s reduction of its stake.Talks are ongoing that Nissan may consider raising funds to buy back the shares that are held by Renault.It is believed that a strategized sell down of the stakes will take place, likely not at one go but in tranches and eventually Nissan will get the upper hand in the sales.Earlier this year, the two automakers along with Mitsubishi formed an alliance to co-develop EVs. The companies together planned to invest more than $23 billion in EV development over the next five years and expected to come up with more than 30 new EVs fortified by five common platforms by 2030. The partnership was a celebrated one as it had a shared vision of electrified mobility.Sources have said that Mitsubishi was also considering taking a single-digit percent stake in Renault's new EV unit.It seems that Nissan has set a firm foot over being an equal player in acquiring stakes and is determined to bring down Renault’s capital holding in what has been a contentious issue for quite some time.Shares of NSANY have lost 37.7% over the past year compared with its industry’s 38.6% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksNSANY currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Cummins Inc.

""Blade"" is now slated to premiere on Sept. 6, 2024 instead of Nov. 3, 2023, which has impacted the rest of the studios' production scheduling.""Deadpool 3"" has moved from Sept. 6, 2024 to Nov. 8, 2024; ""Fantastic Four"" has been shifted from Nov. 8, 2024 to Feb. 14, 2025; an untitled Marvel project was moved from Feb. 14, 2025 to Nov. 7, 2025; ""Avengers: Secret Wars"" has been pushed from Nov. 7, 2025 to May 1, 2026; and an untitled Marvel movie went from May 1, 2026 to no longer being on Disney's release schedule.A source familiar with the studio's plans told Reuters that Marvel is using the ""Blade"" production break to find a replacement for Tariq to work with ""Moon Knight"" writer Beau DeMayo, who's the main screenwriter for ""Blade.”An unnamed source with authority on the film starring Oscar winner Mahershala Ali told The Hollywood Reporter that ""They want to get it right,"" which subsequently means delays.The Marvel Blade character who first appeared in comic book ""The Tomb of Dracula,"" written by Marv Wolfman in 1973 eventually had his own storyline that was later adapted into the Wesley Snipes film trilogy which includes, ""Blade,"" ""Blade II"" and ""Blade Trinity.”Throughout the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse, stories have been intertwined and a significant delay from one film often impacts the slate for others. A similar postponement was made for the film ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" due to the pandemic and led to ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" being pushed back as well.

325,ccda9af1-3a7a-3f2e-9778-cf491f9f2d41,DIS,2022-10-12,Investors Heavily Search The Walt Disney Company (DIS): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-walt-disney-130001121.html,1665493201,STORY,['DIS'],"[Walt Disney (DIS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -18.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 16.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +59.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +68.1%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.06 indicates a change of +31.4% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Disney.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $21.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $83.81 billion and $93.35 billion estimates indicate +24.3% and +11.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.3%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $0.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.83%. The EPS surprise was +15.96%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The rate hike approval from the commission will allow the company to recover more than $220 million of investments made since 2018 in its 7,200-mile natural gas infrastructure system.The new approval rate will generate an estimated $8.8 million of new annual revenues and a return on equity of 9.6%. The funds coming in from the rate hike will assist Black Hills in achieving its Net Zero emissions target by 2035 for its natural gas distribution system.Rate hikes increase the monthly utility bills of customers, but we all need a reliable 24X7 energy supply, so strengthening and expansion of infrastructure is quite essential. Domestic-focused, capital-intensive and regulated utilities need rate hikes at regular intervals to continue with infrastructure upgrades and recoup investments made to provide quality services to their customers.Utilities Invest in InfrastructureThe ongoing hike in interest rates is hurting utilities by increasing the cost of financing and planned budget for projects. Amid such a backdrop, few utilities in the same industry having well-chalked-out investment plans for strengthening their services are NextEra Energy NEE, Alliant Energy LNT and Exelon Corporation EXC.NextEra Energy aims to invest $85-$95 billion from 2022 through 2025 to strengthen its infrastructure.

The long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of NextEra is currently pegged at 9.66%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Alliant Energy announced plans to invest substantially over the next four years to strengthen the electric and gas distribution networks as well as add natural gas and renewable assets to the generation portfolio. LNT has plans to strengthen electric and natural gas distribution systems and make regular investments to boost infrastructure. It plans to invest $6.1 billion between 2022 and 2025. After the planned expenditure, the company plans to follow it up with an investment of $7-$9 billion for 2026-2030. The long-term earnings growth of Alliant Energy is currently pegged at 6.16%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2.Exelon plans to invest nearly $29 billion during the 2022-2025 period in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to benefit customers. Such systematic investments are going to boost the long-term earnings of the company. The current dividend yield of the company is 3.6% and its long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.11%.

327,f8cd1541-19c7-3928-9cea-ffa34765bb56,OKE,2022-10-12,"ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) Has A ROE Of 26%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-nyse-oke-roe-120040901.html,1665576040,STORY,['OKE'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for ONEOK How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ONEOK is:26% = US$1.6b ÷ US$6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit.Does ONEOK Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see ONEOK has a similar ROE to the average in the Oil and Gas industry classification (26%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for ONEOK by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining ONEOK's Debt And Its 26% Return On EquityONEOK clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.26. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course ONEOK may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Meta announced the NBCU pact at Meta Connect 2022, its annual developers conference, alongside other content partnerships and product news.The new VR content from NBCU, set to come to Meta’s Horizon Worlds service in 2023, will include virtual-reality experiences for hit sitcom “The Office,” Universal Monsters, DreamWorks Animation, Blumhouse and Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights.The centerpiece from the Connect presentation: CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta Quest Pro, the next generation of the company’s VR headsets. Priced at $1,500, the device will ship on Oct. 25. That’s three times the current list price of the more expensive Meta Quest 2 models ($500 for 256 gigabytes of storage, $400 with 128 GB).Previously code-named Project Cambria, the higher-end VR and mixed-reality headset is the first headset from Meta that integrates inward-facing sensors to “capture natural facial expressions and eye tracking,” according to the company. Meta Quest Pro’s outward-facing cameras capture four times as many pixels as Meta Quest 2 — making it the company’s first full-color mixed reality device — and features a sleeker design with a new, curved battery on the back. The unit includes 256 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, 10 advanced VR/MR sensors and spatial audio support.“Virtual reality isn’t some obscure hobby anymore,” said Zuckerberg, claiming that millions of people are already using VR to play games, interact with others and collaborate with coworkers.Among other news, Meta announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring its suite of productivity software and Xbox Cloud Gaming service to the Meta Quest headset. In addition, Meta announced plans to integrate Microsoft Teams and Zoom conferencing into its VR workspaces, to let users participate using their avatars.Story continuesAlso on the gaming front, Meta revealed that “Marvel’s Iron Man VR,” previously available on PlayStation VR, will be coming to Meta Quest 2 on Nov. 3 through a deal with Sony Interactive Entertainment and Marvel Entertainment. In addition, “Among Us VR” will launch for Meta Quest 2 on Nov. 10 and Skydance Interactive’s “The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution” will debut for the platform Dec. 1.Meta also showed off enhancements to avatars available across its platforms — including the addition of legs, with the introduction of full-body avatars. (It’s “surprisingly difficult” for VR to represent legs, according to Zuckerberg.) Meta’s VR avatars also will be getting new options for body types and skin tone, as well as new outfits including those coming from Netflix. Zuckerberg also showed off Meta’s research on eerily photorealistic VR avatars.“We’ve investing in this because we believe there’s massive potential here,” Zuckerberg said.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.On the NBCU partnership, details aren’t immediately available for what Peacock or the other experiences in VR will look like on the Meta Quest headset.For its part, NBCU clearly is looking for every opportunity it can to push some wind into Peacock’s sails. Last week NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell claimed the media company’s streamer gained more than 2 million paid subscribers in the third quarter, to top 15 million. That came after Peacock’s paid customer base was flat in Q2. Shell credited a strong content lineup, including Peacock’s reclaiming day-after-air rights to episodes of NBCU shows from Hulu.According to Meta, the Quest Store has generated $1.5 billion in sales to date, and that 33 of the 400 VR titles in the library have grossed more than $10 million to date. That said, Meta’s Reality Labs, which encompasses its VR and AR businesses, has been a drag on the company’s overall earnings. For the second quarter of 2022, Reality Labs’ operating loss widened to $2.81 billion versus a loss of $2.43 billion a year earlier as revenue increased $452 million (up 48% year over year).VIP+ Analysis: What’s Ahead in Gaming/Entertainment SpaceBest of VarietyThe Best Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2022: From 'House of the Dragon' to 'Euphoria'Constance Wu Gets Candid in Revealing New Memoir 'Making a Scene'What's Coming to Netflix in October 2022]"

But in the short term the market is a voting machine, and the share price movements may not reflect the underlying business performance. The Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) is down 17% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -13% once you include the dividend. That's better than the market which declined 22% over the last year. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 1.0% in three years.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately Prudential Financial reported an EPS drop of 70% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 17% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Prudential Financial's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Prudential Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Prudential Financial, it has a TSR of -13% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Prudential Financial shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 13% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 1.0% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.United Rentals has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Construction Partners has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that URI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.89, while ROAD has a forward P/E of 32.57.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Oracle hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Oracle peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Oracle will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Oracle's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 55%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 31% in aggregate. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 36% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Oracle's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Oracle's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Oracle (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Oracle.

The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people.Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of roughly 15%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%.During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time.Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total.

On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 32%, less than the market return of 51%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Public Storage While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Public Storage achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Public Storage has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Public Storage the TSR over the last 5 years was 62%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Public Storage shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.5% over one year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 10% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people.Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of roughly 15%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%.During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time.Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total.

(NASDAQ:MU) is less than four decades old, but in the semiconductor industry, that’s ages.Back in the dark ages, Micron Technology’s single product was a 64-kilobyte memory card that could only contain about half a newspaper’s worth of information. Over the years, the company has expanded the capacity of its memory chips hundreds of thousands of times over and has broadened out into chips that can power a host of products.Now, Micron is one of the largest producers of memory chips in the world.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd a few months ago, I spoke about how the semiconductor chip shortage negatively affected the company’s third-quarter earnings.Semiconductors are integral devices in PCs, cars, cameras, smartphones, gaming hardware, medical equipment… anything technological. With all that demand, COVID-19 plant shutdowns and on-going supply chain issues, the chip market has suffered.The SPDR S&amp;P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), which tracks a basket of chip stocks, is down 31% year-to-date (YTD). It is also underperforming the S&amp;P 500, which is down 21% during the same time frame.So, in today’s Market 360, let’s take a look at Micron’s two recent announcements: its fourth-quarter earnings and its plan to build the largest U.S. chip plant ever. And we’ll discuss what it all means for the future of the chip industry…Micron’s Fourth Quarter EarningsMicron released its fourth-quarter earnings on September 29.And, unfortunately folks, they continued to decline.For the fiscal quarter, Micron reported earnings of $1.45 per share, beating analysts estimates of $1.30 per share but down 44% from earnings of $2.59 per share last quarter. Revenue came in at $6.64 billion, down from $8.64 billion last quarter and $8.27 billion for the same period last year.Taking a look at my Portfolio Grader, Micron right now has a C-rating. This means that, although the stock is not a “Sell” after its earnings announcement, it is still a “Hold.”Story continuesLouis Navelliers portfolio grader rating for MUThe company expects fiscal first-quarter 2023 revenue of about $4.25 billion, plus or minus $250 million versus average analyst estimates of $5.62 billion. It also expects adjusted earnings of about $0.4 per share, plus or minus $0.10 per share, versus average estimates of $0.64 per share.So, it seems like earnings will continue to fall as the semiconductor chip shortage continues.However, Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron, said, “We expect to emerge from this downcycle well positioned to capitalize on the long-term demand for memory and storage.”And how does the company plan to capitalize on demand?Micron to Open Largest U.S. Semiconductor FactoryOn Tuesday, Micron announced that it plans to build a chip manufacturing plant in upstate New York. Predicted to take at least two decades and up to $100 billion, this will be the largest semiconductor factory ever built in the U.S.The plant will be located in Clay, New York, just north of Syracuse. The company chose this location because of its proximity to “leading higher education institutions, access to talent traditionally underrepresented in technology jobs and a significant military population” which aligns with Micron’s “commitment to veteran hiring.” The company also said the site offers access to “water and clean, reliable power.”Micron can build this plant after the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 this past August. The Act provides $52 billion in grants and subsidies for companies to build and expand computer chip factories in the country.Micron said preparations for the site are set to begin next year, with construction to begin in 2024 and chip production in 2025.As the U.S. has become reliant on foreign semiconductors chips, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic and with more people working from home, the hope is that Micron’s new factory will remove us from the current overseas supply chain issue.Shares of the company rose 4.3% on Tuesday.With its manufacturing growth ahead, it will be interesting to see how this news affects Micron’s earnings growth in the future.As you know, I like companies with strong fundamentals and earnings growth. My system is exclusively designed to scour the stock market for individual, high-quality shares.In other words, I zero in on the companies that stand to profit the most from the next big cycle.And I predict an “Impact Event” is coming that could give you some of the greatest investment opportunities of your lifetime.It’s an event so huge, that Bank of America says it will hit with a $150 trillion aftershock… and could send tremors rippling across markets for the next three decades straight.And the key to preparing for this “Impact Event” going forward is to simply identify as many of these cash-rich, quality companies as you can… while prices are still low enough that you could make a substantial return.To get ready for the “Impact Event,” click here.Sincerely,Source: InvestorPlace unless otherwise notedLouis NavellierThe Editor hereby discloses that as of the date of this email, the Editor, directly or indirectly, owns the following securities that are the subject of the commentary, analysis, opinions, advice, or recommendations in, or which are otherwise mentioned in, the essay set forth below:Micron Technology, Inc.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Mettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Mettler-Toledo International with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International How Fast Is Mettler-Toledo International Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Mettler-Toledo International's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Mettler-Toledo International maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 11% to US$3.9b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Mettler-Toledo International Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$26b company like Mettler-Toledo International. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$381m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Should You Add Mettler-Toledo International To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Mettler-Toledo International has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Mettler-Toledo International has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

349,d0aa9255-b35a-3138-8c38-299055276048,HAS,2022-10-12,Analysts Estimate Hasbro (HAS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-hasbro-report-decline-140002369.html,1665496802,STORY,['HAS'],"[The market expects Hasbro (HAS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.68 billion, down 15% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of +30.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hasbro doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BrandsYum! Brands, Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureTo celebrate and honor this month, we're amplifying the voices of those within the Hispanic+Latin community. They will share their journey and experiences that led them to where they are today. Read Sharon's story below.Meet Sharon! She leads the Digital Menu Management Team and brings tacos to fans across the web via app, kiosk and delivery. Not only that, but she also empowers restaurant teams with the product data behind many of our back-of-house technologies. Sharon believes in being your own biggest fan and that instead of hiding what makes us different and being ashamed of those differences, we should celebrate them and use them as opportunities to offer a unique perspective. ""It's hard for others to recognize you as a leader when you don't see yourself as a leader in the first place - so take pride in being yourself and lead with confidence,"" she said.But how did she get to that point? Born and raised in Santa Ana, CA, Sharon is a graduate of UC Santa Cruz (UCSC). She enjoys people and technology, so she earned her BS in Cognitive Science, choosing the Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence discipline. When she isn't working, you might find her at a local brewery, shopping at a pop-up market or listening to live music. This rollerblading adventurist is proud of her roots and excited to share a piece of her journey with us all.Both of her parents emigrated from Jalpa, Zacatecas, Mexico; however, they didn't meet until they both arrived in California. Her mother headed to Los Angeles and her dad went to Santa Ana. Which brings us to the funny story about how she got her name… when her parents started dating, her dad would commute to LA twice a week and every time he drove past a certain department store with the name Sharon in it, he would think to himself, ""I like that name. If I ever have a daughter, I'm naming her Sharon.""And one day, that daughter was born. Sharon grew up with Taco Bell playing an important part of her family's lifestyle. ""Money was tight growing up, so we often visited Taco Bell for the $2 deals."" She shares that several of her childhood memories are at a particular Taco Bell in Santa Ana. One of her favorites is when her sister graduated from high school in 2016. ""We gave her free reign to choose ANY restaurant for her celebratory dinner and she chose Taco Bell.""Story continuesCan you believe that it was a wild accident that brought her to the company? After graduating UCSC, she was working as a cashier at a retail store and felt defeated from the several job applications that didn't align with her career goals or turned out to be dead ends. Five weeks into working the cashier job, she fell down her apartment stairs and broke her big toe to the point of reconstruction surgery. She had to resign from being a cashier and took time to focus on her recovery. It was while on her way to physical therapy that she drove by the Taco Bell HQ and was surprised to see that they were in Irvine. As soon as she got home, she opened the careers site and applied for the IT Service Desk position.While she is fortunate enough to love the work that she does now, her past challenges made her current reality a hard one to imagine. She reflects on high school and how transferring to a new school district right before her freshmen year nearly derailed her plans for her future. ""I didn't know anyone and was just one of a couple Latin students at the school."" She experienced outwardly racist remarks from students and occasional stereotypical remarks from teachers, too. ""The subliminal remarks were the ones that would leave me hurt and confused, like, ‘Is it just me? Am I overreacting? That was a compliment, right?'"" At the same time, others doubted or discouraged her from applying to four-year colleges.Despite coming home upset most days, Sharon did not let the cruel remarks set her back. She still remembers her mom's advice and the simplest, yet powerful question asked of her, ""Why are you listening to them?""It was at that moment when Sharon made the decision never to allow anyone else to make her feel bad about herself. She has kept that rule close to her and is actively encouraging others to find a community that supports them and be that community for someone else. ""It was an extremely challenging time but I'm grateful for the lessons learned, I wouldn't be a ‘mujer fuerte' [strong woman] otherwise.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

This year the survey suggested American teens are eager to get back to dining out following the COVID-19 pandemic.""Restaurant spending has grown to account for an increasing portion of the broader teen wallet over time, passing positive territory in Spring 2014,"" the survey noted, ""Despite a flattening out during COVID, we believe teens’ preference for restaurant and dining out occasions is positioned to rebound as behavioral spending patterns normalize.""Among average income teens, who come from households with total income of $66,497, Chick-Fil-A took the No. 1 spot with 14% share, followed by Starbucks at 12%, old favorite McDonald's, 7%, Chipotle, 5%, and Olive Garden coming in at No. 5 with 4%.Chick-fil-A is #1!CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MAY 06: A worker takes orders as customers line up in the drive-thru lane at a Chick-fil-A restaurant on May 06, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. Chicken prices have risen sharply this year as suppliers struggle to keep up with demand, fueled in part, by the popularity of new chicken offerings from fast-food restaurants. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)One reason for its top ranking: Chick-fil-A was able to maintain relatively steady foot traffic compared to pre-pandemic visit numbers, according to data intelligence platform Placer.ai, thanks to its ""significant"" store expansion. The Georgia-based chain Chick-fil-A recently opened its location in Hawaii, topping more than 2,700 restaurants in 47 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Canada.Chick-fil-A, not only popular among teens but ultra-popular among consumers overall. (It must be, given the long waits folks have to endure. According to a new study from Intouch Insight and QSR, locations are expected to have an average of 4.74 cars in line, making it the slowest drive-thru in America with an average total time spent of more than 8 minutes.)Back in Spring of 2022, Chick-fil-A also held the top spot among average income teens with 14% share followed by Starbucks at 11%, McDonald's, 7%, Chipotle, 5%, and Olive Garden, 3%.Story continuesAnother chain, Chipotle, maintained its No. 4 spot with teens with 5% market share.Piper Sandler considers it the ""most preferred at Hispanic cuisine levels across both upper-income and average-income teens""— a big opportunity for market share gains overall said Piper Sandler Managing Director Nicole Miller Regan.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 10: People walk past a Chipotle store on August 10, 2022 in New York City. NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced on Tuesday that Chipotle Mexican Grill announced that they will be paying $20 million dollars to current and former workers in their NYC restaurants for violating city labor laws. The settlement will cover about 13,000 employees who worked at the chain's NYC stores between 2017 and this year. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Starbucks, meanwhile, rose in the rankings to the No. 2 spot, holding 12% share—up from 11% this past spring and 10% share last fall. Why? Cold drinks. On a call with analysts, Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz called cold beverages a ""Gen Z product"" for the brand, while customization options lend a ""competitive advantage in our ability to customize almost any beverage that our customers want with speed.""Cold beverages accounted for 75% of beverage sales in the company's fiscal third quarter earnings report. Other public coffee companies like Dutch Bros (BROS), which announced plans to ramp up store openings this year, and Black Rifle Coffee Company (BRCC), did not rank among the teens surveyed.McDonald's (MCD) held its prime spot in the top five at No. 4.Among average-income teens specifically, it ranks No. 3 with 7%, higher than last fall where it held 5% of share. ""Looking forward, we believe the brand's ongoing efforts to drive heightened levels of digital engagement could help to drive incremental traction with teens,"" Regan added.In the company's most recent quarterly report, digital sales exceeded $6 billion dollars representing one-third of total systemwide sales. This comes after the launched its app-driven MyMcDonald’s Rewards program in 2021. Once customers download the app and join, freebies including free Hash Browns, Vanilla Cone, McChicken or Cheeseburger can be ""unlocked"" after the first order.That's one way to keep teens happy — and brands strong.MIAMI, FLORIDA - JULY 26: Customers wait to order food at a McDonalds fast food restaurant on July 26, 2022 in Miami, Florida. The McDonald's company reported U.S. same-store sales rose 3.7%, while international sales rose 9.7% during the most recent quarter. However, it also said that total revenue fell 3% to $5.72 billion; it attributed the weakness to slowing demand in China.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Prologis PLD, EastGroup Properties, Inc. EGP, STAG Industrial, Inc. STAG, Terreno Realty Corp. TRNO and Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Industrial REITs to Shine in Q3 Earnings on Robust DemandThe industrial real estate asset category has been playing a crucial role in the growing e-commerce market, transforming how consumers shop and receive their goods. Moreover, apart from e-retail, companies are making strategic moves to boost supply-chain efficiencies, spurring demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks.This brings the focus on industrial landlords like Prologis, EastGroup Properties, Inc., STAG Industrial, Inc. and Terreno Realty Corp., which are poised to benefit from this favorable environment. And with the Q3 reporting season around the corner, it’s time to check how they are placed ahead of their earnings.What is encouraging is that despite the economic headwinds and uncertainty and the recession woes in the third quarter, the U.S. industrial market fundamentals remained strong and steady per a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, with “heightened levels of absorption” and rents scaling new highs.There was a net absorption of 108.2 million square feet (msf) of space in the September-end quarter, a level consistent with very strong demand. It also marks the eighth straight quarter where absorption surpassed the 100 msf mark. Through the first three quarters of the current year, absorption totaled 358.8 msf, which is higher than any year on record except 2021. Moreover, the new leasing activity reached 163.1 msf in the third quarter.Story continuesThe U.S. industrial vacancy rate remained “tight” at 3.2%, denoting a 20-basis point (bps) quarter-over-quarter uptick. Moreover, each region in the United States once again reported vacancy rates sub-4%, with the lowest being the West region at only 2.5%.With elevated demand and high occupancy rates, rental rates continued to scale new heights. The U.S. overall industrial asking rental rate ended the third quarter at $8.70 per square foot (psf), denoting a 4% sequential increase and a 22% annual surge. In fact, it marked the strongest year-over-year growth rate recorded, per the Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.Resilience is essential to the future supply chain and so, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from a likely increase in inventory levels.However, with the asset category being attractive, there is a development boom in a number of markets. Per the CWK report, development activity picked up pace in the third quarter, with 148.2 msf of industrial facilities being delivered throughout the United States, the highest quarterly total on record. Also, the industrial construction pipeline reached another all-time high of 716.9 msf in the third quarter, which is 2.6% ahead of the previous high a quarter ago. The high supply is likely to have intensified competition during the September-end quarter.Here’s how these Industrial REITs are placed ahead of Q3 earnings:Prologis is a leading industrial REIT that acquires, develops, operates and manages industrial properties in the United States and worldwide. The company continues to benefit from the scale of its platform. Recently, Prologis completed the acquisition of Duke Realty. Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share on three occasions and missed in the other, the average beat being 0.71%. This industrial REIT behemoth carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) presently.Prologis is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 19, before the bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.13 billion, suggesting an 8.8% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share is presently pegged at $1.73, calling for a 66.4% surge year over year.EastGroup Properties is engaged in the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties and focuses on properties in major Sunbelt markets throughout the United States, emphasizing on assets in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. With its strategy of ownership of high-quality distribution facilities clustered near major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets, this industrial REIT is expected to have benefited from the robust fundamentals of the industrial real estate market.Currently, EGP carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a decent surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.19%.EastGroup Properties is scheduled to release its earnings on Oct 25, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for July-September quarter revenues is currently pegged at $125.2 million, indicating a 19.7% increase year on year. The estimate for quarterly FFO per share has moved 2 cents north in the past two months to $1.75 and also suggests a 12.9% jump year over year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.STAG Industrial, which focuses on the acquisition, ownership and operation of industrial properties throughout the United States, is also anticipated to have witnessed healthy demand on the fast adoption of e-commerce, with leasing activity getting support in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, with supply chains transforming for faster fulfillment and resilience, STAG is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals.Presently, STAG Industrial carries a Zacks Rank #2. Over the trailing four quarters, it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed in the other, the average beat being 2.40%.STAG's quarterly results will be released on Oct 27, after market close. The consensus mark for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $165.85 million, suggesting a 16.7% increase from the year-earlier quarter. The estimate for quarterly FFO per share of 54 cents also calls for a 1.89% uptick year on year.Terreno Realty targets functional assets at in-fill locations, which enjoy high-population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points. Backed by such efforts, the company is well poised to fortify its portfolio in the six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, DC — which display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estates.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met the same in one quarter and missed in the other, the average beat being 0.55%. Currently, TRNO carries a Zacks Rank #2.Terreno Realty is expected to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter on or about Nov 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $64.6 million, calling for a 12.7% increase, year on year. The consensus mark of 50 cents for the quarterly FFO per share also calls for an 11.1% increase year over year.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Adding the analytics capability to the most frictionless cloud storage, Seagate enables enterprises to activate their stored data in an open data lake architecture for analytics at petabyte scale, further accelerating time to implementation and innovation, yielding up to 40% cost saving compared to other available offerings in the market.In today’s datasphere, multicloud has become a mainstream cloud strategy for enterprises, but complex data access challenges and unpredictable costs hinder optimal data utilization. These challenges pose even larger roadblocks for data-intensive industries where enterprises rely heavily on the vast amount of collected data to train their data analytics, AI, and machine learning systems. According to the research firm Gartner, only 53% of AI projects achieve production from prototype due to the lack of right tools to scale.Leveraging its own leading manufacturing experience, Seagate is offering pre-configured full-stack analytics code solutions for time-series, tabular data management, and image analytics along with included professional services that can dramatically reduce time to implement analytics in a production environment from 12-18 months to less than 4 months.""With the increasing use of data analytics and AI to achieve greater efficiency, sustainability, and innovation for business growth, the introduction of Lyve Cloud Analytics platform was the most sought-after feature for Lyve Cloud,"" said Ravi Naik, chief information officer and executive vice president storage services for Seagate. ""Through Lyve Cloud Analytics platform, we allow our customers to break data silos and harness the power of data. We believe the platform with our professional services will make critical decision making easier, leading to higher efficiency, faster innovation, and business growth in the long run.""Story continuesAs one of the largest data storage manufacturers, Seagate too had to equip itself with the right cloud infrastructure. Every day, Seagate's seven large-scale AI-enabled manufacturing sites around the world generate over 50TB of image and parametric data, which are added to its 15PB data lake and made available for analytics.""As Seagate strives for best-in-class quality and efficiency, we have invested heavily in analytics and AI. One of the biggest improvements is in our wafer manufacturing process where we successfully removed a number of the tens of thousands of steps in the overall production process,"" said Sthitie Bom, senior engineering director at Seagate Technology. ""Within a two-year period, through the analytics framework developed by the Seagate team, we increased the number of skippable sampling steps by 150% which allowed us to significantly reduce wafer cycle time. We anticipate an additional three-fold increase as our analytics framework advances within the Lyve Cloud Analytics platform over the coming years, resulting in significant capital savings.""Lyve Cloud Analytics platform will benefit enterprises in manufacturing and other multi-petabyte data scale industries, including semiconductor, healthcare, retail, energy, and more. The pre-configured full-stack offering in partnership and integration with various leading analytics and computing providers presents enterprises with a smart and out-of-the-box solution to innovate and grow their business.Find out more about the Seagate Lyve Cloud Analytics platform here.About SeagateSeagate Technology crafts the datasphere, helping to maximize humanity’s potential by innovating world-class, precision-engineered mass-data storage and management solutions with a focus on sustainable partnerships.

During these times of heightened volatility, it is advantageous for investors to have an additional layer of defense injected into their portfolios.So, how can investors blend defense into their portfolios?One excellent option is targeting blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks are companies that have consistently provided quality, reliability, and the ability to operate profitably in both good and bad times. In addition, they generally carry rock-solid dividend metrics.Simply put, these companies know how to make money.And they’ve been great at doing so throughout their history.Three top-ranked blue-chip stocks – The Kroger Co. KR, Humana HUM, and American Express AXP – would all be excellent considerations for investors in a historically-volatile 2022.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies YTD, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPairing the powerful Zacks Rank with a long-established track record of success is undoubtedly a beautiful duo that instills a high level of confidence moving forward.Let’s take a deeper dive into each one.The Kroger Co.Kroger, a long-time retailer residing in the thin-margin grocery industry, operates approximately 2,700 retail stores under its various banners and divisions in 35 states.Analysts have upped their earnings outlook across the board over the last several months, helping push the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to a favorable near-term earnings outlook, Kroger shares are cheap; the company’s current 10.9X forward earnings multiple is well below its 12.6X five-year median and reflects an enticing 53% discount relative to its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKR sports a Style Score of an A for Value.For the cherry on top, Kroger’s dividend metrics would excite any income-focused investor – the company’s annual dividend yields a respectable 2.4% paired with a sustainable payout ratio at 21% of earnings.Story continuesEven more impressive, the company has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, translating to a double-digit 13.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican ExpressAmerican Express is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services worldwide. AXP currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Analysts have been bullish across nearly all timeframes over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAXP shares have become notably cheap in 2022 – the company’s 13.9X forward P/E ratio sits well below its five-year median of 15.7X and 2021 highs of 23.3X.American Express carries a Style Score of a B for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAXP’s annual dividend yield of 1.5% is visibly lower than its Zacks Sector average of 2.6%, but the company’s 7.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Further, the company has upped its dividend payout three times over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana Humana is a health care plan provider in the United States, providing health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization, Private Fee-For-Service, and Preferred Provider Organization plans.Like AXP and KR, Humana has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, pushing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana has a stellar growth profile – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $25.01 for the company’s current fiscal year (FY22) suggests Y/Y earnings growth of a double-digit 21.2%.And in FY23, estimates call for an additional 12% of bottom line growth.The forecasted earnings growth comes on top of projected revenue increases of 11.8% and 9% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana’s annual dividend yield of 0.6% is undoubtedly on the lower end of the spectrum, well below its Zacks Medical sector average of 1.6%.However, Humana’s dividend growth is impossible to ignore; HUM has upped its dividend payout six times over the last five years, paired with a stellar 23.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineIt goes without saying that deploying a heavier defensive approach in 2022 is more than valid.The Fed's ongoing tightening cycle, paired with geopolitical uncertainties and lingering COVID-19 restrictions, has caused many stocks to pull back significantly in 2022.However, blue-chip stocks weather a dark fiscal cloud better than most.All three stocks above – The Kroger Co. KR, Humana HUM, and American Express AXP – would all be excellent considerations for investors in a historically-volatile 2022.All three carry a favorable Zacks Rank paired with a fully established nature through years and years of successful business operations.For the cherry on top, they also reward their shareholders handsomely through their dividend payouts, further cushioning drawdowns in other positions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On October 7, 2022, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) stock closed at $320.25 per share. One-month return of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) was -10.12%, and its shares lost 10.49% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) has a market capitalization of $19.975 billion.Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:""Aggregates producer Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) was one of the largest detractors for the quarter. Despite robust demand and positive pricing momentum, labor shortages, logistics challenges and cost inflation outpaced top-line improvement. Specifically, management cited the higher-than-anticipated rise in energy costs as a primary driver of the company’s yearover-year decline in profit margins. Nevertheless, annual price increases effective April 1, some of the largest in Martin Marietta’s recent history, and a second round of price increases in July are expected to more than offset cost pressures, resulting in long-term margin expansion. We believe the company’s ability to navigate this challenging environment with strong pricing power highlights Martin Marietta’s leading market position and geographically advantaged asset base. Furthermore, the company completed the sale of its Colorado and Central Texas ready mixed concrete operations during the period in line with its SOAR 2025 priorities. This divesture contributes to the overall optimization of Martin Marietta’s aggregates-led portfolio, which should reduce business cyclicality and raw material cost inflation exposure in the long run.""wandee007/Shutterstock.comStory continuesMartin Marietta Materials, Inc.

""Importantly, Tractor Supply is on track to achieve several monumental milestones in the growth of our company including annual revenues in excess of $14 billion, a store base of over 2,100 Tractor Supply locations and a highly engaged workforce of 50,000 Team Members. We are excited to build on our track record of long-term growth as we look to unlock revenue and earnings opportunities with this attractive acquisition that enhances our growth profile.""Story continuesLawton continued, ""While agreeing to this remedy with the FTC took longer than we anticipated, the outcome is in line with our expectations.

With a shared culture and values, we are excited to welcome the team to Tractor Supply and look forward to an exciting future going forward. We are honored to build on the legacy of Barry Orscheln and the team.""Financial Terms of the AcquisitionThe deal is an all-cash transaction that Tractor Supply anticipates financing through its balance sheet. The Company will acquire 166 Orscheln Farm and Home stores for approximately $320 million, before working capital adjustments. As part of the remedy reached with the FTC, Tractor Supply will divest 85 locations to two buyers, Bomgaars Supply, Inc. (73 stores) and Buchheit Enterprises, Inc. (12 stores), shortly after closing the transaction. Proceeds of the store divestitures will be approximately $72 million. In addition, Tractor Supply has agreed to sell the Orscheln Farm and Home corporate headquarters and distribution center to Bomgaars for approximately $10 million within 15 months after the closing of the transaction.The store divestitures and sale of the corporate headquarters and distribution center bring the net purchase price of the 81 stores acquired to approximately $238 million, before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is anticipated to generate an estimated future tax benefit of approximately $20 million.Financial Details and OutlookAdditional transaction highlights include:For the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022, the revenue from the acquisition is anticipated to add about $75 million to Tractor Supply’s net sales. Given the transaction expenses and early implementation costs to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, the impact of the acquisition is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income in the quarter and for the year.For fiscal 2023, the revenue from the acquisition is anticipated to add at least $300 million to Tractor Supply’s net sales and be accretive by at least $0.10 to diluted earnings per share. This considers anticipated integration expenses that will partially offset accretion in year one of the acquisition.Over the course of the next 15 months post-closing, the stores retained by Tractor Supply will be remodeled to the Tractor Supply brand.The Company is raising its outlook for store growth opportunities to 2,800 locations, an increase of 100 stores.Post-closing, the Company estimates it will have annual revenues over $14 billion, more than 2,100 Tractor Supply stores and 50,000 Team Members.Consistent with prior years’ convention, the Company will provide a comprehensive financial outlook for the coming fiscal year in conjunction with its fourth quarter 2022 earnings release on Thursday, January 26, 2023. Tractor Supply Company will release its third quarter 2022 earnings release before the market opens on Thursday, October 20, 2022.

(Nasdaq: MDLZ) marked the 130th anniversary of its Biscuit Flour Mill in Toledo, Ohio with a ceremony and day-long celebration on Saturday, October 8, which included local employees, local and state elected officials, and other honored guests from the Company and the local community.With more than a century and a quarter of ongoing milling operations, the Company’s Toledo Flour Mill is the largest dedicated soft-wheat mill in North America today, with one of the largest grain storage capacities at 5.5 million bushels of wheat. The Mill first began operations in 1892, when Benjamin Harrison was President of the United States and became part of the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in 1926. The Toledo Mill has made many significant contributions to the local economy and the grain milling industry in general, such as when scientists working at the Mill developed flour analysis tools that went on to become industry standards. Today, flour from the Toledo Mill is shipped to the Company’s bakeries across North America, where it is used to make many of its best-loved snacks, including Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies and Ritz crackers.“Our Toledo Flour Mill has been a valuable part of our U.S. baking footprint for more than a century, and I am proud to join this celebration with the many dedicated employees who have been part of our business for many years and have helped make this important milestone possible,” said Claudio Parrotta, SVP &amp; Chief Supply Chain Officer, North America at Mondelēz International. “I want to thank Plant Leader Dee Lewis and our dedicated team of employees in Toledo for all their hard work supporting our business and for putting together such a fitting tribute on this important milestone.”Story continuesFacts about Mondelēz International’s Toledo Flour Mill:Largest soft-flour mill in the United StatesApproximately 100 full-time employeesBegan operations in 1892 and became part of National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in 1926On average day, processes nearly 1,000 acres of wheat (equivalent to approximately 1,000 football fields!)On average day, produces more than 1,500 tons of flour (equivalent to weight of seven commercial airplanes!)Storage capacity of 5.5 million bushels of wheat (enough to fill nearly 5,500 semi-truck trailers!)Zero production waste to landfill facility and wheat supplier for Triscuit crackers, which recently piloted a field-to-shelf consumer transparency programIn addition to celebrating the Mill’s milestone anniversary, this event also recognized the employees who have helped make the Toledo Flour Mill so special over many decades.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $64.40 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Capital One shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Capital One is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Consumer Loans industry that ranks in the Bottom 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $5.15 per share to $5.14 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Capital One right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The researchers said the “top performing voice for the brand comes from owned media channels, and with having many region-specific accounts, Sephora was able to generate $82.8 million in MIV across owned social media during July to September.”The top-performing “partner voice” for Sephora was Rare Beauty, which garnered Sephora $6.5 million in MIV. “That being said, the top performing celebrity voice for the brand was Selena Gomez, whose social brand mentions in reference to Rare Beauty earned the brand $2.9 million in MIV across eight placements ($1.6 million of which was garnered through Selena’s YouTube channel),” Launchmetrics said in the report.Sephora’s partnership with HausLabs also drove significant MIV for the period. “The second top-performing celebrity voice was Lady Gaga, whose brand mentions in reference to HausLabs generated $2.5 million in MIV across 18 placements,” Launchmetrics said. “The top placement mentioning the brand garnered Sephora $394,000 in MIV.

Urban Decay ranked as the top partner voice, generating $5.1 million in MIV.”With partner voices, Ariana Grande mentioning Ulta Beauty in reference to her song, God Is A Woman, boosted the brand’s MIV. “The top performing celebrity voice was Ariana Grande, whose five placements accumulated $2 million in MIV for the brand,” Launchmetrics said in the report. “The top placement by Ariana mentioning Ulta Beauty in reference to God Is A Woman was worth $946,000 in MIV.”And the partnership with Tresluce Beauty also drove up MIV. Launchmetrics said the second top-performing celebrity “was Becky G, whose social placements garnered the brand $1 million in MIV.

The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. Amid the surging inflation, low-to-middle-income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers.This Issaquah, WA-based company stands to benefit from its ability to draw traffic via strategic pricing, a robust membership model and the increasing penetration of the e-commerce business. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering impressive sales numbers.Net sales increased 10.1% to $21.46 billion for the retail month of September from $19.50 billion last year. This followed an increase of 11.4% in August and 10.8% in July. Comparable sales for September jumped 8.5% following increases of 10.1% and 10% in August and July, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCostco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. To drive its online sales, the company launched grocery delivery services in collaboration with Uber Technologies in July 2021. These services allow members to get their on-demand groceries delivered within hours through Uber and Uber Eats mobile apps.Also, Costco’s acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics, boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. We note that comparable e-commerce sales rose 0.7% in September. This followed increases of 3.9% and 10.2% in August and July, respectively.Wrapping UpInflationary pressure across a range of products is pinching consumers, who are now flocking to discount stores to cope with the same. The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players, such as Costco, draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices.We believe a growing customer base and high renewal rates should fuel sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 8.4% and 10.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have appreciated about 4.4% against the industry’s decline of 4.6%.Story continues3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Ulta Beauty ULTA, Dillard's DDS and Kroger KR.Ulta Beauty, which operates as a retailer of beauty products, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Vertex Pharmaceuticals as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 63% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 44% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.8% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

384,98fa4f1a-282a-3147-bb2c-55ceeea19af1,VRTX,2022-10-12,Vertex Advances Program Targeting Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-advances-program-targeting-alpha-120000748.html,1665489600,STORY,['VRTX'],"[- Initiates first-in-human trial of next-wave AAT corrector, VX-634 -- Phase 2 study evaluating the impact of longer-term treatment with VX-864 to be initiated in the coming weeks -- Additional AAT correctors to enter the clinic starting in 2023 -BOSTON, October 11, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today announced the advancement of its investigational program targeting alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a rare, genetic disease characterized by a protein folding defect that can lead to liver and lung disease.Vertex announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for VX-634 enabling the company to initiate a first-in-human clinical trial for this small molecule AAT corrector in healthy volunteers. VX-634 is the first in a series of next-wave molecules under investigation with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties compared to previous Vertex AAT correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response.Additionally, Vertex will initiate a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver, as well as the resultant levels of functional AAT (fAAT) in the plasma. The hypothesis that VX-864 may clear liver polymer stems from recently concluded exploratory analyses from the original 28-day Phase 2 study, which showed VX-864 treatment reduced levels of Z-polymer in the blood of AATD patients by an average of approximately 90% from baseline by day 28 at the highest dose. The previous Phase 2 study of VX-864 showed the AAT corrector was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated proof-of-mechanism, with increases in fAAT in the plasma over the 28-day study period. However, the magnitude of treatment effect was insufficient to advance it to pivotal development. In addition, the prior Phase 2 study did not address the effects of VX-864 therapy on the levels of liver polymer, an important clinical endpoint. The current study is being conducted to determine if longer-term treatment with VX-864 will result in liver polymer clearance and, if so, whether longer term treatment might also result in greater increases in plasma fAAT levels.Story continues""AATD is a serious disease aligned to our research and development strategy, and we remain committed to developing transformative small molecule medicines for patients with AATD with the aim of addressing both the liver and lung manifestations of this disease,"" said David Altshuler, M.D., Ph.D., Vertex’s Executive Vice President, Global Research, and Chief Scientific Officer. ""By simultaneously advancing new, more potent molecules into the clinic and assessing the impact of longer-duration treatment, we expect to have both the assets and the data necessary to progress our AAT corrector program in 2023.""Consistent with its portfolio approach for all programs, Vertex is bringing forward additional next-wave AAT correctors, with the next molecules expected to enter the clinic starting in 2023.About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin DeficiencyAATD is a rare, genetic disease characterized by a protein folding defect which can lead to liver and lung disease. AATD is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes the AAT protein. In the most common form of AATD, which occurs in people with a PiZZ genotype, these changes to SERPINA1 cause the body to produce misfolded AAT protein that gets trapped inside the liver, where most AAT is made. This leads to low levels of AAT protein in the blood. Low blood levels of AAT can allow inflammation to proceed unchecked and damage the lungs. The accumulation of defective AAT in the liver can also lead to liver disease. There is currently no cure for AATD. There are also no treatments that target the underlying protein folding defect that is the cause of the disease.About VX-634VX-634 is an investigational small molecule that promotes proper folding of Z-AAT protein and is being evaluated for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. VX22-634-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, single and multiple-ascending dose study of VX-634 in healthy participants. The key endpoints will be safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VX-634.About the VX-864 Phase 2 48-Week Study in People With AATDThis is a Phase 2, 48-week open-label study of the efficacy and safety of VX-864 in approximately twenty participants with AATD and the PiZZ genotype. All participants will receive 500 mg of VX-864 every 12 hours for 48 weeks and undergo periodic clinical assessments. Ten participants will undergo a liver biopsy before receiving VX-864 and will undergo a second liver biopsy at either Week 24 or Week 48. The primary endpoint will be the mean change from baseline in blood levels of functional alpha-1 antitrypsin at Week 48.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF.

With economies reopening, CCEP’s operations are experiencing strong volume growth, as well as favorable pricing. Specifically, the reopening of the away-from-home channel in Europe has been robust, with several markets reaching or exceeding 2019 volume levels. Additionally, product innovation, such as the compact Freestyle drinks dispenser for small sites, remains a priority for the company, and we believe it will aid in capturing market share over time.

Now, that has piqued the interest of Sozzi ahead of Coca-Cola's earnings release. That's gonna be on October 25. That's where we find his take today. Sozz.BRIAN SOZZI: That's what we do here. We find obscure-- otherwise obscure conferences, like the National Convenience Store Conference, and like bring these reports to life. So shout out to Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein, which put together a report of what Coca-Cola did there. It looks like Robert went to the event. It was well, well-trafficked.Let's fire off some photos here because you're looking, I think, at the next generation of Coca-Cola in many respects. You're seeing a smart coffee machine on screen right now. That is a new Costa brand that they bought a couple of years ago.You're seeing them also innovate more with new cans. You're seeing now that Coke Freestyle machine up to now 208 different flavor options there. And then one of my faves right here, the Body Armor brand, which Coke bought, now coming in 28-ounce bottles with 140 milligrams of caffeine. Sign me up for all that stuff.So again, I think you're seeing a more focused Coca-Cola right here. Really starting to bring or crank up its innovation engine into next year. Now, why is all of this important? Why should we care about what's happening at the National Convenience Store Conference , as it pertains to Coca-Cola?Well, a couple of stats on the board here. Convenience stores account for about 10% to 14% of Coke's North America sales. Convenience stores account for about 15% to 20% of Coke's North America profits, a large presence there, of course. And approximately half of the US adult population shops each day at a convenience store and likely buy something from Coca-Cola, and of course its main rival PepsiCo, which will be getting their earnings out tomorrow morning.Story continuesOverall, speaking of earnings, Coca-Cola will report earnings in a couple of weeks. I whipped up a nifty checklist here for you guys to store away as you prepare for this earnings report.The strong dollar may hammer sales and profits, of course. Coca-Cola is a global player, and they will very much likely to be exposed to that strong dollar, just like we heard from Nike a couple of weeks ago when they reported.Constellation Brands-- we just talked to CEO Bill Newlands-- their earnings were strong. Suggests that increased mobility might have helped Coca-Cola as well. Our price increase is sticking. We saw from Conagra when they reported earnings, and McCormick last week, food companies are pushing through price increases. And for right now, they appear to be sticking. Good thing for margins.And last but not least, any signs of inflation rolling over. I mentioned that Conagra report last week. There were signs that inflation was starting to cool down a little bit. And my take here, more focused Coca-Cola is ultimately a good things for investors into next year.There I am holding a full calorie Coca-Cola. Now, what you don't see here is really over the past year or so, James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, has really streamlined that product portfolio, really got them focused on what they should be doing, which is a Body Armor, which is [? Quirka-Cola, ?] which is unique cans. And not selling things, I believe, like Tab that nobody really wants.BRAD SMITH: What's remarkable is that we always had been talking about for years when there was kind of a war on sugar, if you will, and some of the more sugary drinks that were falling out of the consumer either diet, or fanfare, or just the affinity to those high-sugary drinks.Coca-Cola pivoted. Coca-Cola is one of the only companies that has the amount of cash possible to really deploy in the beverage space to either build something out in-house or go out and acquire a brand. And I think that's really been a really good competitive positioning for them.Of course, it does come with the size of Coca-Cola to make that possible. But that's a significant consideration for how they've been able to kind of steer the ship over these past few years, as consumer tastes trends change.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, it's interesting to see that chart we were just showing, how Coca-Cola shares have been outperforming PepsiCo. But again, we'll hear about them tomorrow. We'll be talking to CFO Hugh Johnston, a friend of our programming. Very curious to see how they did in this volatile backdrop.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Stryker The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StrykerOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the VP &amp; CFO, Glenn Boehnlein, for US$606k worth of shares, at about US$261 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$211). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Stryker didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Stryker insiders own about US$8.7b worth of shares (which is 11% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Stryker Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Stryker insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Be aware that Stryker is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

SDG&amp;E has been rapidly expanding its energy storage portfolio. The company has about 95 MW of utility-owned energy storage currently available, with another 200+ MW in development.""Innovations like storage and microgrids are vital to building a more resilient electric grid that can extend the availability of renewable energy into peak demand hours and better prepare communities to manage through emergencies,"" said SDG&amp;E Vice President of Energy Innovation Miguel Romero.During last month’s heatwave, energy storage, in addition to energy conservation efforts, helped California avoid rotating outages. California has increased investment in energy storage since 2020 and the state now has close to 4,000 MW of batteries. These batteries provided an estimated 4% of the electricity supply during peak demand to help avert rotating outages. Within SDG&amp;E’s service territory, utility-scale battery storage systems – utility and third party-owned – served as much as 7% of the regional load during peak hours of the heatwave.""Extreme weather events, like the recent record heatwave, require our region to strengthen our emergency preparedness and resiliency,"" said San Diego City Councilmember Raul Campillo (District 7). ""Investing in innovative clean energy technology like the Tierrasanta Microgrid will bolster public safety while also bringing economic opportunity to local, family-owned businesses.""Story continuesMicrogrids are small-scale grids that can operate independent of or parallel to the larger regional grid will also help keep critical community facilities powered during unexpected outages. Once complete, the Elliott Microgrid will have the ability to power Fire Station 39, the Tierrasanta Public Library/Cool Zone, Tierrasanta Medical Center, Jean Farb Middle School, Canyon Hills High School, and Tierrasanta and Kumeyaay Elementary Schools.Construction of the Fallbrook energy storage facility has been completed, and the facility is undergoing testing to be connected to the state energy market so the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) can dispatch these resources as needed to balance energy supply and demand throughout the state. The Fallbrook facility will be able to store a total of 40 MW of energy or enough to energize 25,000 homes.Battery storage works by capturing renewable resources like wind and solar when they are abundant during the day, then sending that energy back to the grid when it is needed, such as at night when the sun has set or when energy supply is tight during hot summer months.SDG&amp;E is an innovative San Diego-based energy company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties.

Sempra (SRE), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This natural gas and electricity provider has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.27%.For the most recent quarter, Sempra was expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share, but it reported $1.98 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.79%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.86 per share, while it actually produced $2.91 per share, a surprise of 1.75%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Sempra. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Sempra currently has an Earnings ESP of +21.54%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.65% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.12%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.03%.Coming into today, shares of the industrial conglomerate had lost 13.73% in the past month. In that same time, the Conglomerates sector lost 10.55%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.07%.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Electric as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.51, down 10.53% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $19.04 billion, up 3.29% from the year-ago period.GE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.74 per share and revenue of $75.89 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +29.25% and +2.38%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. General Electric is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note General Electric's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.74. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.53, which means General Electric is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesInvestors should also note that GE has a PEG ratio of 3.39 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Diversified Operations was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.55 at yesterday's closing price.The Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, which puts it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Make sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This funding will enable the organization to launch a pilot program in 50 school districts across Minnesota, North Carolina and Florida to better serve youth mental health at the middle school level for the first time.This new partnership will address key findings from the United Health Foundation’s 2022 America’s Health Rankings Health of Women and Children Report. Released today, the report reveals sharp increases in youth mental health challenges:Anxiety among children ages 3-17 increased 23% between 2017-2018 and 2020-2021. In 2020-2021, anxiety affected roughly 5.6 million children ages 3-17 — an increase of more than 1 million children since 2017-2018.Depression among children ages 3-17 increased 27% between 2017-2018 and 2020-2021. In 2020-2021, depression affected roughly 2.5 million children ages 3-17, an increase of over a half a million more children than in 2017-2018.The teen suicide rate increased 29% at the national level between 2012-2014 and 2018-2020 among 15- to 19-year-olds.""Many mental health disorders can start by age 14, so it’s critical that we provide promotion, prevention, and early intervention strategies to equip younger adolescents with the necessary tools and coping skills to proactively manage and care for their mental health,"" said Alison Malmon, executive director and founder of Active Minds. ""Just like many other illnesses, mental health promotion strategies can be powerful tools for helping young people thrive.""Story continuesFunding from the United Health Foundation will enable Active Minds to address these challenges. Building on Active Minds’ evidence-based approach to improving the mental health of college and high school students, the pilot program will address middle school students’ social and emotional needs, improve attitudes related to mental health, decrease stigma, and increase a student’s likelihood to help a friend with mental health challenges. Following the pilot, Active Minds plans to launch middle school programming nationwide.""Our young people are the future of healthy, strong communities. We look forward to helping youth gain skills to help counter the alarming increases we are seeing in youth mental health,"" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer, UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual.

Meanwhile, our estimate suggests EPS of $5.49 in the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $80.7 billion, suggesting 11.6% growth from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate indicates total revenues of $80.5 billion for the third quarter.Earnings Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth Group boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.66%. This is depicted in the chart below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for UnitedHealth Group this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: UnitedHealth Group has an Earnings ESP of +0.35% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $5.47 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UNH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to NoteUnitedHealth Group’s revenues are likely to have benefited on the back of higher premiums in the third quarter. Premiums are expected to have witnessed a rise, thanks to membership growth on well-devised Medicare and Medicaid plans that UNH distributes through the UnitedHealthcare business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total premiums of UnitedHealth Group is pegged at $63.9 billion, indicating 12.2% year-over-year growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total premiums is $64 billion.The consensus mark for two revenue components, products and services, is pegged at $9.6 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. Both the figures indicate year-over-year improvements of around 11%.Story continuesContinued solid performances by UNH’s two businesses — UnitedHealthcare and Optum — are likely to have contributed to the overall quarterly performance. An increase in the number of individuals served by community-based and senior offerings and, domestic commercial benefit offerings coupled with contract wins might have contributed to the UnitedHealthcare segment’s third-quarter performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the UnitedHealthcare segment is pegged at $62.2 billion (indicating 11.3% growth year over year), while our estimate indicates the segment’s revenues to be $62.3 billion.Coming to the Optum business, its performance is likely to have benefited from an increase in patients catered to via value-based care arrangements, solid contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, continued expansion of pharmacy care services and solid information technology and data analytics offerings suite.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter operating income of the Optum unit stands at $3.6 billion, which indicates a rise of 18.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Meanwhile, our estimate for Optum’s third-quarter operating income matches the consensus mark.The bottom line of UnitedHealth Group is likely to have suffered from escalating expenses resulting from continuous investments to boost capabilities.

Regency Centers’ REG portfolio of premium shopping centers in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas with strong growth drivers is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. Also, an encouraging development pipeline and balance-sheet strength bode well.Analysts seem bullish on this Jacksonville, FL-based Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased 1.8% over the past two months to $3.96.Shares of REG have lost 10.3% in the past three months, narrower than the industry's decline of 11.7%. Given its robust fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead. Hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes Regency Centers a Solid Pick?Solid Industry Fundamentals: Regency’s premium shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near the urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. With more people moving into the suburbs due to post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is likely to benefit as the best-in-class operators are opening new locations in high-quality centers.Focus on Grocery-Anchored Shopping Centers: REG’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. Its portfolio comprises 80% of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.Also, its portfolio has a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers. Of the top 10 tenants, six are high-performing grocers. This assures a stable revenue generation for the company.Acquisitions &amp; Development: To enhance its portfolio, REG has been making acquisitions and developments in key markets of the United States. From the beginning of 2022 through Jun 30, 2022, the company’s buyouts totaled $171 million (at Regency’s share), encompassing 772,000 gross leasable area.Moreover, in second-quarter 2022, it commenced more than $50 million of development and redevelopment projects and completed redevelopment projects with combined costs of approximately $12 million, each at the company’s share. Given its prudent financial management, REG is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Regency maintains a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity and a low leverage level. As of Jun 30, 2022, it had full capacity under its $1.2-billion revolving credit facility and a pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio of 5.0.Also, its investment grade credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 with stable outlooks from S&amp;P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, REG is well-poised to carry forward with its expansionary efforts.REG’s current cash flow growth is projected at 31.83% compared with the 26.69% growth estimated for the industry. Moreover, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 7.40% compared with the industry’s average of 6.13%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Regency remains committed to that. Since 2014, this retail REIT has steadily increased its dividend payments and continued with its payments even during the pandemic.REG has increased its dividend four times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 2.94%. Considering its solid operating platform and solid balance-sheet strength, the company is likely to maintain its dividend payout in the forthcoming quarters.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Kimco Realty KIM, Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and SITE Centers Corp. SITC.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kimco Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 1.3% over the past two months to $1.56.

EL. The leading skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care product provider’s presence in emerging markets is impressive.That being said, The Estee Lauder Companies is grappling with higher costs and supply chain-related issues. Let’s discuss this further.Strength in Skin Care BusinessThe Estee Lauder Companies boasts a solid Skin Care portfolio, which has been aiding growth. In May 2021, The Estee Lauder Companies expanded its Skin Care business when it concluded the first phase of raising its ownership stake in DECIEM Beauty Group Inc. (DECIEM). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, its skin care category was most impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia-Pacific during the back half of fiscal 2022. Keeping this in mind, it delivered solid results as an impressive performance from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown mitigated pressures from other brands in the division.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from a strong online business. The company has been implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for each store appointment, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services. These initiatives and its digital-first mindset have been aiding the company’s online sales. For fiscal 2022, the online channel grew mid-single-digits organically, fueled by double-digit growth across Asia-Pacific. DECIEM’s high online penetration boosted sales growth across the channel.The company has a strong presence in emerging markets, which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. It is investing in catering to consumer demand in China and Asia. EL bought Korea-based skincare brand Dr. Jart in 2019. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that its Shanghai innovation lab is set to open in fiscal 2023. Investing in China will increase its ability to serve Chinese and Asian consumers with locally-relevant innovation. In addition, the center will support the company’s East to West innovation mindset. Also, the company will start limited production in its new production facility near Tokyo during fiscal 2023.Story continuesHurdles on WayIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, The Estee Lauder Companies’ gross margin contracted 370 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 levels, mainly due to factors affecting the supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and increased costs for ocean and air transport put increased pressure on the cost of goods.As The Estee Lauder Companies enters fiscal 2023, it witnesses record inflation, supply chain disruptions, unfavorable currency rates and the risk of a slowdown in several markets worldwide. Management expects first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales to be affected by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects net sales to decline 10-8% year over year. The guidance includes adverse impacts from termination of certain license agreements, the adverse impact associated with Russia and Ukraine and unfavorable currency translations. Quarterly adjusted earnings per share (EPS) earnings are anticipated to decline 34-28% at constant currency.That being said, The Estee Lauder Companies’ upsides are likely to offer respite.Shares of EL have dropped 11.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 14.2% decline.Some Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked consumer staple stocks are e.l.f.

TORONTO, Oct. 12, 2022 /CNW/ - A new survey by ADP Canada, conducted with Maru Public Opinion, reveals that while many working Canadians report feeling engaged and satisfied in the workplace, they also have trouble setting boundaries between work and personal life.ADP Canada Co. (CNW Group/ADP Canada Co.)Job satisfaction masking employee burnout The survey indicates that job satisfaction in the workplace continues to remain relatively high, with seven-in-ten (67%) of Canadian workers responding that they feel satisfied in the workplace.While this is positive news for employers, the survey finds areas of concern that employers should not dismiss when it comes to boundaries and work-life balance. According to the survey, over a third (34%) of respondent's report feeling that they are not able to set boundaries at work when it comes to preserving their work-life balance. As a result, 32 per cent of respondent's report feeling tired or overworked at work, posing concerns on a correlation between boundaries and burnout.This sentiment was the most apparent amongst surveyed Canadians aged 18-34, with 23 per cent reporting working long hours on a regular basis and over four-in-ten (43%) struggling to set work-life boundaries.""As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, where lines between work and our personal lives were blurred for many who worked from home, it will be important for employers to continue building a mindful and supportive work environment that provides employees with regular opportunities to discuss their priorities and encourages them to feel comfortable setting boundaries,"" says Ed Yuen, Vice President, Strategy and HR Outsourcing at ADP Canada.Employer proactivity: Key to employee engagement and wellbeingAlthough Canadian workers report feeling engaged at work, there is still an opportunity to provide additional support. Almost three-in-ten (29%) of respondents feel they have not been provided with the support, tools and resources to advance their careers.Story continuesThat said, Canadian organizations are being proactive and understand the importance of frequently checking in on employees to discuss goals and feedback, with four-in-ten (40%) working Canadians surveyed reporting that they receive weekly check-ins from their management.""It's encouraging to see that employers are prioritizing weekly check-ins. Not only do check-ins help to identify potential issues early on, but they also provide employers with the opportunity to support their employees and help raise capacity or fatigue issues,"" added Yuen.In addition to check-ins, Canadian workers indicate their feedback is taken into consideration: more than half (53%) of respondents report that their goals, feedback and expectations are taken seriously by their employer in the workplace.""Now, more than ever, employers should encourage employees to disconnect from work and set boundaries, while also providing them with the right support and resources to manage their work-life balance and achieve their career goals,"" concluded Yuen.Survey MethodologyThese are some of the findings of a survey undertaken by Maru Public Opinion from September 12-13, 2022, of 748 randomly selected employed Canadian adults who are Maru Voice Canada online panelists.

411,208b253f-9df7-3df2-91c2-ba54c59aa5ba,PG,2022-10-12,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as The Procter & Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) recent 4.5% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-110100157.html,1665572460,STORY,['PG'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 65% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$295b last week after a 4.5% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 10% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Procter &amp; Gamble, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Procter &amp; Gamble, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Procter &amp; Gamble does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Procter &amp; Gamble, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Procter &amp; Gamble is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$203m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 35% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

If you want to see some more of the valuable companies, go directly to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow indices have experienced a significant dip since the start of 2022, providing attractive investment opportunities to long-term investors. Jeremy Siegel, a renowned finance professor at Wharton Business School, believes that some of the best long-term stocks are trading at very cheap valuations in the market currently. He believes that the raging inflation, hovering around a four-decade high, can be expected to come under control as the housing market is cooling down. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government has increased the money supply by 40%, and historically, earnings have increased with an expansion in the money supply. Mr. Siegel observed that, at one point, numerous established stocks saw a surge of 50% to 55% compared to their levels before the pandemic. However, the recent weakness in the stock market has pulled back these gains to around 20% only, bringing down the valuation of companies.It is widely believed that the majority of the wealth created in the stock market is due to the success of the best long-term stocks, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A study conducted at the business school of Arizona State University concluded that over 55% of the stocks listed in the US and 57% of the stocks listed in other leading stock markets globally underperformed in comparison to the relative performance of risk-free US Treasury bonds during the three-decade period between 1990 and 2020. Meanwhile, over $75 trillion of the global wealth created in the stock markets was due to the strong performance of only 2.4% of the stocks listed on these exchanges. This makes it necessary to undertake careful research to identify the best long-term stocks and avoid underperforming stocks that are in the majority.Story continuesPhoto by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur Methodology We have shortlisted the best long-term stocks after looking into the past performance of these companies and the future prospects being offered.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019.

(NYSE:JPM) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon. Inflationary expectations are only now working themselves into the labor market with historically low unemployment, resurgent labor unions, and higher wages. These labor cost pressures are only starting to show up in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent Producer Price Index showed a +9% year over year increase, the highest since it was created in 2010. Higher input prices generally lead to rising consumer prices.“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon.” Consumer balance sheets are in excellent shape with lower unemployment and banked stimulus checks. A recent analysis from JP Morgan Chase (JPM) showed average checking accounts have 50% higher balances than pre-Covid. The U.S. money supply as measured by M2 (a calculation that includes cash, checking accounts, and “near cash” such as money market securities) is up +38% versus year-end 2019. Higher consumer cash holdings and higher money supply mean more spending and demand for goods. Some emphasize supply issues to explain current inflation. Going forward, we see very strong demand as well, too much money chasing too few goods.”In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc.

The Texas-based carrier, however, did not provide any commentary on the booking trends.Airline fares were up 33% year-on-year in August and have been one of the biggest contributors to a jump in U.S. consumer prices.With the Federal Reserve aggressively raising interest rates to tame inflation by lowering demand and slowing economic growth, the industry's pricing power is under threat.Analysts at Jefferies expect a sharp slowdown in the industry's revenue next year.""We struggle to get positive on a pricing story when the Fed is actively targeting airline fares as a component of inflation,"" they said in a note.Those worries have led to a 38% decline in the NYSE Arca Airline index this year, taking the focus away from what is shaping up to be the industry's best earnings performance in three years.Daniel McKenzie, an analyst at Seaport Research Partners, last month cut 2023 earnings estimates for major carriers after the Fed delivered a third straight 75 basis-point interest rate hike.Carriers have been playing down demand concerns, saying there has been no slowdown in post-summer travel bookings.Travel demand tends to cool after Labor Day, which marks the unofficial end of the U.S. summer season. But airlines say travel bookings, thus far, have been resilient.Story continuesAfter surpassing 2019 levels during last month's Labor Day holiday weekend, U.S. passenger traffic has been averaging about 92% of the pre-pandemic levels since the first week of September, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.Reopening of borders as well as a strong U.S. dollar are encouraging more Americans to travel overseas, driving up the demand for international flights.Delta Air Lines Inc, which is due to report earnings on Thursday, has plans to operate more transatlantic flights this month than in October 2019.It is not clear, however, if the demand will sustain. Britain's biggest airport, Heathrow, on Tuesday warned of a possible slowdown in travel demand this winter.As companies call their employees back to office, business travel demand has received a boost. Still, a full-scale recovery in corporate travel - the industry's cash cow - is not in sight.The Global Business Travel Association does not expect corporate spending to rebound to pre-pandemic levels before 2026 due to macroeconomic concerns.Prior to the pandemic, business travel accounted for up to 50% of the U.S airline industry's passenger revenue, according to trade group Airlines for America.""We're looking at business travel,"" Christopher Raite, senior analyst at Third Bridge, said. ""That's really the key.""(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Anna Driver and Matthew Lewis)]"

The system serves nearly 15,000 customers over 32.5 square miles, including the City of Butler; Butler and Center townships; East Butler Borough; and parts of Connoquenessing Borough, Summit and Oakland townships, and a small portion of Penn Township. Pennsylvania American Water is already the drinking water service provider to approximately 19,500 customers in the region, and its predecessor companies have served the Butler area since the late 1800s.""We are pleased that BASA and other community leaders recognized the value we provide to our water customers and are entrusting us with the future ownership of their wastewater system,"" said Pennsylvania American Water President Mike Doran. ""This agreement was achieved through a collaborative process between all parties and tailored to meet the specific needs of residents, BASA employees, and infrastructure of the wastewater system. Pennsylvania American Water is well positioned to step in and assume responsibility for the community’s wastewater needs by using the existing expertise of current employees, leveraged by the resources we can provide as the Commonwealth’s largest water and wastewater utility. We are confident that this proposal offers the best long-term solution for BASA, its customers, the City of Butler and Butler Township.""As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will offer employment to all of BASA’s employees, maintain the existing BASA operations center for a minimum of 10 years, assume BASA’s planned capital improvement projects utilizing qualified Butler area contractors, and adopt BASA’s rates at closing with a minimum 1-year rate freeze. The company will also petition the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) for approval to initiate a pilot program allowing the company to replace broken customer sewer laterals.Story continues""Since the beginning of this process, our board prioritized the needs of our employees and customers,"" said Paul Sybert, Chairman of BASA’s Board of Directors. ""Without BASA’s dedicated and hardworking employees, this facility would not run. They, and our customers, always remained at the forefront of our minds. This acquisition is the right decision, and we are confident that the upcoming months will bring forward a seamless transition as we continue to work with Pennsylvania American Water.""Upon taking ownership, Pennsylvania American Water will make necessary treatment and collection system upgrades to improve the wastewater system, which are expected to total more than $75 million. Specifically, the company plans to make significant investments in improving and replacing pump stations, making electrical, safety and treatment improvements at the treatment plant, conducting a systemwide infiltration &amp; inflow assessment, conducting a systemwide inspection and cleaning of sewer collection mains and manholes, and replacing certain sewer mains, among other projects.""We spent a lot of time analyzing how this acquisition would impact our community,"" said Butler Township Commissioner President Dave Zarnick. ""As infrastructure ages, it becomes more costly to maintain and repair. Pennsylvania American Water has vast resources and is equipped to make the $75 million in improvements that the BASA’s facility requires. We hosted several open houses that enabled us to solicit feedback from residents, and while some had questions, many I talked to were in support of this sale. Our residents should remain confident and know that they will receive the highest quality wastewater services from Pennsylvania American Water.""The City of Butler and Butler Township, as the sole owners of BASA, will receive the proceeds from this proposed sale. Both municipalities are proposing to use the proceeds of the sale to support essential services for residents, meet future financial obligations, and make various other community improvements.""We have done our due diligence and we are firmly united,"" said City of Butler Mayor Bob Dandoy. ""For nearly an entire year, we looked at every aspect of what this sale would mean to those in BASA’s service territory. From Pennsylvania American Water’s commitment to petition the PUC for approval on a lateral pilot program to a one-year rate freeze to low-income customers having the ability to access the company’s grant programs—our residents are the ones who will reap the extensive benefits that this acquisition provides.""Pennsylvania American Water will seek all necessary approvals from its regulators and expects to close the transaction by the end of 2023.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.03%.Heading into today, shares of the mining company had lost 9.05% over the past month, lagging the Basic Materials sector's loss of 8.56% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 11.07% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Freeport-McMoRan as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 20, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Freeport-McMoRan to post earnings of $0.40 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 55.06%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.41 billion, down 11.05% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.56 per share and revenue of $23.03 billion. These totals would mark changes of -18.21% and +0.83%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Freeport-McMoRan. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Mining Stocks To Buy Now.Mining Industry Analysis: Projections and RisksThe mining sector has been a traditional hedge against inflation. Commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster amid geopolitical unrest, rising inflation, and high interest rates. According to an industry analysis report by Research and Markets, the global mining industry was valued at $1.8 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach a value of $2 trillion in 2022. Moving forward, the global mining industry is poised to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% through 2026 and reach a valuation of $3.35 trillion. While these numbers look promising, the mining industry is faced with a multitude of challenges. According to KPMG's 2022 Mining Outlook, some of the top priority risks that the mining industry is being faced with in 2022 include ESG regulations, political instability, supply chain issues, and a global trade conflict among others. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its escalation is impacting the global commodities market and the London Metal Exchange is considering placing sanctions on Russian metals. Russia is a major producer and exporter of aluminum, copper, steel, and nickel.A Potential Mining SupercycleWhile the near-term outlook for the mining sector is somewhat cloudy and bleak, some analysts see the mining industry heading into a supercycle over the next couple of years. TD Securities Managing Director and Head of Mining Equity Research, Greg Barnes, appeared in an interview on MoneyTalk where he shared his insights and outlook for the mining sector. Greg Barnes thinks that though a slowing global economy, high inflation, high interest rates, and a strong dollar are putting pressure on commodity prices, the long-term supply and demand trends for metals favor the probability of a mining supercycle. Greg Barnes said that mining projects are ""difficult to build and very expensive"" and that in the near term he expects headwinds for the sector and supply constraints. However, in the long term, he thinks ""the stage is being set"" for a ""potential super cycle"" primarily driven by an increase in demand for battery metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium.Story continuesThe mining sector has been taking a beating in 2022, and some of the best-in-class miners are beaten down to bargain levels.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection to treat Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. The target action date for the FDA decision is February 11, 2023.ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Each year in the U.S., between 1,100 to 1,500 infants develop disease severe enough to require medical treatment. The rare eye disease often impacts infants who are born before 31 weeks of pregnancy have been completed or who weigh less than 1,500 grams (3.3 lbs) pounds at birth. As retinal blood vessels are often only fully developed when an infant is full-term (~9 months of pregnancy), these infants are at risk of developing retinal blood vessels that are abnormal (retinal neovascularization) potentially leading to retinal detachment and irreversible vision loss. Mild cases of ROP may get better without treatment, but some cases require treatment (for which the current standard of care is laser photocoagulation) to keep ROP from causing significant visual impairment and even blindness.The sBLA is supported by data from two randomized global Phase 3 trials – FIREFLEYE (N=113) and BUTTERFLEYE (N=120) – investigating EYLEA 0.4 mg versus laser photocoagulation (laser) in infants with ROP. In both trials, approximately 80% of EYLEA-treated infants achieved an absence of both active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 52 weeks of age, although their primary endpoint of non-inferiority was not met due to laser demonstrating comparable levels of efficacy that were higher than what have been historically observed in similar ROP trials. Notably, per an exploratory analysis, the time required to complete treatment administration per patient was considerably less for EYLEA than for laser (FIREFLEYE: 4 minutes versus 122 minutes; BUTTERFLEYE: 11 minutes versus 129 minutes).Story continuesNo new EYLEA safety signals were observed in either trial. Comparing EYLEA to laser, ocular adverse events (AEs) among patients occurred in 39% versus 37% in FIREFLEYE and 18% versus 26% in BUTTERFLEYE, with serious ocular AEs occurring in 8% for both groups in FIREFLEYE and 6.5% versus 11% in BUTTERFLEYE. AEs in both trials were consistent with infant prematurity or to the injection procedure, and with the AEs in similar ROP trials.The results of FIREFLEYE were published in Journal of the American Medical Association, and data from BUTTERFLEYE were recently presented at ROP Update 2022 meeting in the U.S. Both trials were conducted pursuant to FDA Pediatric Written Request, and a Pediatric Exclusivity Determination is under review by FDA with a response expected by early 2023. A Pediatric Exclusivity Determination is granted if the specifications of the Pediatric Written Request are met, regardless of whether a pediatric indication is approved.EYLEA was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ROP in July 2019. The safety and efficacy of EYLEA for the treatment of ROP have not been fully evaluated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for BUTTERFLEYE and Bayer for FIREFLEYE. Bayer and Regeneron are collaborating on the global development of EYLEA. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights of EYLEA in the United States. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA.About EYLEAEYLEA is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. The EYLEA safety and efficacy profile is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 10 years of real-world experience and more than 50 million EYLEA injections globally.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS INDICATIONSEYLEAâ (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).CONTRAINDICATIONS EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About Regeneron Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

In that report, analysts expect Union Pacific to post earnings of $3.07 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 19.46%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.48 billion, up 16.47% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.58 per share and revenue of $25 billion.

Since its inception, the fund has experienced strong long-term performance and currently ranks within the top quintile of Morningstar’s Tactical Allocation category for the 3-, 5- and 15-year periods ending September 30, 2022. Rated overall 5-stars by Morningstar,2 the Columbia Thermostat Fund is designed to provide shareholders with consistent total returns throughout various market environments.The fund follows a systematic, rules-based investment process that rebalances automatically based on the movement of the S&amp;P 500 Index. When the stock market moves higher, the fund rebalances by selling stocks and buying bonds. When the stock market sells off and moves lower, the fund buys stocks and sells bonds.Anwiti Bahuguna, Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Multi-Asset Strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, is lead manager of the fund and credits Ralph Wanger, a renowned investor who launched the fund 20 years ago, with designing the effective strategy. Bahuguna and co-manager Alex Rivas apply Wanger’s systematic investment approach to the fund and, like a thermostat, it’s automated to adapt to the temperature of the market.""What I love most about the fund is that it reflects the pure essence of investing, to buy low and sell high,"" said Bahuguna. ""We’ve found that many investors are tempted to buy as markets get hot and sell as things cool down, which we all know can lead to poor investment outcomes. This fund is designed to take the emotion out of investing by helping investors navigate the market with the goal of long-term total returns.""This approach can be particularly helpful in volatile and down markets as it prevents investors from making impulse decisions. The purpose of the fund is to help investors reach their long-term financial goals and feel financially stable, even when the market seems anything but stable. The fund closely monitors valuations and automatically rebalances based on the level of the S&amp;P 500. Bahuguna and Rivas use a straightforward approach, including a regular annual review process to determine the current market state and set allocation tables. Composed of competitive underlying investments, the fund’s stock and bond allocations can range from 10-90%, moving in 5% increments, depending on market conditions.Story continuesRatings and rankingsTime PeriodOverall1-Year3-Year5-Year10-Year15-YearPercentile Rank63139268# of Peers26025923520912441Star Rating5-stars5-stars5-stars4-starsCategory: Tactical Allocation as of September 30, 2022Ratings and rankings shown for Institutional Share Class.

Read the prospectus carefully before investing.Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. The fund’s investment in other funds subjects it to the investment performance (positive or negative), risks and expenses of these underlying funds. There are risks associated with fixed-income investments, including credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. This effect is more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non- investment-grade (high-yield or junk) securities present greater price volatility and more risk to principal and income than higher rated securities. Foreign investments subject the fund to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging market issuers.Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index: Widely regarded as the best single gauge of the U.S. equities market, this capitalization-weighted index includes a representative sample of 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy.It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.©2022 Morningstar, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Now?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-cisco-systems-inc-110107401.html,1665572467,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$49.37 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$39.58. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$39.58 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Cisco Systems is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 13.77x is currently well-below the industry average of 22.7x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Cisco Systems’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Cisco Systems generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 17% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Cisco Systems from their most recent forecasts.

452,9a2706ed-68b8-3fa3-a24c-867f2b73e7d7,CSCO,2022-10-12,How Cisco Data Scientists Helped CommonLit Innovate Teacher Feedback for Better Learning,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-data-scientists-helped-commonlit-133500150.html,1665495300,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 11, 2022 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureThe Transformational Tech series highlights Cisco's nonprofit grant recipients that use technology to help transform the lives of individuals and communities.Student reading and math comprehension is in decline. The U.S. ""Nations Scorecard,"" based on long term scores, recorded by the National Association of Education Progress (NAEP) and analysis by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NEBR), shows the largest average score decline in reading since 1990, and the first ever score decline in mathematics. This decline comes from analysis of testing data from over two million students in 10,000 schools in 49 states.More can and will be done to address the implications of widening achievement for all students, and in particular students from underserved districts. To stimulate an academic recovery, we need innovative classroom solutions like CommonLit to support teachers and their students in today's classrooms.For years, Cisco nonprofit grantee CommonLit has focused on their mission to help students learn how to be better readers and writers. They've been successful in their approach: by giving students online access to reading materials, assignments, and tests, and through giving teachers resources, like dashboards that show where kids may be struggling with certain skills.""CommonLit offers programs that are fully interactive and have everything teachers and students need-much like a reading program in a box."" Agnes Malatinszky, Chief Operating Officer at CommonLit explains.Their highly engaging Annotation Tool, launched in July 2019, enables teachers to give relevant and real-time feedback to students. But research shows that receiving timely feedback leads to better student outcomes. So, the team at CommonLit wanted to find ways to make their Annotation Tool more effective for teachers to use.So two years ago, with support from the Cisco Foundation, CommonLit came to Cisco's data scientists, who volunteer with AI for Good, to help them review Annotation Tool usage information and determine ways to optimize the Annotation Tool through machine learning (ML) to help teachers and students better connect.Story continuesPartnering up and giving backAt Cisco, we have a proven track record of supporting nonprofits through our strategic social impact grants along with a strong culture of giving back. Cisco's AI for Good program brings these values together by connecting Cisco data science talent to nonprofits, like CommonLit, that do not have the resources to use AI/ML to meet their goals.This CommonLit and AI for Good partnered project was led by data scientist Kirtee Yadav, who also served as cause champion-which means she led the project from start to finish to ensure the project's success. Other members of the project included Technical Lead Sampann Nigam and Team members, William Bickelmann, Bob Lapcevic, Aakriti Saxena, Sree Yadavalli, and Tana Franko.""This CommonLit project was a good opportunity for Cisco's data scientists to help for a good cause by using their unique skills,"" stated Kirtee Yadav, a customer experience product manager at Cisco. ""I jumped on this opportunity because it offered me the chance to learn new skills while I make an impact on this nonprofit.""Finding the gaps through data scienceMultiple studies have shown that the more feedback that kids receive, and the faster they receive it after completing an assignment, the more they will interact and learn from content. Yet many teachers often don't have the time to provide detailed personalized feedback.CommonLit challenged AI for Good data scientists to find out how that issue can be improved or resolved. The first thing the AI for Good team did was look at how Cisco's machine learning models could modify, streamline, or improve the Annotation Tool so teachers could more efficiently give feedback to students. Through results from pulled data, they found that teachers could only provide feedback to an average of two percent of student's comments.""Based on our analysis of the [CommonLit] data,"" Sampann Nigam, data science leader at Cisco and tech lead on the AI for Good team, pointed out, ""we found that feedback from teachers pushes engagement up. So, we created an AI model to recommend feedback options to teachers.""The data science-built solutionAfter months of research and hard work, The AI for Good team built a natural language processing (NLP) solution to help teachers with limited bandwidth give feedback to more students. Through NLP, the improved Annotation application will generate three suggested feedback phrases with the added option of freeform feedback.""The feedback is built to look like teacher's direct feedback, but instead it's a tool that provides feedback options, which teachers can pick and send to students with just a click,"" Kirtee reasoned. ""In the end, AI for Good helped CommonLit improve their student teacher feedback loop.""Sampann described the technical process to us: The AI for Good team built the phrase prediction solution using the BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and free-form feedback prediction, using a T5 model. Data scientists trained (fine-tuned) the BERT model by using the provided data set of annotated texts and student notes as the feature set and the feedback phrases as labels.""Besides generating a set of phrases as suggested feedback, we decided to provide freeform feedback,"" Sampann said. ""These models use transfer learning, a specialized machine learning process.""Proof of successOver one million teachers use CommonLit in more than 80,000 schools. By fall semester of 2019, just months after launch, over 603,000 students had used the Annotation Tool, creating 3,210,156 Annotations and 5,029,973 highlights. So it comes as no surprise that the Annotation Tool, with its newly improved natural language processing, has proven very useful within its first year - close to 2.5 million annotations were logged.""An education technology tool like CommonLit could never replace a classroom teacher, but we can make their time more effective."" Agnes said, ""The way we think about machine learning and natural language processing tools, like what's been developed for the Annotation Tool, is to make the jobs of teachers as easy as possible. We can make their jobs easier. We can nudge them towards best practices.""This data science focused collaboration included a team of ten AI for Good data science volunteers and over 200 hours of their time spent on research, analysis, and problem-solving to successfully build a natural language-informed Annotation Tool.The AI for Good team is working with CommonLit on options for releasing their Feedback recommendation AI model as open source, so that the education community can benefit from it.""Cisco has been a partner for us for a couple of years now. They have supported some of our most innovative work around the technology,"" Agnes explained. ""And working with the Cisco AI for Good team was a unique experience that moved our organization's most cutting-edge work forward.""Learn more about our partnership with CommonLit.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719863/How-Cisco-Data-Scientists-Helped-CommonLit-Innovate-Teacher-Feedback-for-Better-Learning]"

This year's survey highlights the critical need for further transparency as consumers say their top priority is for organizations to be more transparent on how they use their personal data. The survey also showed that while, in theory, consumers are supportive of AI (with 54 percent willing to share their anonymized data to improve AI products), many (65 percent) have lost trust in organizations due to their use of AI.60 percent of respondents expressed concern about how organizations are using their personal data for AI""Organizations need to explain their data practices in simple terms and make them readily available so that customers and users can understand what is going on with their data. It is not just legally required; trust depends on it,"" says Harvey Jang, Cisco Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer.This year, 81 percent of respondents agreed that the way an organization treats personal data is indicative of how it views and respects its customers – the highest percentage since Cisco began tracking it in 2019.Consumers Are Increasingly Taking ActionIn response to the erosion of trust in organizations' ability to protect data, many consumers are taking action to better protect their data themselves including:76 percent say they would not buy from a company who they do not trust with their data37 percent indicated they had indeed switched providers over data privacy practices53 percent say they manage their cookie settings from a website before accepting46 percent of those with a home listening device say they turn it off regularly to protect their privacyStory continuesDisconnect Between Business and Consumers When It Comes to AIEver-evolving technologies make it difficult for consumers to trust companies with their data. Most respondents believe the potential benefits of AI outweigh the risk, provided proper de-identification is in place, with 54 percent willing to share their anonymized personal data to help improve AI-based products and decision-making.However, there is a disconnect between businesses and consumers: while 87 percent of organizations believe they have processes in place to ensure automated decision-making is done in accordance with customer expectations, 60 percent of respondents expressed concern about how organizations are using their personal data for AI. Powerful steps organizations can take to address this include giving consumers the opportunity to opt-out of the AI application and explain how their AI application works.Desire for Government to Play a Primary RoleFinally, more than half said national or local government should play the primary role when it comes to protecting consumers data. Many consumers do not trust private companies to be responsible with personal data on their own accord.As governments and organizations continue to demand protections on data transferred outside their national borders, more are putting in place data localization requirements, demanding data to be physically stored in the country or region where it was collected. Yet data localization comes at a price. The Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study reported that 88 percent of surveyed organizations experience significant additional operational costs due to data localization. Consumers are evenly split on the value of data localization (41 percent in favor, 41 percent against) if it adds cost to the products and services they buy.""We hope that the insights from this survey will motivate organizations to continue to prioritize their customers' desire for security, privacy, and transparency,"" said Brad Arkin, Cisco Senior Vice President, Chief Security and Trust Officer.Additional resources:2022 Cisco Consumer Privacy survey (PDF)InfographicCisco Newsroom: A business imperative: building trust around data Blog by Robert Waitman2022 Cisco Data Privacy Benchmark Cisco Trust CenterCisco Security Report SeriesAbout CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.
