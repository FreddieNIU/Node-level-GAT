Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) share price is down 42% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 1.0%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 14% in three years. Furthermore, it's down 36% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, U.S. Bancorp had to report a 19% decline in EPS over the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 42% share price fall. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 8.36.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 1 year was -39%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in U.S. Bancorp had a tough year, with a total loss of 39% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 1.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp   you should know about.U.S. Bancorp is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) stock is up an impressive 154% over the last five years.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Cintas While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Cintas achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 20% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Cintas, it has a TSR of 169% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Cintas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 22% a year, is even better.

(NYSE:RJF) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 17th of July to $0.42. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.8% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial Raymond James Financial's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Prior to this announcement, Raymond James Financial's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. With the company not bringing in any cash, paying out to shareholders is bound to become difficult at some point.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 32.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendRaymond James Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.347 total annually to $1.68. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Raymond James Financial has grown earnings per share at 18% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Our Thoughts On Raymond James Financial's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Overall, Memorial Day road trips are up 6% from this time last year, which could have something to do with lower prices at the pump.See Our List: 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsRead: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gas was $4.62 per gallon on Memorial Day 2022. As of May 25, the average price is $3.57 — or more than $1 cheaper per gallon.After 2022’s record-high gas prices, will gas prices keep dropping? Let’s find out what the experts think.Why Have Gas Prices Dropped So Much This Year?Last year was a record high for gas prices. The highest recorded average price of gasoline occurred June 14, 2022 — just a couple of weeks after Memorial Day — at $5.01 per gallon. However, according to the Department of Labor, all gasoline prices have fallen 12.2% over the past year. And when filling up at the pump this year for Memorial Day weekend, paying $1.08 per gallon less than a year ago is a significant savings.So why have gas prices dropped so much?“The short answers are that the global oil markets have adjusted to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions AND the weakening global economy due to U.S. and European interest rate increases to slow inflation,” said Ed Hirs, a UH Energy Fellow and an economics lecturer at the University of Houston.Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?What Factors Determine the Price You Pay at the Pump?When asked what factors go into the price of gasoline at the pump, Hirs said, “The cost of crude and cost of refining — and, in the U.S., the switch to summer blends for gasoline.”According to the EIA, taxes and distribution and marketing costs and profits also factor into the price of gasoline.Story continuesThe cost of crude oil makes up the biggest part of the price you pay at the pump, which can vary over time and by different regions of the country. Federal and state taxes make up the next largest share of the gas price, with distribution costs and marketing and refining costs and profits contributing to the rest of the price.Will Gas Prices Keep Dropping Over Time?Because the price of crude oil heavily influences the price of gasoline at the pump, it matters how much it costs per barrel — and that cost fluctuates.“It is apparent that OPEC+ would like the price of crude oil to stay in the $70-to-$75/bbl range,” said Hirs. “That will be the determining factor unless the Russian war on Ukraine spreads.”As of May 23, the price of crude oil is $73.81 per barrel, which is within the aforementioned range. If the Russian war on Ukraine spreads, however, Americans can expect an increase in the prices of gas.Will the Price of Gas Increase During Memorial Day Weekend?Gas prices haven’t moved much over the last week, according to AAA data. And they might hold steady, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.On May 23, De Haan tweeted: “That escalated quickly… our forecast was for the national average to hit $3.53/gal on Memorial Day… welp, we just hit $3.53 thanks to broad hikes in the Great Lakes, but we still could see a $3.53/gal national average on Memorial Day!”What Will Gas Prices Be Like This Summer?Not as high as last summer, hopefully.“I continue to be optimistic that the national average will remain under $4 per gallon for most of, if not the entire summer, with Americans spending a combined $1.6 billion less on gasoline over Memorial Day weekend this year compared to last,” De Haan told various news outlets.How To Save on Gas During the Memorial Holiday WeekendSteve Sexton, CEO of Sexton Advisory Group, said that the day you choose to fill up your gas tank can make an impact on your wallet.“According to a recent report by GasBuddy, the best days of the week to buy gas at lower rates per gallon are Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays,” he said. “If you’re looking to save money ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, plan to fill up your tank this Friday so you don’t have to think about it on the holiday. Other ways to save money on gas include driving at a fuel-efficient speed, ensuring your car gets proper maintenance throughout the year and using a gas price app to find competitive rates in your area.”More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Vote for Your Favorite3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Memorial Day Travel: After 2022’s Record Highs, Will Gas Prices Keep Dropping?]"

With projections showing a potential rise to 35-40% by 2030, surpassing previous estimates of 25-30% made just three years ago, the EV market is poised for substantial growth.As the EV market continues to flourish, investors are eagerly seeking the equivalent of the oil boom in this sector. While lithium and cobalt have received significant attention, with investors pouring funds into companies like Albemarle (ALB) and the Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF (LIT), it is important to note that these commodities are not much different than other resources such as potash or orange juice.What Are Silicon Carbide Chips? Shahar Cohen is the founder of Lucid Capital, a hedge fund specializing in mid-cap stocks that outperformed the Nasdaq by 17% in the past year. Cohen suggests that Silicon Carbide (SiC) chips are the new secret sauce in the EV industry. SiC wafers are a fusion of silicon and carbon, created through a baking process in furnaces with temperatures reaching 2000 degrees Celsius (comparable to the outer surface of the Sun).SiC transistors possess superior power-switching capabilities and lower leakage, while SiC-based inverters enable EVs to charge in as few as 7 minutes, extend their range by 5-10%, and reduce battery size by 10%. ON Semiconductor (ON) predicts that the SiC market will experience a 33% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2030, surpassing the growth rates of CPUs in the 1990s and mobile processors in the 2000s (20% and 18% CAGR, respectively).Story continuesHowever, the production of SiC wafers and chip fabrication is an intricate and complex process that demands expertise and know-how. As the CEO of Wolfspeed (WOLF) highlighted in Q4 2022, “It’s definitely not for the faint of heart. It comes with a lot of challenges.”As a result, the SiC wafers require many steps in the semiconductors fabs. One of the most a crucial steps plays a role in the production of Silicon Carbide (SiC) wafers called Epitaxy. Epitaxy involves the precise deposition of thin layers of materials onto a substrate, creating high-quality crystalline structures with desired properties.Who Makes SiC Chips? According to Cohen, only three companies globally supply epitaxy machines for SiC wafers. One company to watch in this arena is Aixtron (AIXXF), a leading provider of deposition equipment, which has emerged as a key player in epitaxy technology development.Aixtron’s power electronics business, which encompasses SiC and GaN, has experienced significant growth, accounting for 50% of revenues in 2022 compared to 5% in 2018. Shahar Cohen estimates that Aixtron’s revenues in 2023 will reach 620 million Euros, a substantial increase from the 260 million Euros in 2019, which will be largely driven by its SiC Epitaxy machines. With the company implementing price increases and benefiting from economies of scale in production, Aixtron is projected to expand its EBIT margin from 23% in 2021 to 27% in 2024. At 3B Euro valuation currently, the stock trades at a reasonable forward P/E of 18.Analysts Weigh InOn April 27, analysts at Deutsche Bank gave Aixtron a Buy rating for the short-term, saying, “We regard the recent sell-off in Aixtron shares as overdone.” They are pleased to see a high order intake and backlog, and expect to see continued strong orders.Four days ago, Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of AIXXF, but rated it a Hold. Analyst Lee Simpson said he recognizes the growing opportunities for this SiC company, but believes those opportunities have already been priced in, giving little room for upward movement of the stock.SiC Chips – Huge Potential OpportunityIn conclusion, while lithium remains a critical resource in EV production it is still a commodity with little added value. Silicon Carbide (SiC) chips are emerging as a game-changer, offering enhanced performance and enabling significant advancements in EV technology.However, the challenges associated with SiC wafer production and chip fabrication highlight the need for sophisticated “picks and shovels.” Aixtron’s represents a potential opportunity to address the industry’s key bottleneck, positioning itself as a pivotal player in the race towards electrification.]"

Dividend and stable, high-yield stocks offer reasonably predictable income without sacrificing market excitement or capital return opportunity.Although today’s 5.08% Federal Funds rate is closer to the central bank’s stated 5.25% goal, sticky inflation and continued economic concerns mean the rate will likely continue rising or remain elevated even if the pace slows. Rate risk means stocks are still struggling, but signs of recovery are slowly emerging, even as debt-ceiling drama makes the market jittery.It’s no wonder savvy investors are increasingly drawn to equities with a high dividend yield, but investing in income stocks alone isn’t a winning play. Instead, investors must closely examine underlying fundamentals to ensure their picks are the best income stocks for rising interest rates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOmnicom Group (OMC)Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept.Source: weedezign via ShutterstockTTM Yield: 6.35%Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC), a major player in the advertising world, operates under the radar but profoundly impacts your daily consumer experience. Serving industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Omnicom’s impressive adaptation to the digital age means it’s here to stay with plans for Web 3 expansion. This successful transition and continuous innovation hint at sustained growth in an increasingly digitalized global market.Omnicom bolsters a substantial and reliable dividend yield through strategic stock buybacks, reducing the number of shares in circulation and boosting prices for those remaining. Prudently, its management prefers staking excess earnings on improving shareholder positioning instead of speculative expansion in today’s economy. The technique offers an arguably superior return by limiting the tax implications for investors.Story continuesStill, with a payout ratio comfortably under 50%, Omnicom retains a significant cash reserve, empowering it to seize opportunities for expansion and acquisitions in the evolving advertising landscape.A distinguishing feature of Omnicom’s corporate resiliency trajectory is its predominantly organic and grassroots operations rather than a reliance on acquiring smaller companies or merging with rivals. This testifies to the firm’s robust adaptability and potential for future market capture as less well-managed competitors falter when facing higher interest rates.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comTTM Yield: 4.43%The rollercoaster ride of medical stocks during the pandemic understandably created an air of caution among investors. Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT) was not immune, as its share price fell ill compared to its peak during the health crisis. Surprising many, though, Medtronic went off life support and is gradually recovering in 2023.Despite setbacks, the current pricing offers an income antidote when viewed in conjunction with Medtronic’s steadfast commitment to its dividend program. The firm has a nearly five-decade history of consistent dividend increases. Additionally, the CFO pledged a return of at least half its free cash flow to shareholders through 2023.As a recognized innovator and medical device industry leader, Medtronic capitalizes on its innovative culture to engage in cooperative, risk-based agreements with hospital networks. These partnerships aim to enhance patient outcomes and curb healthcare costs, making Medtronic an appealing collaborator in a climate of escalating healthcare expenses. This strategy and its continuous technological advancements suggest that Medtronic could be poised for future growth while maintaining its status as a top income stock today. Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockTTM Yield: 4.96%Income-focused investors should also consider Realty Income (NYSE:O), a real estate investment trust (REIT) widely known as the “monthly dividend company.” Its commitment to delivering monthly dividends makes it a unique proposition in an uncertain market environment, even as the broad real estate sector begins stumbling.With a solid portfolio of commercial properties and consistent occupancy rates, Realty Income consistently distributes dividends to its investors. This consistent income stream and potential capital appreciation make it a go-to option for income-focused investors navigating a rising interest-rate scenario.For land-shy investors understandably avoiding real estate due to ballooning mortgages, rest assured that Realty Income’s leasees are as reliable as they come and include consumer staples like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW).On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in MDT.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy.One of the industries that have benefitted directly from the technology boom over the past few years is software infrastructure. Tech and non-tech companies need software infrastructure and solutions to run their business smoothly. Companies spend a fortune on servers, migration to Cloud, network monitoring and management, internal and external communication software, software delivery and bug tracking, error handling and IT operations. All of this comes under the broader umbrella of software infrastructure.T. Rowe Price in a report published in March 2021 highlighted the importance of investing in the software infrastructure space since the firm believes companies powering the “digital economy” will enjoy massive growth in the years to come. The firm noted how the Cloud computing revolution “upended” giants like SAP and Oracle which were focused on on-premise software and forced them to make massive changes in their business. T. Rowe said these giants were challenged by companies like Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.com (T. Rowe said it was an early investor in these firms).T. Rowe explained why it’s bullish on the software infrastructure industry in these words:The suppliers of technologies enabling this transformation are a key focus of our portfolios. We pursue companies that provide the key infrastructure and services for enterprises seeking to digitalize their businesses. In our view, firms providing crucial software, cloud resources, and cybersecurity could be poised to enjoy years of solid growth as technology deepens its impact on revenue, cost savings, and competitiveness.The Cloud Infrastructure IndustryOne of the biggest segments of the software infrastructure market is the Cloud infrastructure industry. More and more companies are embracing Cloud every day for their business needs to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Cloud infrastructure market recently felt the heat due to a slowdown in Cloud spending on the back of rising inflation, analysts believe the industry will soon come out of the slowdown.Story continuesAccording to a report from Synergy Research Group, enterprise spending on Cloud infrastructure in the first quarter of 2023 stood at $63 billion, a massive increase from $10 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. The Cloud infrastructure market is highly saturated, with the top three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) taking up about 65% share.Software Infrastructure Industry Outlook: 2023 and BeyondTalking to Bloomberg earlier this year, Mandeep Singh, a senior technology analyst, said that the infrastructure software domain spans four major areas: databases, system software, DevOps and cybersecurity. Singh said that the latest pullback in tech stocks has created a lot of difference between the valuations and fundamentals of some of the top companies in the infrastructure software space. Singh believes several of these companies have “non-discretionary” capabilities and pricing power. He sees 35%-40% topline growth potential and believes these stocks won’t stay suppressed for too long since he thinks up to 70% decline in the space is not representative of the actual value of these stocks.Singh talked about the possibility of M&amp;A activity and consolidation in the infrastructure software industry in the near future since he believes major companies like Microsoft and Atlassian who are “bundling” a lot of solutions in their offerings are making services like Asana, Monday.com, Smartsheet ""redundant.""Singh is highly bullish on the cybersecurity segment of the infrastructure software market since he believes the presence of sophisticated attacks and the “fear of losing intellectual property” are forcing spending in the sector and we are expected to see robust growth in the industry. He especially talked about CrowdStrike and Zscaler and highlighted their “positive revisions.”Perhaps the biggest player in the Cloud infrastructure domain in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has big plans for the future, especially after the arrival of generative AI capabilities on the scene. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy has been emphasizing the growth opportunities AWS has over the past few months. He talked about Cloud infrastructure and AI-related capabilities in the company’s latest earnings call:One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise’ infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it’s best for customers long term, we’ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We’ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we’re seeing, and I’ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we’re seeing in AWS.The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it’s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we’re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example.For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds updated as of the end of March 2023 and picked 12 software infrastructure stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Some notable names include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW).Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy12. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides software-define infrastructure (SDI) solutions for businesses to help them manage their networking, storage, automation, and overall software development and deployment. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is known for HPE OneView, which is an integrated IT infrastructure software that uses automation to solve key software infrastructure problems.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 37 hedge funds had stakes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) at the end of the first quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) during this period was Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $208.4 million stake in the company.11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) focuses on the security side of software infrastructure since it’s primarily a Cloud security company. It’s known for its Cloud infrastructure modernization solution called The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange. Zscaler also provides Infrastructure as Code services to provide Cloud security.38 out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of hedge funds had stakes in Zscaler, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ZS) was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $122 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”9.

OCI is a differentiated cloud infrastructure provider that is gaining share due to its strong value proposition in speed, performance, and security.

15,e682612d-8035-32d4-88f6-db2a4147ebe7,PH,2023-05-28,14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-industrial-stocks-buy-132521068.html,1685193921,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT', 'CAT', 'FDX', 'BA', 'PH', 'MMM', 'ETN', 'HON', 'GE', 'TDG', 'UNP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 14 best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

Furthermore, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also revealed that the company had managed to reduce its inventory levels by $500 million since August last year.Overall, 51 hedge funds held a stake in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) during Q1 2023.11. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is a Texas, United States-based producer of construction equipment and related machinery.On May 9, David Raso at Evercore ISI gave Caterpillar Inc.

(NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the company reported a better-than-expected Q3 as demand in mining, non-residential construction and energy remained healthy through the year even as recession fears grew. Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Citadel Investment Group was the leading hedge fund investor in the company, with a stake worth over $467 million during the first quarter of the year.Artisan Partners shared its outlook on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years.

The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

The company attributed the improvement to reduced yearly incentive cash compensation and efficient working capital management. Furthermore, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also revealed that the company had managed to reduce its inventory levels by $500 million since August last year.Overall, 51 hedge funds held a stake in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) during Q1 2023.11. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Caterpillar Inc.

Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years.

(NASDAQ:HON), up from 44 in the previous quarter.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a global presence in the aerospace, defence, technology, and information security sectors.On May 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had been granted a firm-fixed-price contract valued at $750.55 million. The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.2%. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, based ont he last payment, Schlumberger was earning enough to cover the dividend pretty comfortably. However, with more than 75% of free cash flow being paid out to shareholders, future growth could potentially be constrained.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 61.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.10 total annually to $1.00. Payments have been decreasing at a very slow pace in this time period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Schlumberger has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Our Thoughts On Schlumberger's DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Schlumberger's payments are rock solid. While Schlumberger is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Schlumberger that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) share price is up 92% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 45% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 5.3% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Mastercard While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Mastercard achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Mastercard's TSR for the last 5 years was 97%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Mastercard has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.3% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 15% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Mastercard .If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

25,e682612d-8035-32d4-88f6-db2a4147ebe7,LMT,2023-05-28,14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-industrial-stocks-buy-132521068.html,1685193921,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT', 'CAT', 'FDX', 'BA', 'PH', 'MMM', 'ETN', 'HON', 'GE', 'TDG', 'UNP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 14 best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

Furthermore, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also revealed that the company had managed to reduce its inventory levels by $500 million since August last year.Overall, 51 hedge funds held a stake in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) during Q1 2023.11.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years. The company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.In Q1 2023, Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) posted an EPS of $1.88, up 16% from the same period last year.

(NASDAQ:HON), up from 44 in the previous quarter.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a global presence in the aerospace, defence, technology, and information security sectors.On May 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had been granted a firm-fixed-price contract valued at $750.55 million. The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

28,59aa5ffc-9695-3516-976a-6f6cf67ffc0d,MDT,2023-05-28,Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.69,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-nyse-mdt-increasing-dividend-122240857.html,1685276560,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 14th of July to $0.69, with investors receiving 1.5% more than last year's $0.68. This makes the dividend yield 3.3%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic Medtronic's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 79% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 62.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 65% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.historic-dividendMedtronic Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.04 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Medtronic May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings have grown at around 4.3% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. The earnings growth is anaemic, and the company is paying out 97% of its profit. This gives limited room for the company to raise the dividend in the future.Medtronic's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Medtronic's payments are rock solid. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

29,3acc11b6-7ff4-3f38-8e7d-35ace6844e2c,MRK,2023-05-28,7 Stocks That Could Be the Next $2 Trillion-Dollar Companies,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-could-next-2-001840060.html,1684887520,STORY,"['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'NOW', 'NVDA', 'LLY', 'BYDDY', 'MRK']","[As someone who has been writing about stocks professionally for 18 years, I remember when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the first companies with $1 trillion market capitalizations. There was a great deal of fascination with the milestones at the time. Subsequently, both overcame the $2 trillion mark,  and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also joined the $1 trillion club. I guess it’s natural that the first companies to cross that huge $1 trillion threshold would get by far the most attention. Still, I find it interesting to contemplate the question of which names will be the next stocks to become future $2 trillion companies.Certainly, the advent of a few new technologies will make it much easier for more firms to become future $2 trillion companies in the future. Of course, there’s the transition to the cloud, which was the key factor that enabled MSFT’s market capitalization to eclipse $1 trillion, then $2 trillion. Now AI has become the next, big technology that will propel multiple firms to become the future $2 trillion companies. Some of those companies could include:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsServiceNow (NOW)cow made out of cash in green field with bright blue sky behind itSource: Reel2Reel/shutterstock.comServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) will join the $2 trillion companies’ list thanks to its time-and-money-saving technology which incorporates “workflow automation” and “artificial intelligence.” As I explained in a past column, NOW allows firms “to automate many routine IT tasks.” In my opinion, NOW will continue to deliver great financial results and grow rapidly because there are few things that firms like better than large, nearly immediate cost savings.Further, as AI advances, NOW’s solutions are also likely to become even more helpful and financially rewarding to its customers. Indeed, it’s encouraging that NOW isn’t resting on its laurels and is increasing its exposure to AI, as it recently bought G2K. The latter firm’s technology uses AI to enhance companies’ ability to analyze data.Story continuesAlso positive is NOW’s decision to, for the first time buy back NOW stock. Specifically, the company disclosed on May 17 that it plans to purchase $1.5 billion of NOW stock. The move will hasten the company’s path to the $2 trillion level and shows that it has more confidence than ever in its ability to become one of the world’s most valuable companies.Amazon (AMZN)A pink piggy bank sits on top of piles of cash to represent cash-rich stocksSource: ShutterstockAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is not that far away from becoming one of the first companies to reach the $2 trillion market. Right now, its market capitalization stands at $1.185 trillion.Of course, Amazon’s cloud business is continuing to grow rapidly, and that will help it reach the $2 trillion club. Also growing rapidly is Amazon’s ad business. Moreover, I remain convinced that, at some point this year, consumers will reduce their spending on experiences and increase the percentage of the funds that they spend on products. That will be positive for Amazon’s massive e-commerce business and for AMZN stock. Also noteworthy is that all of the company’s businesses that I’ve mentioned so far can be meaningfully boosted by AI.Another key to AMZN becoming one of the $2 trillion companies of the future is its ability to disrupt America’s highly inefficient pharmaceutical sector. As I’ve mentioned in the past, by cutting out multiple “middlemen,” Amazon will be able to, through its new Amazon Clinic service, provide drugs much more cheaply to Americans versus what they’re currently paying. I believe that will become a huge business for AMZN within a year or two.Finally, autonomous driving and other technological innovations will allow Amazon’s e-commerce business to accelerate its market-share gains.Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial MoneySource: ShutterstockAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also nearing the $2 trillion mark. In fact, its current market cap stands at $1.56 trillion. I think it’s worth noting that I expect GOOG to reach $2 trillion in the next year or two. Of course, AI will boost the effectiveness of the company’s search engine business. Consequently, the search engine’s revenue growth will accelerate as it takes tremendous market share from non-digital ad platforms.Alphabet can also use AI to enhance the “stickiness” of YouTube, and the service will be able to make its ads much more interactive. Additionally, Alphabet should be able to offer AI services via Google Cloud. Finally, I expect Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous-driving unit, to, within the next few years, start generating significant amounts of revenue for Alphabet.BYD (BYDDF)a man sitting on a chair, typing on a laptop while cash falls from the ceilingSource: ShutterstockChinese automaker BYD (OTC:BYDDF) has become the world’s leading seller of electric vehicles if one counts plug-in hybrids as EVs. Moreover, the automaker generates a significant amount of revenue from selling electric buses and batteries for EVs, large-scale electricity storage, and consumer-electronic products. I expect the demand for all of these ancillary products to grow significantly over the longer term.Also in the longer term, I predict that BYD’s revenue from subscriptions that it sells to the owners of its EVs will soar. That’s because, as time goes on, the ability of automakers to offer subscriptions for services like monitoring data and enhancing vehicles’ security is likely to increase meaningfully.Further, BYD will probably greatly increase its deliveries in other countries in the coming years. That’s because it appears to, more than any other EV maker, have developed the ability to manufacture affordable yet popular and profitable EVs. For example, its Seagull EV costs $11,300 in Europe and should be very appealing to many European consumers.Nvidia (NVDA)Man in blue formal wear tuxedo standing as money 'rains' on him, isolated on red vivid background.Source: ShutterstockPowered by Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) sales of chips for use in developing AI, Nvidia stock is closing in on the $1 trillion market, as its market capitalization as of the market close on May 22 was $771 billion. Within the next few years, I believe that Nvidia’s opportunity in AI will probably enable it to be one of the next stocks to reach the $2 trillion level.Adding to my conviction about the strong, longer-term outlook of NVDA stock, Bank of America is estimating that the total available market for AI accelerators may reach $50 billion to $60 billion in 2027. And the bank believes that NVDA is well-positioned to succeed in that market since Nvidia already has all of the elements that it needs in the sector, while “many competitors” will need a decade or more to catch up with it.Meanwhile, two investment banks — Oppenheimer and Susquehanna — also recently expressed optimism about Nvidia’s opportunity in the AI space. The banks believe that the proliferation of AI is enabling Nvidia to sell many more of its graphics processing units, which are used to create AI.Finally, last month CNBC reported that “Nvidia’s most-advanced graphics cards are selling for more than $40,000 on eBay,” amid strong demand from AI developers.Merck (MRK)Source: ShutterstockMerck’s (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda is one of, if not the most, successful cancer drugs of all time. The treatment generated $20.9 billion in sales for Merck last year. And the pharmaceutical giant is constantly taking steps that enable the drug to be used to combat new types of cancers. For example, just earlier this month, it presented data showing that the drug, in combination with chemotherapy,  raised overall survival rates in first-line lung cancer, The data will likely lead to a new approval for Keytruda in Europe.Keytruda’s patent will expire in 2028, but Merck appears to be taking steps, including working on ” two subcutaneous versions of Keytruda.” that will likely wind up extending the drug’s patent protection,And crucially, Merck has shown the willingness and ability to make positive, game-changing acquisitions. One recent deal in that category was its agreement, made last month, to take over Prometheus Bio (NASDAQ:RXDX). The latter firm has developed ” a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease” that looks poised to become very successful. In a trial late last year, 26.5% of ulcerative colitis patients who took Prometheus’ drug entered remission, versus just 1.5% of those who received placebos.Many Wall Street analysts are upbeat on the drug, and it does seem poised to make a great deal of money for Merck. With Keytruda likely to generate huge revenue and profits for Merck well into the future and the company making superb acquisitions, MRK stock looks poised to reach the $2 trillion mark in 2028 or shortly thereafter.Eli Lilly (LLY)Source: ShutterstockEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has two blockbuster drugs on the way that will very likely enable LLY to become one of the next $2 trillion companies. LLY’s Alzheimer’s treatment, donanemab, “was effective in reducing cognitive and functional decline in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease,” the company reported last month.Meanwhile, the company’s weight-loss drug, Mounjaro, has demonstrated the ability to enable Type 2 diabetes patients to exercise “chronic weight management.” And the FDA may approve the drug as a treatment for all obese and overweight patients “as soon as” this year. Taken together, I believe that these drugs will enable LLY stock to eclipse the $2 trillion mark in 2028 or not very long thereafter.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer’s wife owned shares of NOW.

The jet took off Sunday morning from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and landed less than two hours later in Beijing.The flight was operated by state-owned China Eastern Airlines and the side of the plane was emblazoned with the words: “The World's First C919.”The inaugural flight comes as COMAC looks to break into the single-aisle jet market in a direct challenge to Airbus and Boeing. Airbus’s A320 and Boeing’s B737 jets are the most popular aircrafts typically used for domestic and regional flights.While COMAC designed many of the C919’s parts, some of its key components are still sourced from the West, including its engine.The company plans to build 150 C919 planes each year for the next five years, according to earlier state media reports.The C919, which had been in development for 16 years, has a maximum range of about 3,500 miles (5,630 kilometers) and is designed to carry between 158 and 168 passengers.Over 1,200 C919 jetliners have been ordered, COMAC says, with China Eastern Airlines under contract to buy five of them.]"

To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Caterpillar Inc.

Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years.

(NASDAQ:HON), up from 44 in the previous quarter.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a global presence in the aerospace, defence, technology, and information security sectors.On May 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had been granted a firm-fixed-price contract valued at $750.55 million. The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Literally too many jobs and not enough people for at least the next 30 years.”Jobs lost to A.I.Schmidt argued that while job losses in the near term might be inevitable, A.I. will have an overall positive impact because of enhanced efficiency and the technology's ability to replace professions already getting harder to fill in shrinking labor markets.Goldman Sachs estimated in March that while A.I. might lead to new jobs and a productivity boom, it could also expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation.If A.I. ultimately does help society in the long term while creating hardship for many in the nearer term, it wouldn’t be a first for technological innovation.MIT economics professor Daron Acemoglu told the Financial Times this week that while the Industrial Revolution did lead to progress, “you also had costs that were huge and very long-lasting. A hundred years of much harsher conditions for working people, lower real wages, much worse health and living conditions, less autonomy, greater hierarchy.”With A.I. threatening many white-collar jobs today, he believes the U.S. needs a strong labor relations movement. “We need to create an environment in which workers have a voice,” he said, suggesting something more like Germany’s system—where the public and private sectors and labor work together—than America’s more contentious company-by-company approach.Story continuesA few months ago, Acemoglu joined Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak in signing an open letter calling for a pause on A.I. tools more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4. The letter read in part:""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.”Meanwhile OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, on a tour meeting with European leaders, said Friday: ""This idea that A.I. is going to progress to a point where humans don't have any work to do or don't have any purpose has never resonated with me.”""Power will shift""Then again, in March 2021—before most people were aware of ChatGPT or OpenAI, now valued at nearly $30 billion—Altman wrote in a lengthy blog post:“My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.”In 2019, Altman cofounded Worldcoin, a crypto startup involving eyeball scans for identification. If A.I. takes too many jobs and governments decide that a universal basic income is needed, Worldcoin wants to be the distribution mechanism for those payments. For now it's aiming to be the way people prove they are actual humans and not A.I. bots online. The company announced a $115 million Series C funding round this week.Krishna recently said that IBM would slow or suspend hiring in non-customer-facing roles that currently amount to about 26,000 workers. He added, “I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by A.I. and automation over a five-year period.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy.One of the industries that have benefitted directly from the technology boom over the past few years is software infrastructure. Tech and non-tech companies need software infrastructure and solutions to run their business smoothly. Companies spend a fortune on servers, migration to Cloud, network monitoring and management, internal and external communication software, software delivery and bug tracking, error handling and IT operations. All of this comes under the broader umbrella of software infrastructure.T. Rowe Price in a report published in March 2021 highlighted the importance of investing in the software infrastructure space since the firm believes companies powering the “digital economy” will enjoy massive growth in the years to come. The firm noted how the Cloud computing revolution “upended” giants like SAP and Oracle which were focused on on-premise software and forced them to make massive changes in their business. T. Rowe said these giants were challenged by companies like Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.com (T. Rowe said it was an early investor in these firms).T. Rowe explained why it’s bullish on the software infrastructure industry in these words:The suppliers of technologies enabling this transformation are a key focus of our portfolios. We pursue companies that provide the key infrastructure and services for enterprises seeking to digitalize their businesses. In our view, firms providing crucial software, cloud resources, and cybersecurity could be poised to enjoy years of solid growth as technology deepens its impact on revenue, cost savings, and competitiveness.The Cloud Infrastructure IndustryOne of the biggest segments of the software infrastructure market is the Cloud infrastructure industry. More and more companies are embracing Cloud every day for their business needs to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Cloud infrastructure market recently felt the heat due to a slowdown in Cloud spending on the back of rising inflation, analysts believe the industry will soon come out of the slowdown.Story continuesAccording to a report from Synergy Research Group, enterprise spending on Cloud infrastructure in the first quarter of 2023 stood at $63 billion, a massive increase from $10 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. The Cloud infrastructure market is highly saturated, with the top three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) taking up about 65% share.Software Infrastructure Industry Outlook: 2023 and BeyondTalking to Bloomberg earlier this year, Mandeep Singh, a senior technology analyst, said that the infrastructure software domain spans four major areas: databases, system software, DevOps and cybersecurity. Singh said that the latest pullback in tech stocks has created a lot of difference between the valuations and fundamentals of some of the top companies in the infrastructure software space. Singh believes several of these companies have “non-discretionary” capabilities and pricing power. He sees 35%-40% topline growth potential and believes these stocks won’t stay suppressed for too long since he thinks up to 70% decline in the space is not representative of the actual value of these stocks.Singh talked about the possibility of M&amp;A activity and consolidation in the infrastructure software industry in the near future since he believes major companies like Microsoft and Atlassian who are “bundling” a lot of solutions in their offerings are making services like Asana, Monday.com, Smartsheet ""redundant.""Singh is highly bullish on the cybersecurity segment of the infrastructure software market since he believes the presence of sophisticated attacks and the “fear of losing intellectual property” are forcing spending in the sector and we are expected to see robust growth in the industry. He especially talked about CrowdStrike and Zscaler and highlighted their “positive revisions.”Perhaps the biggest player in the Cloud infrastructure domain in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has big plans for the future, especially after the arrival of generative AI capabilities on the scene. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy has been emphasizing the growth opportunities AWS has over the past few months. He talked about Cloud infrastructure and AI-related capabilities in the company’s latest earnings call:One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise’ infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it’s best for customers long term, we’ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We’ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we’re seeing, and I’ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we’re seeing in AWS.The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it’s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we’re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example.For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds updated as of the end of March 2023 and picked 12 software infrastructure stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Some notable names include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW).Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy12. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides software-define infrastructure (SDI) solutions for businesses to help them manage their networking, storage, automation, and overall software development and deployment. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is known for HPE OneView, which is an integrated IT infrastructure software that uses automation to solve key software infrastructure problems.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 37 hedge funds had stakes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) at the end of the first quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) during this period was Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $208.4 million stake in the company.11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) focuses on the security side of software infrastructure since it’s primarily a Cloud security company. It’s known for its Cloud infrastructure modernization solution called The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange. Zscaler also provides Infrastructure as Code services to provide Cloud security.38 out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of hedge funds had stakes in Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The most notable hedge fund stakeholder which had stakes in Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $122 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is known for its infrastructure monitoring solutions that help businesses see their systems’ backend in real time, detect and resolve solutions. Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”9.

However, experts project that by 2030, the sector could command a valuation of $125 billion. For speculators, it’s well worth considering millionaire quantum computing stock picks. To be sure, because of the novel market, investors should be prepared for wild unpredictability. Nevertheless, investing in quantum computing stocks could lead to life-changing returns.IBMIBM.$128.18RGTIRigetti Computing$0.74QUBTQuantum Computing$1.16InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVInitially, the inclusion of IBM (NYSE:IBM) as one of the quantum computing stocks for millionaires might not make sense. After all, this segment is supposed to be about high-risk, high-reward speculation. However, if you’re interested in taking the more surefire, steady approach to being a millionaire, “Big Blue” makes plenty of sense.Fundamentally, IBM belongs in the discussion for top quantum computing stocks thanks to its myriad innovations in the sector. For example, the company produced Qiskit Runtime, which is IBM’s quantum computing service and programming model.Financially, IBM carries a decent profile: nothing too positively remarkable but nothing too horrible either. Notably, IBM trades at a forward multiple of 13.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Big Blue ranks better than 79.51% of the competition. Also, its dividend yield comes out to 5.46%, which is quite generous.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg IBM as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $147.38, implying nearly 16% upside potential.Rigetti Computing (RGTI)IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020. Quantum computing stocks.Source: Boykov / Shutterstock.comBased in Berkeley, California, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) develops quantum integrated circuits used for quantum computers. Per its website, Rigetti specializes in fusing artificial intelligence and machine learning, thereby allowing the company to address the world’s most important and pressing problems. A wildly risky investment, RGTI only gained a bit more than half a percent in the year so far.Most of that stems from shares popping up nearly 45% on the May 22 session, rising in sympathy with quantum computing rival D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS). If you follow the sector closely, you’ll know that QBTS skyrocketed almost 111% on Monday. However, plenty of traders don’t want to overexpose themselves to extreme strength, making RGTI a potentially intriguing alternative for quantum computing stocks for millionaires.To be sure, it’s financially a high-risk proposition. According to Zacks Equity Research, Rigetti came out with a quarterly loss of 19 cents for its first-quarter earnings report, missing the consensus estimate of a loss of 16 cents. On the positive side, Rigetti carries a relatively strong cash-to-debt ratio of 3.27. Still, despite some flaws, analysts peg RGTI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $1.25, implying over 70% upside potential.Quantum Computing (QUBT)Source: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to take their quantum computing stocks for millionaires to the extreme, Quantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) may be what you’re looking for. A full-stack quantum software and hardware company, Quantum seeks to accelerate the value of quantum computing for real-world business solutions, per its website. To help bring about this goal, the company bought out QPhoton, which specializes in quantum photonic systems (QPS).Although fundamentally exciting, prospective investors must recognize that QUBT represents a high-risk, high-reward venture. In the trailing one-year period, for example, QUBT stumbled by more than 17%. Over the past five years, shares hemorrhaged 79% of equity value.Financially, circumstances aren’t exactly confidence-building. In the first quarter of 2023, Quantum posted revenue of only $120,000. On the bottom line, it incurred a net loss of $8.51 million. Overall, the company features only middling fiscal stability, making it one of the riskier quantum computing stocks to buy. That said, Ascendiant analyst Edward Woo pegs QUBT as a buy. The expert forecasts a price target of $9.25, implying almost 612% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

42,0e9fcbb1-20dd-333a-aff4-c257118bc1a0,ADI,2023-05-28,"Should You Investigate Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) At US$177?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-110017530.html,1685271617,STORY,['ADI'],"[Let's talk about the popular Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$197 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$172. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Analog Devices' current trading price of US$177 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices What Is Analog Devices Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.56% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $162.62, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Analog Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Analog Devices look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 20% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Analog Devices. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Analog Devices, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Analog Devices, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

43,937ce9d6-44bf-324a-ab9f-8a310a7916cb,VZ,2023-05-28,Can Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE:VZ) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-110055589.html,1685271655,STORY,['VZ'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:23% = US$22b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verizon Communications has a higher ROE than the average (10%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesVerizon Communications' Debt And Its 23% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.71. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

But for many workers, the rapid onset of AI technology is raising anxiety about the future of their careers. And no generation is more worried than millennials.According to a new survey from HR platform Checkr, millennials are especially worried about how AI will impact their job and pay prospects, with 82% of millennial workers concerned AI will result in lower pay for the same position. This compares to 78% of all respondents worried about this risk.""The data shows that Millennials are stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" said Checkr head of digital content Sara Korolevich. ""While Gen Z is considered digitally native, and Boomers and Gen X are beginning to leave the workforce, even the oldest Millennials still have at least another 20 years of employment in front of them, leaving them vulnerable to the potentially widespread changes this technology could bring about.""Checkr's survey — which is part of a report called ""Insights from American Workers"" and included results from 3,000 US employees across four generations — was conducted between April 27-28 of this year.The origins of job anxiety in the AI revolution have already become inescapably clear — as AI is already threatening jobs in media, marketing, and restaurants.Checkr's data also showed that millennials might be willing to to take a financial hit of their own to get up to speed on AI. To avoid being replaced, 77% of millennials surveyed said they're willing spend their own money building up their AI know-how. In the data Checkr gathered, millennials' anxiety was singular.""Throughout history, technological disruption and change on this scale have been met with anxiety and uncertainty,"" said Korolevich. ""The emergence of generative AI and language models are no different, so it’s no surprise that American workers are fearful of how this technology will change how they work and even how much they’re paid. However, it’s shocking to see just how many people feel this way.""Story continues'I expect there to be a significant impact on jobs'As AI has boomed, the technology's risks have also moved to the front-and-center of the public's consciousness. One of those key concerns revolves around jobs: will AI be a job-taker or a job-creator?For Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, the answer, in certain ways at least, seems to be both simple and unknowable, according to his testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman arrives for a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence on May 16 in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""Like with all technological revolutions, I expect there to be significant impact on jobs, but exactly what that impact looks like is very difficult to predict,"" Altman told the committee. ""If we went back to the other side of a previous technological revolution, talking about the jobs that exist on the other side you know, you can go back and read books of this. It’s what people said at the time. It’s difficult.""""I believe that there will be far greater jobs on the other side of this, and that the jobs of today will get better.""Yes, jobs will be affected. Yes, there may be fewer jobs of a certain type. But there will also be new jobs. And with those new areas of work, perhaps growth as well.""I believe that there will be far greater jobs on the other side of this,"" Altman added, ""and that the jobs of today will get better.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Therefore, if you purchase Genuine Parts' shares on or after the 1st of June, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 3rd of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.95 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Genuine Parts stock has a trailing yield of around 2.4% on the current share price of $157.21. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Genuine Parts's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Genuine Parts Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Genuine Parts paid out a comfortable 41% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Genuine Parts generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 55% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Genuine Parts's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Genuine Parts's earnings per share have been growing at 16% a year for the past five years. Genuine Parts is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Genuine Parts has delivered 6.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Genuine Parts worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Genuine Parts paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Genuine Parts is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Genuine Parts you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

55,1a27bbe1-60ad-325c-9dd2-014917375631,CMI,2023-05-28,Investing in Cummins (NYSE:CMI) five years ago would have delivered you a 70% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-cummins-nyse-cmi-five-110103332.html,1685271663,STORY,['CMI'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 13% in that time. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 48%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 61%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Cummins While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Cummins managed to grow its earnings per share at 26% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 11.93 also suggests market apprehension.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Cummins' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Cummins, it has a TSR of 70% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Cummins has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.0% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 11% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Cummins  that you should be aware of.We will like Cummins better if we see some big insider buys.

58,49fc0fce-ddb3-3641-96a9-f4aa65ab213b,FFIV,2023-05-28,Capital Allocation Trends At F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) Aren't Ideal,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-allocation-trends-f5-nasdaq-141019597.html,1685196619,STORY,['FFIV'],"[What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for F5:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$427m ÷ (US$5.2b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, F5 has an ROCE of 12%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.5% generated by the Communications industry. View our latest analysis for F5 roceIn the above chart we have measured F5's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for F5.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at F5, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 38% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Bottom LineIn summary, F5 is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 15% in the last five years. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with F5 and understanding it should be part of your investment process.While F5 may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

59,454bd81d-17ce-30c1-adab-c8cbbf2c9431,CL,2023-05-28,7 Safe-Haven Stocks to Buy for Protection From a U.S. Debt Default Disaster,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safe-haven-stocks-buy-231850504.html,1684883930,STORY,"['TGT', 'JNJ', 'COST', 'XOM', 'LOW', 'PG', 'PGR', 'CL']","[With the debt ceiling issue rating as perhaps the single-most critical issue for the market right now, investors should consider targeting safe-haven stocks for debt default. Naturally, the U.S. government defaulting on its obligations would probably spark a ripple effect. However, it’s also important to consider safe havens because raising the debt ceiling presents its own set of problems.At the time of writing, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are resuming discussions about the issue. Available news points to an earlier productive phone call. Nevertheless, CNN states that if policymakers fail to raise the ceiling, it could trigger an economic downturn. Therefore, it’s vital to consider stocks to buy for U.S. debt default.At the same time, raising the ceiling won’t be consequence-free. For one thing, the action encourages fiscal irresponsibility. It could also lower the U.S. credit rating and increase debt costs. Plus, with the recent bank failures, we’ve seen the impact of governmental policies going awry. Therefore, investors should start thinking about protection from debt default stocks. In other words, either action may induce volatility. On that note, these are the safe stocks during debt default (or a raised ceiling).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$77.04PGProcter &amp; Gamble$147.55COSTCostco$484.87PGRProgressive$133.35LOWLowe’s$206.65JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$156.81XOMExxon Mobil$106.40Colgate-Palmolive (CL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAbout as boring of an idea as you can get, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) nevertheless meets the criteria for safe-haven stocks for debt default. Let’s look at it this way. Even if policymakers let negotiations break down and let the country fall into default, people will still need to brush their teeth. And they’ll need to take care of a host of other needs. Therefore, CL seems an ideal anchor.Story continuesTo be fair, Colgate’s financials are somewhat middling in certain areas. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 5.5% is just under the consumer packaged goods sector’s median metric of 5.7%. However, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise. Right now, it sports a trailing-year net margin of 8.71%, above 77% of industry rivals.Also, Colgate features a dividend yield of 2.31%. According to TipRanks, this figure slightly beats out the underlying sector’s average yield of 2.125%. Also, its payout ratio of 63.72% isn’t remarkably great but credible in terms of yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $81.34, implying less than 2% upside potential.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest names in the household goods segment, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) offers another ideal opportunity among safe-haven stocks for debt default. No matter what happens with the debt ceiling, people will need to use the restroom. Here and for many other reasons, Procter &amp; Gamble provides relevant products. In the year so far, PG gained a bit over 1%.Financially, the company’s stronghold centers on its profitability, where it consistently prints net income. Further, its trailing-year net margin pings at 17.69%, ranked better than 91.92% of the competition. Also, its three-year EBITDA growth rate comes in at 31.2%, outflanking 80.76% of sector rivals.To be sure, investors of stocks to buy for U.S. debt default probably won’t get rich off of the company’s passive income. However, it does offer a 2.41% yield which beats out the consumer goods sector average. Also, the payout ratio is a sustainable 64.09%. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $165.44, implying 8% upside potential.Costco (COST)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comWith so many questions about what may happen over the next several days, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers an intriguing idea for safe-haven stocks for debt default. Fundamentally, raising the ceiling might be long-term inflationary. True, the Federal Reserve might respond with hawkish monetary policies but the public eventually pays for governmental intervention. If that’s the case, Costco belongs on your radar.With the open-warehouse-style retailer incentivizing bulk purchasing, Costco offers a practical solution for mitigating higher prices. Financially, the company presents an encouraging profile. On the operational side, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 82.75% of rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 15.4%.Also, Costco features a rock-solid balance sheet. It carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.5, above the defensive retail sector’s 0.41-times median stat. Also, its Altman Z-Score hits 7.31, indicating high stability and low bankruptcy risk. In closing, analysts peg COST as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $540.55, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn insurance company, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) is the second largest insurance carrier, and the largest commercial auto insurer in the U.S., according to its public profile. Fundamentally, PGR ranks among the safe-haven stocks for debt default because the underlying company owns a captive audience. With very few exceptions, drivers in the U.S. must carry auto insurance.To be sure, Progressive does have competition in the arena, let’s bring that to the table. However, for those seeking protection from debt default stocks, Progressive may have an advantage because of its brand power. Consumers love its quirky commercials, contributing to its strong presence in the industry.In fairness, Progressive’s financials aren’t objectively remarkable. However, the company does sport a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.3%, which ranks better than 67.11% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PGR as a moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $147.07, implying nearly 9% upside potential. Therefore, it’s arguably one of the safe stocks during debt default.Lowe’s (LOW)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA giant in the home improvement space, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) should be an intriguing, slow-and-steady grinder among safe-haven stocks for debt default. Since the end of 2021, shares of Lowe’s faded amid declining demand urgency in the real estate market (relatively speaking). However, it makes sense as a reliable investment because the company provides basic tools and materials for everyday maintenance needs.Financially, Lowe’s isn’t the perfect idea for investing in safe-haven stocks. For full disclosure, some elements of its balance sheet could use some shoring up, particularly the lowly cash-to-debt ratio. Nevertheless, the company does bring the heat on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.4%, above 81.2% of other cyclical retailers.And while it’s not the most impressive source of passive income, Lowe’s dividend yield is 2.06%. On the encouraging side, its payout ratio is 30.56%, ranking high for sustainability. Looking at the Street, analysts peg LOW as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $321.67, implying over 12% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockNo matter what materializes with the debt ceiling, the healthcare sector will likely remain a viable one. Therefore, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) brings an enticing case for safe-haven stocks for debt default. For clarification, JNJ is more volatile than what you might consider a “safe” enterprise. Since the beginning of this year, JNJ slipped nearly 11%. Still, this dynamic might attract speculators.Financially, Johnson &amp; Johnson brings a decent profile to the table: nothing too grand but nothing too worrying either. In particular, the company draws the most strength from its consistent profitability. Its trailing-year net margin prints a healthy 13.22%, ranked better than 78% of the field.On the passive income side, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.81%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.5%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 44.44%, an attractively sustainable figure. Thus, it makes a powerful case for stocks to buy for U.S. debt default. Lastly, analysts peg JNJ as a moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $179.52, implying 13% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough the hydrocarbon industry may seem irrelevant considering the broader push for the electrification of transportation, combustion-powered cars may be surprisingly resilient. After all, electric vehicles tend to be expensive and the infrastructure still needs to be built out. Therefore, I like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as one of the safe-haven stocks for debt default. Basically, it enjoys a still-captive audience.Financially, Exxon Mobil delivers the goods. On the operational side, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9%, ranked better than 63.22% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate comes in at 37%, above 75.33% of sector players.Also, Exxon provides robust passive income. Its dividend yield comes in at 3.37%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 24.35%, meaning that investors should have little reason to doubt its sustainability. Thus, it makes sense if you’re seeking protection from debt default stocks. On a final note, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $129.54, implying 22% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy.One of the industries that have benefitted directly from the technology boom over the past few years is software infrastructure. Tech and non-tech companies need software infrastructure and solutions to run their business smoothly. Companies spend a fortune on servers, migration to Cloud, network monitoring and management, internal and external communication software, software delivery and bug tracking, error handling and IT operations. All of this comes under the broader umbrella of software infrastructure.T. Rowe Price in a report published in March 2021 highlighted the importance of investing in the software infrastructure space since the firm believes companies powering the “digital economy” will enjoy massive growth in the years to come. The firm noted how the Cloud computing revolution “upended” giants like SAP and Oracle which were focused on on-premise software and forced them to make massive changes in their business. T. Rowe said these giants were challenged by companies like Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.com (T. Rowe said it was an early investor in these firms).T. Rowe explained why it’s bullish on the software infrastructure industry in these words:The suppliers of technologies enabling this transformation are a key focus of our portfolios. We pursue companies that provide the key infrastructure and services for enterprises seeking to digitalize their businesses. In our view, firms providing crucial software, cloud resources, and cybersecurity could be poised to enjoy years of solid growth as technology deepens its impact on revenue, cost savings, and competitiveness.The Cloud Infrastructure IndustryOne of the biggest segments of the software infrastructure market is the Cloud infrastructure industry. More and more companies are embracing Cloud every day for their business needs to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Cloud infrastructure market recently felt the heat due to a slowdown in Cloud spending on the back of rising inflation, analysts believe the industry will soon come out of the slowdown.Story continuesAccording to a report from Synergy Research Group, enterprise spending on Cloud infrastructure in the first quarter of 2023 stood at $63 billion, a massive increase from $10 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. The Cloud infrastructure market is highly saturated, with the top three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) taking up about 65% share.Software Infrastructure Industry Outlook: 2023 and BeyondTalking to Bloomberg earlier this year, Mandeep Singh, a senior technology analyst, said that the infrastructure software domain spans four major areas: databases, system software, DevOps and cybersecurity. Singh said that the latest pullback in tech stocks has created a lot of difference between the valuations and fundamentals of some of the top companies in the infrastructure software space. Singh believes several of these companies have “non-discretionary” capabilities and pricing power. He sees 35%-40% topline growth potential and believes these stocks won’t stay suppressed for too long since he thinks up to 70% decline in the space is not representative of the actual value of these stocks.Singh talked about the possibility of M&amp;A activity and consolidation in the infrastructure software industry in the near future since he believes major companies like Microsoft and Atlassian who are “bundling” a lot of solutions in their offerings are making services like Asana, Monday.com, Smartsheet ""redundant.""Singh is highly bullish on the cybersecurity segment of the infrastructure software market since he believes the presence of sophisticated attacks and the “fear of losing intellectual property” are forcing spending in the sector and we are expected to see robust growth in the industry. He especially talked about CrowdStrike and Zscaler and highlighted their “positive revisions.”Perhaps the biggest player in the Cloud infrastructure domain in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has big plans for the future, especially after the arrival of generative AI capabilities on the scene. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy has been emphasizing the growth opportunities AWS has over the past few months. He talked about Cloud infrastructure and AI-related capabilities in the company’s latest earnings call:One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise’ infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it’s best for customers long term, we’ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We’ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we’re seeing, and I’ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we’re seeing in AWS.The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it’s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we’re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example.For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds updated as of the end of March 2023 and picked 12 software infrastructure stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:ZS) was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $122 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc.

A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”9.

Their continued operations in China are dependent on licenses granted by Washington, giving the US some leverage over Seoul’s decisions on how it balances its economic engagement with both countries.South Korea is also wary of taking advantage of the Micron situation as it sees the US as a key long-term partner for its semiconductor industry and doesn’t want to disrupt that relationship, said the person.China’s Micron decision has drawn South Korea into the US-China battle over technology access and national security. While Washington is Seoul’s top security partner, China is South Korea’s biggest trade partner.Export ControlsWashington, along with allies in Japan and the Netherlands, has imposed a series of export controls on chipmaking equipment and knowhow to Beijing as the world’s top two economic powers increasingly square off in trade and technology.“A broader ban of Micron semiconductors puts South Korea in the worst of both worlds,” said Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korea Economic Institute. If South Korean companies don’t help with filling the gap left by Micron, China may penalize them the way it did for Seoul’s previous decision to deploy on its soil a US anti-missile defense system, known as Thaad, he said.Story continuesThe Financial Times reported earlier this month that South Korea signaled it would allow its companies to fill the gap left by China’s Micron ban. The government in Seoul denied that, saying it had yet to announce any formal position.It remains unclear whether China would expand its crackdown on US chipmakers or how the US will respond to Beijing’s ruling on Micron. The two sides have recently tried to lower tensions and restore high-level talks, including meetings this week between top commerce officials in Washington.Micron gets about 11% of its revenue from companies headquartered in mainland China. The company estimates total sales to China — combining direct sales plus indirect through distributors — comes to about 25% of revenue. It said May 22 it was still evaluating the impact of the critical information infrastructure ban.In a briefing on Saturday, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the US was speaking to allies about China’s action on Micron. “We see it as plain and simple economic coercion,” she said. “And we won’t tolerate it, nor do we think it will be successful.”Read more: US ‘Won’t Tolerate’ China’s Micron Chips Ban, Raimondo SaysThe Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement after talks with South Korea amid the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Detroit this week that the sides had agreed to strengthen cooperation on semiconductor supply chains.A separate statement from the South Korean trade ministry made no reference to chips and instead said they discussed cooperation on stabilizing critical commodities and components.(Updates with Micron revenue breakdown in 10th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Summer Camp Became Such a Hot Mess for ParentsHarvard MBA Grads Enter a Tepid Job Market Hoping for the BestGoldman CEO Loves Summer Camp So Much He’s Expanded His PortfolioCan Workplace Ketamine Retreats Improve Vibes in the Office?Assault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare Startup©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Having said that, we welcome participation from companies that are in IPEF countries, you know, so we expect that companies from Japan, Korea, Singapore, etc, will participate in the CHIPS Act funding,"" Raimondo said.(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

They’re accustomed to an on-the-go lifestyle in which convenient snacks are the norm rather than three sit-down meals daily. Even then, millennials and Gen Zers want their snacks to taste good, be nutritious, and feel like a whole experience—and better if the snacks are worth posting about on social media or to start a viral trend.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

Those products, he said, were designed to offer consumers something familiar, but with a twist, to elevate the snacking experience for Gen Z and millennials.“We think about them not just as a product, but a whole consumer experience,” Graham said. “I think what’s as important for these generations isn't just the flavor of the product.”According to Mondelez, there is an “increasing interest in more experiential snacks, [and] novel or exotic flavors,” and 80% of the Gen Z and millennials are open to trying new flavors.“Gen Z and millennials have grown up in a world of choice,” Graham said. “What we’ve seen is their needs from snacking are much more diverse.”The eating patterns for Gen Z and millennials have been shifting for years, according to Mondelez, due to busier lifestyles, affordability, and more choices. There is also a generational difference in how snacking is perceived. Graham noted that older generations viewed snacking as a treat or indulgence, but Gen Z and millennials grew up at a time when mealtime was becoming “fragmented,” making snack-eating more mainstream.Story continuesYounger generations are fueling the snacking trend. Seventy-four percent of U.S. consumers under 35 snack at least a few times daily, according to data insights company 84.51°, compared to just 50% for those over 35.And social media plays an important role in feeding the need for new and innovative items. TikTok, in particular, is where the younger generation seeks suggestions and discovers food trends.When it comes to snacking, TikTok is the top platform for Gen Zers seeking ideas for what items to purchase, according to a survey by the social media company earlier this year. TikTok’s data also showed that 77% of the users tried new things after the platform’s fellow snackaholics inspired them to. For example, clips about making ice cream out of cottage cheese and slabs of yogurt “barks” have had tens of millions of views, TikTok found.Graham noted that social media marketing of snack brands like Mondelez factor into whether products become popular among younger generations. Services like TikTok, he said, have given birth to food trends like combining sweet elements with savory dishes, or vice versa.“All of these flavors are coming from this desire for novel experiences,” Graham said. “I think even more so just because of the amount of stimulus that these two generations are getting.”Taste and flavor remain the main criteria for choosing any snack to buy, with 67% of the shoppers surveyed by 84.51° aged between 18 and 34 saying it’s their top priority. Across all age groups, 72% of shoppers prioritized taste over convenience or ability to fulfill their cravings.“The younger shopper is a little bit more demanding because they know they can be and that’s how they’ve grown up, and I think the industry responds pretty well to that,” Alexandra Trott, 84.51°’s director of insights, told Fortune. “So the younger generation just wants it all.”Junk food, which includes potato chips or sugary drinks, has been linked to health risks like obesity and diabetes, but Gen Z and millennials tend to find balance between healthy and not-so-healthy treats they consume. For instance, younger shoppers often check product ingredients when they shop and therefore, opt for yogurt-based snacks for breakfast, for instance.“They’re looking for something that has a little bit more nutritional value,” Trott told Fortune. She gave the example of granola bars and protein bars being used as meal replacements, often in the mornings. Even with nutrition in mind, Trott pointed out that consumers, primarily Gen Z and millennials, would not sacrifice on taste.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 36% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 13% in the last year.While the stock has fallen 3.3% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Norfolk Southern's earnings per share are down 7.1% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.The revenue growth of 1.8% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthNorfolk Southern is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Norfolk Southern the TSR over the last 5 years was 49%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 1.0% in the last year, Norfolk Southern shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Norfolk Southern better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:37% = US$9.9b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Coca-Cola has a better ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCoca-Cola's Debt And Its 37% ROECoca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.63. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

75,851584f5-7a87-352e-8d2f-63191fec807f,WM,2023-05-28,"Read This Before Considering Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) For Its Upcoming US$0.70 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/read-considering-waste-management-inc-122910583.html,1685190550,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Waste Management's shares before the 1st of June to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Waste Management stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of $161.28. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Waste Management's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Waste Management paying out a modest 48% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 73% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Waste Management, with earnings per share up 4.6% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Waste Management has increased its dividend at approximately 7.0% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Waste Management an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Waste Management is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.In light of that, while Waste Management has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Waste Management you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

77,e682612d-8035-32d4-88f6-db2a4147ebe7,GE,2023-05-28,14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-industrial-stocks-buy-132521068.html,1685193921,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT', 'CAT', 'FDX', 'BA', 'PH', 'MMM', 'ETN', 'HON', 'GE', 'TDG', 'UNP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 14 best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years.

(NASDAQ:HON), up from 44 in the previous quarter.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a global presence in the aerospace, defence, technology, and information security sectors.On May 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had been granted a firm-fixed-price contract valued at $750.55 million. The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
78,454bd81d-17ce-30c1-adab-c8cbbf2c9431,PGR,2023-05-28,7 Safe-Haven Stocks to Buy for Protection From a U.S. Debt Default Disaster,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safe-haven-stocks-buy-231850504.html,1684883930,STORY,"['TGT', 'JNJ', 'COST', 'XOM', 'LOW', 'PG', 'PGR', 'CL']","[With the debt ceiling issue rating as perhaps the single-most critical issue for the market right now, investors should consider targeting safe-haven stocks for debt default. Naturally, the U.S. government defaulting on its obligations would probably spark a ripple effect. However, it’s also important to consider safe havens because raising the debt ceiling presents its own set of problems.At the time of writing, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are resuming discussions about the issue. Available news points to an earlier productive phone call. Nevertheless, CNN states that if policymakers fail to raise the ceiling, it could trigger an economic downturn. Therefore, it’s vital to consider stocks to buy for U.S. debt default.At the same time, raising the ceiling won’t be consequence-free. For one thing, the action encourages fiscal irresponsibility. It could also lower the U.S. credit rating and increase debt costs. Plus, with the recent bank failures, we’ve seen the impact of governmental policies going awry. Therefore, investors should start thinking about protection from debt default stocks. In other words, either action may induce volatility. On that note, these are the safe stocks during debt default (or a raised ceiling).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$77.04PGProcter &amp; Gamble$147.55COSTCostco$484.87PGRProgressive$133.35LOWLowe’s$206.65JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$156.81XOMExxon Mobil$106.40Colgate-Palmolive (CL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAbout as boring of an idea as you can get, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) nevertheless meets the criteria for safe-haven stocks for debt default. Let’s look at it this way. Even if policymakers let negotiations break down and let the country fall into default, people will still need to brush their teeth. And they’ll need to take care of a host of other needs. Therefore, CL seems an ideal anchor.Story continuesTo be fair, Colgate’s financials are somewhat middling in certain areas. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 5.5% is just under the consumer packaged goods sector’s median metric of 5.7%. However, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise. Right now, it sports a trailing-year net margin of 8.71%, above 77% of industry rivals.Also, Colgate features a dividend yield of 2.31%. According to TipRanks, this figure slightly beats out the underlying sector’s average yield of 2.125%. Also, its payout ratio of 63.72% isn’t remarkably great but credible in terms of yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $81.34, implying less than 2% upside potential.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest names in the household goods segment, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) offers another ideal opportunity among safe-haven stocks for debt default. No matter what happens with the debt ceiling, people will need to use the restroom. Here and for many other reasons, Procter &amp; Gamble provides relevant products. In the year so far, PG gained a bit over 1%.Financially, the company’s stronghold centers on its profitability, where it consistently prints net income. Further, its trailing-year net margin pings at 17.69%, ranked better than 91.92% of the competition. Also, its three-year EBITDA growth rate comes in at 31.2%, outflanking 80.76% of sector rivals.To be sure, investors of stocks to buy for U.S. debt default probably won’t get rich off of the company’s passive income. However, it does offer a 2.41% yield which beats out the consumer goods sector average. Also, the payout ratio is a sustainable 64.09%. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $165.44, implying 8% upside potential.Costco (COST)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comWith so many questions about what may happen over the next several days, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers an intriguing idea for safe-haven stocks for debt default. Fundamentally, raising the ceiling might be long-term inflationary. True, the Federal Reserve might respond with hawkish monetary policies but the public eventually pays for governmental intervention. If that’s the case, Costco belongs on your radar.With the open-warehouse-style retailer incentivizing bulk purchasing, Costco offers a practical solution for mitigating higher prices. Financially, the company presents an encouraging profile. On the operational side, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 82.75% of rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 15.4%.Also, Costco features a rock-solid balance sheet. It carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.5, above the defensive retail sector’s 0.41-times median stat. Also, its Altman Z-Score hits 7.31, indicating high stability and low bankruptcy risk. In closing, analysts peg COST as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $540.55, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn insurance company, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) is the second largest insurance carrier, and the largest commercial auto insurer in the U.S., according to its public profile. Fundamentally, PGR ranks among the safe-haven stocks for debt default because the underlying company owns a captive audience. With very few exceptions, drivers in the U.S. must carry auto insurance.To be sure, Progressive does have competition in the arena, let’s bring that to the table. However, for those seeking protection from debt default stocks, Progressive may have an advantage because of its brand power. Consumers love its quirky commercials, contributing to its strong presence in the industry.In fairness, Progressive’s financials aren’t objectively remarkable. However, the company does sport a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.3%, which ranks better than 67.11% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PGR as a moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $147.07, implying nearly 9% upside potential. Therefore, it’s arguably one of the safe stocks during debt default.Lowe’s (LOW)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA giant in the home improvement space, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) should be an intriguing, slow-and-steady grinder among safe-haven stocks for debt default. Since the end of 2021, shares of Lowe’s faded amid declining demand urgency in the real estate market (relatively speaking). However, it makes sense as a reliable investment because the company provides basic tools and materials for everyday maintenance needs.Financially, Lowe’s isn’t the perfect idea for investing in safe-haven stocks. For full disclosure, some elements of its balance sheet could use some shoring up, particularly the lowly cash-to-debt ratio. Nevertheless, the company does bring the heat on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.4%, above 81.2% of other cyclical retailers.And while it’s not the most impressive source of passive income, Lowe’s dividend yield is 2.06%. On the encouraging side, its payout ratio is 30.56%, ranking high for sustainability. Looking at the Street, analysts peg LOW as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $321.67, implying over 12% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockNo matter what materializes with the debt ceiling, the healthcare sector will likely remain a viable one. Therefore, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) brings an enticing case for safe-haven stocks for debt default. For clarification, JNJ is more volatile than what you might consider a “safe” enterprise. Since the beginning of this year, JNJ slipped nearly 11%. Still, this dynamic might attract speculators.Financially, Johnson &amp; Johnson brings a decent profile to the table: nothing too grand but nothing too worrying either. In particular, the company draws the most strength from its consistent profitability. Its trailing-year net margin prints a healthy 13.22%, ranked better than 78% of the field.On the passive income side, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.81%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.5%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 44.44%, an attractively sustainable figure. Thus, it makes a powerful case for stocks to buy for U.S. debt default. Lastly, analysts peg JNJ as a moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $179.52, implying 13% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough the hydrocarbon industry may seem irrelevant considering the broader push for the electrification of transportation, combustion-powered cars may be surprisingly resilient. After all, electric vehicles tend to be expensive and the infrastructure still needs to be built out. Therefore, I like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as one of the safe-haven stocks for debt default. Basically, it enjoys a still-captive audience.Financially, Exxon Mobil delivers the goods. On the operational side, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9%, ranked better than 63.22% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate comes in at 37%, above 75.33% of sector players.Also, Exxon provides robust passive income. Its dividend yield comes in at 3.37%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 24.35%, meaning that investors should have little reason to doubt its sustainability. Thus, it makes sense if you’re seeking protection from debt default stocks. On a final note, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $129.54, implying 22% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

79,2745a287-2ebb-385c-a222-c3d065eb35cc,VLO,2023-05-28,Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) Could Become A Multi-Bagger,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-nyse-vlo-could-110107508.html,1685271667,STORY,['VLO'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Valero Energy, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.41 = US$18b ÷ (US$60b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 41%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 23% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured Valero Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Valero Energy's ROCE Trend?Valero Energy is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 311% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Valero Energy's ROCEAs discussed above, Valero Energy appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 15% to shareholders. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Valero Energy   you'll probably want to know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

80,e682612d-8035-32d4-88f6-db2a4147ebe7,ETN,2023-05-28,14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-industrial-stocks-buy-132521068.html,1685193921,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT', 'CAT', 'FDX', 'BA', 'PH', 'MMM', 'ETN', 'HON', 'GE', 'TDG', 'UNP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 14 best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) specializes in providing motion and control technologies for various markets, ranging from mobile to industrial and aerospace.The company posted strong Q3 2023 results, with quarterly sales reaching $5.1 billion. This reflected an increase of 24% from the same period last year. Furthermore, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) announced an 11% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its quarterly dividend. The stock’s annual forward dividend yield stands at 1.84% as of May 25.Harris Associates was the leading hedge fund investor in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) during Q1 2023, with a stake worth over $892 million.12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 513M Company (NYSE:MMM) is engaged in the production of safety, industrial, and consumer products.In Q1 2023, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported an adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, reflecting a YoY increase of 24%. The company attributed the improvement to reduced yearly incentive cash compensation and efficient working capital management. Furthermore, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also revealed that the company had managed to reduce its inventory levels by $500 million since August last year.Overall, 51 hedge funds held a stake in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) during Q1 2023.11. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is a Texas, United States-based producer of construction equipment and related machinery.On May 9, David Raso at Evercore ISI gave Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock a price target of $263 and assigned an Outperformed rating.

(NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the company reported a better-than-expected Q3 as demand in mining, non-residential construction and energy remained healthy through the year even as recession fears grew. Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year. Of the 943 hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q1 2023, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was held by 52 hedge funds.9. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is primarily involved in the provision of transportation, e-commerce, and business services.The number of hedge funds having a stake in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) increased from 48 in Q4 2022 to 55 in Q1 2023. Citadel Investment Group was the leading hedge fund investor in the company, with a stake worth over $467 million during the first quarter of the year.Artisan Partners shared its outlook on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years. The company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.In Q1 2023, Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) posted an EPS of $1.88, up 16% from the same period last year. Furthermore, the company recorded sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting a quarterly increase of 15% organically. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.94% as of May 25. The company’s strong business fundamentals make it one of the best industrial stocks to buy, according to hedge funds.7. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a Charlotte, North Carolina-based company involved in various businesses such as building technologies, aerospace, and productivity solutions.On May 2, John Eade at Argus gave Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) a Buy rating with a price target of $230. The analyst thinks this is an ideal opportunity to build a position in one of the best industrial stocks in the market, as the company has a strong balance sheet and a history of outperforming its targets.As of Q1 2023, 58 hedge funds reported owning a stake in Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), up from 44 in the previous quarter.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a global presence in the aerospace, defence, technology, and information security sectors.On May 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had been granted a firm-fixed-price contract valued at $750.55 million. The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries.

To skip our analysis of the industrials sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.According to McKinsey, key players in the industrials sector have generated value by emphasizing product margin optimization and engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) during the last two decades. The success of these strategies can be gauged by the fact that from 2014-2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the sector rose 13%, surpassing the usual sector-level weighted average cost of capital, which typically ranges from 8% to 10%. Furthermore, the yearly shareholder returns of the industrials sector recorded a growth of approximately 400 basis points in comparison to the last 15 years. While industrial enterprises were able to recover strongly from the recessionary period post-pandemic, they now face a difficult operating environment characterized by significant changes in customer buying patterns, labour market dynamics, and the international supply chain network.Moving into 2023, the industrials sector is expected to face similar concerns to other industries, particularly rising inflationary pressures and the heightened risk of a recession in the United States or globally. However, according to Fidelity Investments, for investors with a long-term perspective, there are three noteworthy trends within the sector that present opportunities for industrial companies based in the US. These trends include digital transformation, a growing emphasis on sustainability, and a shift towards domestic production as opposed to relying on extensive global supply chains. The growing focus on sustainability is resulting in industrial companies venturing into new avenues concerning green products and services. As per McKinsey, the value of sustainable solutions has already demonstrated its significance. For instance, the complete sustainability value chain of transport has the potential to reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion by 2030. Investors are further projected to invest an additional $4 trillion towards the development of new decarbonization ventures by 2025.Story continuesFurthermore, the industrials sector is also expected to benefit from the increased spending on national infrastructure following the pandemic. To aid the economy’s recovery, in November 2021, legislators approved a substantial $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is expected to generate a significant increase in sales for industrial companies involved in providing construction equipment and services in the coming years. The bill includes funding for various sub-sectors in the industry, including road and rail transportation, electrical equipment, aerospace, and industrial machinery. Keeping in view the aforementioned trends and developments, notable companies in the sector, such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), have been investing in advanced technologies and expanding their provision of services to cash on the pent-up demand. This has also resulted in higher profitability for companies like Transdigm Group Incorporated, as evident by their latest earnings call for Q1 2023:Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.

Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 52The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an established American multinational corporation engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of various aerospace products.Two Sigma Advisors raised its stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) by over 1000% during the first quarter of the year.

Here’s what the firm said:“After bottoming in September 2022 at less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings, shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, have rallied strongly over the past six months. The demand environment remains challenging, particularly in the Express segment due to lower volumes in Asia and Europe. A key question remains how much the demand slowdown is idiosyncratic due to the post-pandemic reopening of the international economy and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is due to a cyclical slowdown. Due to the substantial pessimism already priced into shares, it hasn’t taken much for shares to rise soundly. Better-than-expected operating results and progress on cost-cutting initiatives, including additional headcount reductions, to offset cost pressures were well-received. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”8. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) No of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a power management company with a rich history of over 100 years.

The contract relates to Lot 21 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile B-2 missiles and includes containers, tooling and test equipment, as well as spares.Here’s what Vltava Fund said about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), stocks such as TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are also amongst the best industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:14 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
84,48091596-c97b-344a-9f36-ae1972b435db,CSCO,2023-05-28,12 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-software-infrastructure-stocks-155558899.html,1685202958,STORY,"['ORCL', 'SPLK', 'CSCO', 'MSFT', 'ZS', 'HPE', 'AMZN', 'IBM', 'VMW']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best software infrastructure stocks to buy. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy.One of the industries that have benefitted directly from the technology boom over the past few years is software infrastructure. Tech and non-tech companies need software infrastructure and solutions to run their business smoothly. Companies spend a fortune on servers, migration to Cloud, network monitoring and management, internal and external communication software, software delivery and bug tracking, error handling and IT operations. All of this comes under the broader umbrella of software infrastructure.T. Rowe Price in a report published in March 2021 highlighted the importance of investing in the software infrastructure space since the firm believes companies powering the “digital economy” will enjoy massive growth in the years to come. The firm noted how the Cloud computing revolution “upended” giants like SAP and Oracle which were focused on on-premise software and forced them to make massive changes in their business. T. Rowe said these giants were challenged by companies like Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.com (T. Rowe said it was an early investor in these firms).T. Rowe explained why it’s bullish on the software infrastructure industry in these words:The suppliers of technologies enabling this transformation are a key focus of our portfolios. We pursue companies that provide the key infrastructure and services for enterprises seeking to digitalize their businesses. In our view, firms providing crucial software, cloud resources, and cybersecurity could be poised to enjoy years of solid growth as technology deepens its impact on revenue, cost savings, and competitiveness.The Cloud Infrastructure IndustryOne of the biggest segments of the software infrastructure market is the Cloud infrastructure industry. More and more companies are embracing Cloud every day for their business needs to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Cloud infrastructure market recently felt the heat due to a slowdown in Cloud spending on the back of rising inflation, analysts believe the industry will soon come out of the slowdown.Story continuesAccording to a report from Synergy Research Group, enterprise spending on Cloud infrastructure in the first quarter of 2023 stood at $63 billion, a massive increase from $10 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. The Cloud infrastructure market is highly saturated, with the top three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) taking up about 65% share.Software Infrastructure Industry Outlook: 2023 and BeyondTalking to Bloomberg earlier this year, Mandeep Singh, a senior technology analyst, said that the infrastructure software domain spans four major areas: databases, system software, DevOps and cybersecurity. Singh said that the latest pullback in tech stocks has created a lot of difference between the valuations and fundamentals of some of the top companies in the infrastructure software space. Singh believes several of these companies have “non-discretionary” capabilities and pricing power. He sees 35%-40% topline growth potential and believes these stocks won’t stay suppressed for too long since he thinks up to 70% decline in the space is not representative of the actual value of these stocks.Singh talked about the possibility of M&amp;A activity and consolidation in the infrastructure software industry in the near future since he believes major companies like Microsoft and Atlassian who are “bundling” a lot of solutions in their offerings are making services like Asana, Monday.com, Smartsheet ""redundant.""Singh is highly bullish on the cybersecurity segment of the infrastructure software market since he believes the presence of sophisticated attacks and the “fear of losing intellectual property” are forcing spending in the sector and we are expected to see robust growth in the industry. He especially talked about CrowdStrike and Zscaler and highlighted their “positive revisions.”Perhaps the biggest player in the Cloud infrastructure domain in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has big plans for the future, especially after the arrival of generative AI capabilities on the scene. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy has been emphasizing the growth opportunities AWS has over the past few months. He talked about Cloud infrastructure and AI-related capabilities in the company’s latest earnings call:One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise’ infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it’s best for customers long term, we’ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We’ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we’re seeing, and I’ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we’re seeing in AWS.The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it’s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we’re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example.For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds updated as of the end of March 2023 and picked 12 software infrastructure stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Some notable names include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW).Best Software Infrastructure Stocks to Buy12. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides software-define infrastructure (SDI) solutions for businesses to help them manage their networking, storage, automation, and overall software development and deployment. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is known for HPE OneView, which is an integrated IT infrastructure software that uses automation to solve key software infrastructure problems.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 37 hedge funds had stakes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) at the end of the first quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) during this period was Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $208.4 million stake in the company.11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) focuses on the security side of software infrastructure since it’s primarily a Cloud security company. It’s known for its Cloud infrastructure modernization solution called The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange. Zscaler also provides Infrastructure as Code services to provide Cloud security.38 out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of hedge funds had stakes in Zscaler, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ZS) was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $122 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”9. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49International Business Machines Corp.

The key drivers of improved growth come from the company’s Software-as-a-Service applications and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle’s software applications power the Enterprise Resource Planning and Human Capital Management functions of large and small-to-medium sized businesses and are growing in the mid-teens. OCI is a differentiated cloud infrastructure provider that is gaining share due to its strong value proposition in speed, performance, and security. In addition, we believe that the company’s operating margins will improve from scale benefits in OCI and cost efficiencies from its recent acquisition of Cerner.”6. VMware, Inc.
