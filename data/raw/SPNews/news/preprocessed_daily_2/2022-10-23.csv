0,c9f85d7a-034a-370a-a547-69c2be316274,TXN,2022-10-23,7 Semiconductor Stock Predictions for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-semiconductor-stock-predictions-2023-204216074.html,1666212136,STORY,"['LRCX', 'TXN', 'MU', 'TSM', 'INTC', 'AMAT', 'AMD']","[Semiconductors are used in virtually all of the most important emerging technologies. Data centers, gaming, and electric cars all require a substantial number of chips. In fact, electronic components make up nearly 40% of internal combustion vehicles. Additionally, semiconductor chips play a vital role in the electronic equipment such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones that we use every day.Thus, it’s not surprising to note that demand for chips surged in 2020 and 2021. That said, supply chain difficulties made it difficult to get the chips where they needed to be. This caused many chip stocks to move down from record highs in 2022.Now, with many manufacturers overestimating their need for chips, these semiconductor stocks have been hit hard. While some argue this has allowed chipmakers to focus on the next generation of chips that will be in high demand, this is still a sector with some risk. That said, as more attention is paid to bringing semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, 2023 may be the start of another semiconductor super cycle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, here are seven semiconductor predictions and supporting stocks for 2023.TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$63.68TXNTexas Instruments$151.98INTCIntel$25.98MUMicron Technology$52.87LRCXLam Research$328.64AMATApplied Materials$76.78TERTeradyne$72.63Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)image of TSM semiconductor office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIf you’re going to pick one semiconductor stock, you can’t do much better than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). This company is the largest pure play in the semiconductor foundry/manufacturing space. Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures semiconductors for other companies, notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as other chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).This gives investors in TSM stock diversification within the sector. But as far as semiconductor stock predictions go, I’ll just say that the stock will be at the forefront of the chip market, when it turns around. Accordingly, with the sector’s focus now shifting to next-generation chips, that turnaround could come sometime in 2023.Story continuesThat doesn’t make TSM stock an easy buy right now. It’s down 47% for the year. That’s more than double the drop in the S&amp;P 500 this year. But at a price-earnings ratio of just 14-times earnings and a dividend with a current yield of approximately 2.9%, Taiwan Semiconductor should have a place on your watch list as we head into 2023.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock is down 19% this year. The reason can be traced to the automotive sector.The company generates the bulk of its revenue from three primary sectors: automotive, industrial, and personal electronic. Although investors are most familiar with the company’s footprint in the personal electronic sector (i.e. the calculator company), it’s the automotive sector that gives it a real presence in the semiconductor space.As far as semiconductor stock predictions go, 2023 is likely to be the year when supply chains get untangled. That may lead to a glut on the market that will temporarily be a headwind for TXN stock. But with battery electric vehicles making up only 5% of the nation’s vehicles, the future addressable market will be huge.TXN stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 16.5-times which makes it slightly more expensive than the sector average. However, the company does pay a dividend that currently yields over 3%, and the company has increased it for the last 18 consecutive years.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIt’s one thing for the United States to say it wants to bring home semiconductor manufacturing. It’s another thing for companies to be open to doing business stateside. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trying to make that a reality, but the company’s $20 billion plant in Ohio won’t be open for business anytime in 2023.That isn’t preventing the company from attempting to spend money to make that growth happen. In February 2022, Intel paid over $5 billion for the Israeli semiconductor company, Tower Semiconductor. The company was widely criticized for overpaying for Tower.More recently, the company is raising more eyebrows by bringing Mobileye public during a bear market. Given the fact that Mobileye would likely be a highly sought-after stock once the market turns around, this acquisition is the latest to raise concerns about Intel’s balance sheet.However, with a price-earnings ratio of 5.5-times and a dividend yield that is over 5%, INTC stock looks to be falling into the “too cheap to ignore” category.Micron Technology (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has been one of the biggest losers in this sector in 2022. Currently, MU stock is down around 47% for the year. However, the company just announced it broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in its hometown of Boise, Idaho, the first new plant of its type built in the United States in the last 20 years.What might be concerning investors is that the company continues to spend heavily on capital expenditures. In its last fiscal year, Micron spent more than $12 billion, which represented 39% of its revenue. However, the company believes these investments will pay off in the future.That said, will investors believe it? One of my semiconductor stock predictions is that they will. In fact, with a price-earnings ratio of 7-times along with a consensus price target that suggests that the stock has a 36% upside, MU stock presents an intriguing buying opportunity for patient investors.Lam Research (LRCX)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is another picks-and-shovels play in the semiconductor industry. The company makes the equipment necessary to make semiconductor wafers. This puts it on the leading edge of the semiconductor supply chain. The company is a leader and pioneer in the dry etch process. This allows the company to remove material with high-tech equipment.Unsurprisingly, the company has been posting consistent year-over-year gains in both revenue and earnings. However, one of the most compelling reasons to own LRCX stock is that the company is based in the United States, and that makes it an easy winner as semiconductor companies look to shift to fabricating their chips within our borders.LRCX stock has an attractive valuation at around 10-times earnings, and the company pays a dividend yield over 2%.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a competitor of Lam Research. And the fact that I’m putting both companies on this list suggests that one of my semiconductor stock predictions is that U.S. companies will broadly benefit from export controls.In the short term, the company will likely suffer due to slowing demand as well as competition from China.  However, Applied Materials expects to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% over time.Additionally, as Alex Sirois wrote recently, investors can take advantage of the stock’s year-to-date drop which is positioning it as a value stock within the tech sector. Given the company pays a dividend that currently yields 1.4% yield with a payout of $1.04 on an annual basis, this is a stock with strong fundamentals right now.Teradyne (TER)Artificial Intelligence (AI),machine learning with data mining technology on virtual dachboard.Business team meeting. Photo professional investor working new start up project. Finance task. ATER stockSource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comThe last stock on this list is not a semiconductor stock at all. Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) manufactures testing equipment that is used for semiconductors. Teradyne is poised to benefit from the next generation of 3 nanometer semiconductor manufacturing technology.This is a stock that proves boring can be beautiful. As you look at the company’s revenue and earnings over any length of time, you just see a company that delivers consistent results. What’s more, over half of that revenue comes from semiconductor testing.This consistency is reflected in the fact that the stock has 98% institutional ownership. That means it’s included in a lot of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).That hasn’t stopped the stock from being down 55% in 2022. But the stock is trading at a price-earnings ratio of just over 15-times earnings and even pays a modest dividend that currently yields right around 0.6%.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

By comparison, the widely followed S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) lost 24.70%. The semiconductor sector’s steep under-performance spells trouble ahead. Chip companies are already cutting back on what is normally heavy spending on capital expenditures.Chip firms are bracing for softness that began earlier this year to continue for the rest of 2022. Chips are down because markets are betting that demand for semiconductors will persist into 2023. This speculation is too bearish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChips power everything from smartphones, computers and electric vehicles, to centralized servers. Demand for data storage, wider communications bandwidth, and computing problems will not slow.Aggressive investors need to include semiconductor stocks to buy in their growth portfolio. The slowdown may continue for a brief quarter or two. Eventually, consumer spending will rebound as the economy improves.AMATApplied Materials $76.56INTCIntel$25.87LRCXLam Research$328.87MRVLMarvell$37.68NVDANvidia$119.92QRVOQorvo$80.62TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$63.36Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy on weakness. The company cut its fourth-quarter net sales by around $400 million, explaining that the United States export regulation on chips sold in China will hurt revenue.Applied will pursue additional export licenses and authorizations. Sales will decline again by $400 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Fortunately, the market priced in the impact of the new regulations.The chip giant benefits from the strong demand exceeding supply. For example, president and CEO Gary Dickerson met with top chief executive officers. The leaders agreed that the company cannot supply enough to meet demand.Story continuesIn the longer term, Applied has billions in investments ready. It positioned the company to prepare for major positive inflections ahead.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) will reportedly cut thousands of jobs. It needs to align costs with the slowdown in the personal computer market.Unfortunately, the company will not need as much marketing and sales efforts to chase weaker demand in end markets. During the pandemic, customers and corporations bought computers to support working from home.The PC upgrade cycle started during the 2020-2021 pandemic. Now it needs to pivot beyond selling central computing chips. Late last month, Intel said that Moore’s law is not dead. In effect, CEO Gelsinger’s reference to the law ushered Intel’s entry into mainstream graphics cards.Intel’s GPU could not come sooner. GPU suppliers are offering minimal discounts on the mid-range card. Consumers may buy Intel’s Arc A770 GPU for $329. The GPU will compete with the Nvidia 3060 Ti.Since this model is in limited supply, Intel may sell its product at a better price. Strong demand for the new GPUs makes INTC one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the long term.Lam Research (LRCX)Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) raised its dividend by 15% to $0.225 a share in its last quarterly payment. The company intends to increase dividends annually., making it one of the semiconductor stocks to buy for regular income.Although the stock dividend of 2.19% does not compare to Intel’s 5.63% dividend yield, Lam Research has strong growth prospects today.The chip sector has been working through a supply chain disruption for around nine months. Lam Research believes the strong NAND market will lift its results.Layer counts are increasing. As Lam deposits more films on the wafer, it increases the time to output. The denser product should sustain profit margins. Furthermore, the company is investing in its business to maintain its competitive edge.In December, the company will issue its guidance for 2023. The memory chip market will weaken. Still, price declines for memory will help clear the excess supply.In addition, the industry will invest less in factories. This gives LRCX stock a boost. The company will enable new node conversions. This should help the company beat expectations.Marvell (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) posted record revenue of $1.52 billion in its Q2/2023 report.Marvell benefits from healthy demand for its products. All but consumer hard drive disk drive demand is outpacing supply. In addition, Marvell has new products ahead. This should support its long-term growth prospects.The cloud-optimized silicon development is a growth opportunity for the company. It has new design wins that it achieved in the last few years. This will add $400 million in revenue next year. The year after that, Marvell will earn $800 million in incremental revenue.In the 5G business, strong adoption will fuel the company’s growth. In the automotive segment, customers require Ethernet solutions. Top automotive OEMs require Marvell’s technology. Fortunately, customers require the designs in both gas-powered and electric vehicles.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently launched a powerful graphics card for the high-end gamer.Retailers are pricing the RTX 4090 card between $1,599 and $1,699. The $100 price above the suggested retail price suggests that the product enjoys strong market demand.At the time it announced the 4090, Nvidia announced an RTX 4080 12GB. At a glance, the product looked like it had less memory than the RTX 4080 16GB. Experts noticed the performance difference and criticized the product name. Nvidia listened. It will “unlaunch” the product and will relaunch it at a later date.The company is likely producing limited units of a high-end product. It wants the market to sell out of the current RTX 30 series first.Nvidia’s revenue warning sent NVDA stock lower. It expects revenue will fall by around $5 billion. The firm revised its growth outlook. It did not see a strong back-to-school demand bump. The weak sales may continue this holiday. Investors should consider accumulating shares as the company works down the excess inventory.Qorvo (QRVO)The logo for Qorvo (QRVO) is shown on a sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is heavily reliant on smartphone sales. High inflation rates are hurting consumers’ disposable income. If they delay iPhone upgrades, it would hurt Qorvo, which depends on 33% of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Investors may take advantage of the lower price-to-earnings multiples on QRVO stock. It is a diversified firm. For example, it has diversification in growth product areas.The cellular market benefits from multiyear content and integration. In connectivity and sensing, Qorvo’s portfolio has multiple connectivity standards. This includes Matter, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband.Markets overlook Qorvo’s high-performance analog segment. Instead of appreciating the upgrade cycle and 5G infrastructure growth, stock traders react to its stock price.Qorvo will navigate past the macrocosmic headwind by continuing its design efforts. It will increase volume output as the supply conditions strengthen. Investors may time the low point in its business. The Android business is weakest during the December quarter.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)image of TSM semiconductor office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a highly profitable manufacturer. It posted gross margins of 60.4% in its Q3 report. Free cash flow is very strong. Markets refuse to acknowledge the business strength. TSM stock is down by 50% year to date.In 2023, TSM expects challenges from higher depreciation costs, higher inflationary costs, and unfavorable semiconductor cyclicality. Still, its overseas fab expansions are long-term investments that benefit the company’s health. The company will closely work with its customers to support them strategically. Internally, it will find ways to improve costs.TSM is cautious about the PC and smartphone market. The market’s softness in the quarter weighed on results. Utilization will be under pressure. During that time, it will work with customers to develop radio frequency and connectivity solutions. This increases TSM’s addressable market.After customers will work through weak demand, TSM’s utilization will recover. Investors should consider buying a small position before that happens.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider Marc Oken made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$155 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

7,39623cb9-41ab-321a-b76d-17c188a50894,IT,2022-10-23,Why We Like The Returns At Gartner (NYSE:IT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-returns-gartner-nyse-144257638.html,1666449777,STORY,['IT'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Gartner's (NYSE:IT) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Gartner:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$6.6b - US$3.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Gartner has an ROCE of 30%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Gartner roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Gartner compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Gartner's ROCE Trending?Gartner has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 470% over the trailing five years. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 28% less capital than it was five years ago. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.Story continuesOn a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 48% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. Given it's pretty high ratio, we'd remind investors that having current liabilities at those levels can bring about some risks in certain businesses.The Bottom Line On Gartner's ROCEFrom what we've seen above, Gartner has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 132% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Gartner can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Gartner (at least 1 which is potentially serious)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:CRM) stock gained 13% last week, insiders who sold US$106m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$173, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$53m worth of shares, at about US$182 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$160). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, currently worth about US$5.0b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Salesforce Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Salesforce insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Salesforce, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Salesforce has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

However, by copying these designs you are committing plagiarism, and as you know, plagiarism is illegal and immoral. At least admit it. And I hope you compensate the damage to the original communities that do this work with love and not for profit millionaires.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In a follow-up post Friday, Gutiérrez Müller shed some light on the origin story of the indigenous garments noting (as translated from Spanish): “The serapes, a mixture of Spanish and Indigenous garments, are originally from Contla. Centuries ago, some contlecos went to settle in Saltillo and continued the textile tradition there. In the backstrap loom, the lamb’s wool threads are woven with tequesquite [a natural mineral salt]. The dyes are natural, such as walnut shells or cochineal….In 2018 the @congresodetlaxcala declared the sarape ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of the State of Tlaxcala.’”Ralph Lauren Corp. issued a corporate apology Thursday that did not address Gutiérrez Müller’s call to see things made right with the communities the products pulled from:“We are surprised to learn that this product is being sold. When our team discovered months ago that this was in our product pipeline, we issued a stern directive to remove the item from all channels. We are conducting an urgent audit to determine how this item landed on a sales floor after that directive and ensure it is removed immediately….We are deeply sorry this happened and, as always, we are open to dialogue about how we can do better.”Story continuesDespite what may have happened in the past, Ralph Lauren said in June that “any new product featuring traditional Indigenous design motifs following our summer 2023 season will be created under a model of credit and collaboration, which we are piloting through our Artist in Residence program with intentions to scale it in the future.”The company also added at the time that it is “deepening our mandatory cultural awareness trainings.”Mexico and, in particular, its Secretary of Culture Alejandra Frausto Guerrero, has been vigilant about calling out fashion labels, including Isabel Marant and Louis Vuitton, for appropriating designs from its communities.On Thursday, Frausto Guerrero tweeted, addressing the Ralph Lauren issue: “Identity symbols are not merchandise.”She also said the artisans from Contla and Salitillo will be present at this year’s Original event, a reimagined trade show in Mexico that launched last year where artisan communities, as she notes, “are the only protagonists,” and the ones promoting their creations to engage in collaborations with designers. The aim is to put an end to cultural appropriation, which has been a long-standing issue in fashion.Original will take place at the Complejo Cultural Los Pinos cultural center in Mexico City from Nov. 17 to 20.]"

In the current environment, finding multibagger high-growth stocks that offer the potential for huge returns but also have a defensive posture is no easy feat. But it is possible.The bear doesn’t appear to be going into hibernation anytime soon. On the bright side, investors stand to benefit from the lower valuations it has brought with it. Sure, stocks can always get cheaper. But, over the long term, equities are one of the best wealth-generating mechanisms we have.Therefore, investors should consider easing into positions in these high-growth stocks with defensive business models and the potential for multibagger returns over the next three years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$67.75THTarget Hospitality$11.62MROMarathon Petroleum$28.02Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comEnergy is crucial, making the sector attractive for long-term investors looking to put capital to work right now. My top pick among energy stocks is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which has also attracted the attention of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares hand over fist, and it seems he hasn’t lost his touch. OXY stock is up more than 130% year to date.Buffett and others no doubt like Occidental’s diversification. In addition to the development of oil and gas properties, the company manufactures and markets basic chemicals. This portion of its business is often overlooked, but it is a vital driver of profitability and cash flows. Plus, as with energy, demand for chemicals will not disappear with a recession.No matter what transpires on the macroeconomic level, I think Occidental could be the best-positioned company in this market. It’s my top pick for defensive investors looking for growth right now.Target Hospitality (TH)Woman standing in hotel room with luggage looking at the view. Hotel stocks.Source: Boyloso / ShutterstockPerhaps a less-conventional pick for a list of high-growth stocks is Target Hospitality (NASDAQ:TH), which focuses on the rather boring rental real estate market. The company owns, constructs and operates a wide range of rental accommodations, including hotels and temporary housing units, primarily serving the energy and government sectors.Story continuesThere is tremendous value in the company’s vertically integrated business model. Target Hospitality provides not only rental accommodations but hospitality services as well, such as culinary, concierge, laundry and security services, in addition to recreational facilities.TH stock is up an eye-popping 230% so far this year. Much of this can be attributed to the massive run-up in shares in early July. This followed news the company expanded its lease and services agreement with the government to provide support for around 6,400 displaced people, about 60% more than the original contract.“The recurring lease and infrastructure enhancement revenue will generate a minimum of $390 million for Target Hospitality annually,” wrote Investor Business Daily’s Harrison Miller. “Along with the services revenue component, the contract could provide a maximum of $575 million in annual value.”After bagging the deal, management upped its full-year revenue forecast by more than 50% to $505 million at the midpoint of their range. That would be a record for the company and represent sales growth of more than 73% over 2021.TH is one high-growth stock that should be on investors’ watch list, at the very least, right now.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comLongtime readers know I have been bullish on energy stocks for some time. While the sector peaked in early June, I don’t foresee the gains stopping yet. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is one of the best high-growth stocks in this market of late.Rising energy prices have shifted the paradigm for this sector in a big way. In 2020, no one wanted to touch energy stocks. Today, the cash-flow-generating machines stand out from the crowd. This is particularly true of companies like Marathon, which have improved their balance sheets and provided strong returns for investors. Notably, Marathon has done this while becoming increasingly ESG compliant.For the second quarter, Marathon reported record quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion and net income of $966 million. For a company worth roughly $19 billion, that amounts to nearly 20 quarters’ worth of free cash flow.  In other words, the stock is cheap, even after its 70%-plus advance this year.Bottom line: MRO stock is a great way to gain exposure to this high-growth sector right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

(NYSE:PM) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-institutional-ownership-philip-morris-110057175.html,1666522857,STORY,['PM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Philip Morris International. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Philip Morris International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$222m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Philip Morris International   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Schlumberger with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Schlumberger's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Impressively, Schlumberger's EPS catapulted from US$1.18 to US$2.10, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 77%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Schlumberger is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.0 percentage points to 14%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Schlumberger's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Schlumberger, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$159m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Schlumberger Worth Keeping An Eye On?Schlumberger's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Schlumberger is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Schlumberger that you need to take into consideration.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

The sustained strength in crude prices (at around $85 a barrel) and robust product demand has lifted the fuel refining space and contributed to the share price movement in Par Pacific. The recent buyout of ExxonMobil’s Montana downstream facility also had a positive effect on the company.This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +159.2%. Revenues are expected to be $1.74 billion, up 32.7% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Par Petroleum, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$23m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$67.61. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of TJX Companies shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like TJX Companies better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.TJX Companies Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of TJX Companies shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. TJX Companies insiders own about US$135m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At TJX Companies Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought TJX Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since TJX Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing TJX Companies. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for TJX Companies (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.But note: TJX Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

26,25f1aefa-52cc-3cf6-9d7c-b6dd75c9c13a,MA,2022-10-23,When Should You Buy Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-ma-140015914.html,1666447215,STORY,['MA'],"[Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$360 and falling to the lows of US$283. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Mastercard's current trading price of US$302 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Mastercard’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Mastercard What Is Mastercard Worth?Great news for investors – Mastercard is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $423.29, but it is currently trading at US$302 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mastercard’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Mastercard generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Mastercard's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 55%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

At 52 weeks following kidney transplant, trial results met the primary endpoint demonstrating that PREVYMIS was effective and non-inferior to valganciclovir for preventing CMV disease -- 10.4% (n=30) of participants who received PREVYMIS developed CMV disease versus 11.8% (n=35) of participants on valganciclovir (stratum adjusted difference = -1.4, [95% CI, -6.5, 3.8]). In a pre-specified safety analysis, PREVYMIS-treated participants had significantly less myelotoxicity, as measured by rates of leukopenia or neutropenia, compared to valganciclovir-treated participants; 26.0% (n=76) versus 64.0% (n=190), (95% CI, -45.1, -30.3; p-value &lt;0.0001). The findings from this trial were presented during a late-breaking oral session at the IDWeek Annual Meeting (Abstract # LB2307). Merck plans to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) with these data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of this year.PREVYMIS is a first-in-class antiviral agent that was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2017 and is indicated for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). PREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism. PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.Story continues""CMV disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. Valganciclovir has been the most commonly used drug for CMV prophylaxis in this setting, but myelotoxicity (especially neutropenia and leukopenia) is an important limitation of this drug. Myelotoxicities can be difficult to manage in patients who are already receiving complex treatment regimens with other drugs that also have bone marrow suppressive effects,"" said Dr. Ajit P. Limaye, director, Solid Organ Transplant Infectious Disease Program at University of Washington School of Medicine. ""I was excited to see these trial results that showed that the efficacy of PREVYMIS for prevention of CMV disease in kidney transplant patients was similar to the current standard of care treatment (valganciclovir), but with significantly less toxicity.""""There is a need for additional CMV prophylactic options for kidney transplant recipients to help patients reduce risk of opportunistic infections,"" said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president, vaccines and infectious diseases, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These new study results in adult kidney transplant patients are encouraging and demonstrate the potential of PREVYMIS to prevent CMV disease with a therapy that showed lower rates of neutropenia and leukopenia versus the comparator.""About the Phase 3 trial and efficacy results for PREVYMIS in kidney transplant recipientsThe objective of this Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was to evaluate PREVYMIS versus valganciclovir in preventing CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk for CMV disease. In the trial, 601 participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either 480 mg of PREVYMIS once a day (n=301) or 900 mg of valganciclovir once a day (n=300) within 7 days post-kidney transplant through 28 weeks (~200 days) post-transplant, with follow-up through 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with CMV disease adjudicated by an independent committee that was blinded to treatment assignment through Week 52 post-kidney transplant. The median age of participants was 52 years in the PREVYMIS study group and 51 years in the valganciclovir study group. Participants were stratified by use/non-use of lymphocyte-depleting induction immunotherapy.At 52 weeks following transplant, 10.4% (n=30) of the PREVYMIS group had CMV disease versus 11.8% (n=35) of the valganciclovir group (stratum adjusted difference = -1.4, [95% CI, -6.5, 3.8]), meeting non-inferiority for the trial’s primary endpoint. Efficacy was comparable across all subgroups (age, gender, race and geography). For the secondary endpoint of adjudicated CMV disease at 28 weeks following transplant, 0% (n=0) of PREVYMIS participants and 1.7% (n=5) of valganciclovir participants had CMV disease (stratum adjusted difference = -1.7 [95% CI, -3.4, 0.1]).Key safety resultsPREVYMIS had a more favorable safety profile compared to valganciclovir, with fewer drug-related adverse events and study drug discontinuations due to adverse events reported in the PREVYMIS group compared to the valganciclovir group. The incidence of leukopenia (decrease in leukocytes, or white blood cells) and neutropenia (decrease in of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell) was lower with PREVYMIS than with valganciclovir:The treatment difference in leukopenia/neutropenia was 38% lower in the PREVYMIS group versus the valganciclovir group and statistically significant;Neutropenia measured during treatment through week 28 post-transplant (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/µL) was reported in 4.1% (n=12) of the PREVYMIS group versus 19.5% (n=58) of the valganciclovir group (95% CI, -20.7, -10.5);Leukopenia and neutropenia leading to discontinuation of study drug during the 28-week treatment phase was reported in 1.0% (n=3) in the PREVYMIS group and 5.4% (n=16) in the valganciclovir group, and 1.4% (n=4) in the PREVYMIS group and 1.7% (n=5) in the valganciclovir group, respectively.Additional safety information from the trial:Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 19.9% (n=58) of PREVYMIS participants and 35.0% (n=104) of valganciclovir participants through Week 28 post kidney transplant (95% CI, −22.2, −8.0). Serious drug-related AEs were reported in 1.4% (n=4) of PREVYMIS participants and 5.1% (n=15) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI, −7.0, −0.9);Discontinuations due to an AE: 4.1% (n=12) in the PREVYMIS group and 13.5% (n=40) in the valganciclovir group (95% CI −14.1, −4.9);Discontinuation due to a serious AE: 2.1% (n=6) of PREVYMIS participants versus 4.7% (n=14) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −5.9, 0.3);Discontinuation due to a drug-related AE: 2.7% (n=8) of PREVYMIS participants versus 8.8% (n=26) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −10.1, −2.4);Discontinuation due to serious drug-related AE: 0.7% (n=2) of PREVYMIS participants versus 2.4% (n=7) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −4.2, 0.4);Two participants (0.7%) in the PREVYMIS group and one participant in the valganciclovir group (0.3%) died (95% CI, −1.3, 2.2).About the trial evaluating 200 days of therapy with PREVYMIS in HSCT recipientsMerck recently concluded another Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis with PREVYMIS when extended from 100 to 200 days in CMV-seropositive recipients (R+) following an HSCT. This Phase 3 trial (NCT03930615) evaluated whether extending CMV prophylaxis with PREVYMIS from 100 days to 200 days post-HSCT resulted in additional benefit compared to placebo in patients at high risk for clinically significant CMV infection (CS-CMVi) beyond 100-days post-HSCT. This trial met its primary endpoint, which was the proportion of participants with CS-CMVi from Week 14 (~100 days) through Week 28 (~200 days) post-HSCT. Merck is planning to present these data at a scientific congress and also plans to submit a sNDA with these data to the U.S. FDA by the end of this year.Selected Safety Information about PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism. PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREVYMIS therapy; review concomitant medications during PREVYMIS therapy; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with PREVYMIS and concomitant medications.The cardiac adverse event rate (regardless of investigator-assessed causality) was higher in subjects receiving PREVYMIS than placebo (13% vs 6%). The most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia (reported in 4% PREVYMIS subjects and 2% placebo subjects) and atrial fibrillation (reported in 3% PREVYMIS subjects and 1% placebo subjects). Among those subjects who experienced one or more cardiac adverse events, 85% of PREVYMIS and 92% of placebo subjects had events reported as mild or moderate in severity.The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of PREVYMIS-treated HSCT recipients and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo were nausea (27% vs 23%), diarrhea (26% vs 24%), vomiting (19% vs 14%), peripheral edema (14% vs 9%), cough (14% vs 10%), headache (14% vs 9%), fatigue (13% vs 11%), and abdominal pain (12% vs 9%).The most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea (occurring in 2% of PREVYMIS subjects and 1% of placebo subjects). Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation.Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are inhibitors of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) transporters may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations.Co-administration of PREVYMIS with midazolam results in increased midazolam plasma concentration. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are CYP3A substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations of co-administered CYP3A substrates.The magnitude of CYP3A- and OATP1B1/3-mediated drug interactions on co-administered drugs may be different when PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine. See the prescribing information for cyclosporine for information on drug interactions with cyclosporine.If dose adjustments of concomitant medications are made due to treatment with PREVYMIS, doses should be readjusted after PREVYMIS treatment is completed.Established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions may occur with co-administration of PREVYMIS and drug/drug classes (without cyclosporine, unless otherwise indicated), including, but not limited to, the following:Anti-arrhythmic agentsAmiodarone: increases amiodarone concentrationAnticoagulantsWarfarin: decreases warfarin concentrationAnticonvulsantsPhenytoin: decreases phenytoin concentrationAntidiabetic agentsGlyburide: increases glyburide concentrationRepaglinide: increases repaglinide concentrationRosiglitazone: increases rosiglitazone concentrationAntifungalsVoriconazole: decreases voriconazole concentrationAntimycobacterialRifampin: decreases letermovir concentrationAntipsychoticsPimozide: increases pimozide concentration; co-administration is contraindicatedErgot alkaloidsErgotamine: increases ergotamine concentration; co-administration is contraindicatedDihydroergotamine: increases dihydroergotamine concentration; co-administration is contraindicatedHMG-CoA reductase inhibitorsPitavastatin, Simvastatin: increases HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors concentration; co-administration is contraindicated when PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporineAtorvastatin: increases atorvastatin concentrationFluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin: increases HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors concentrationImmunosuppressantsCyclosporine: increases both cyclosporine and letermovir concentrationsSirolimus: increases sirolimus concentrationTacrolimus: increases tacrolimus concentrationProton pump inhibitorsOmeprazole: decreases omeprazole concentrationPantoprazole: decreases pantoprazole concentrationCYP3A substrate examplesAlfentanil, fentanyl, midazolam and quinidine: may increase CYP3A substrate concentrationPimozide and ergot alkaloids are contraindicatedThe safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS (letermovir) in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.For patients with CLcr greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on renal impairment. The safety of PREVYMIS in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown.No dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.About CMV and TreatmentCMV is a common virus that infects people of all ages. Many adults in the United States are CMV seropositive, meaning they have CMV antibodies in their blood, indicating a previous exposure to or primary infection with CMV. People with normal immune systems rarely develop CMV symptoms after initial infection, with the virus typically remaining inactive or latent in the body for life. A weakened immune system may give the virus a chance to reactivate, potentially leading to symptomatic disease or a secondary infection due to other pathogens. When a transplant recipient who is CMV seronegative receives an organ from a donor who is CMV seropositive, the transplant recipient can get CMV from the donated organ. CMV disease can lead to end-organ damage, including gastrointestinal tract disease, pneumonia or retinitis. Transplant recipients who develop CMV infection post-transplant are at increased risk for transplant failure and death. CMV prophylaxis with certain existing antivirals has been associated with drug-specific effects, including myelosuppression and renal toxicity, in HSCT recipients.About PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS is the only drug approved in the United States for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adults who are CMV-seropositive and have received an allogeneic HSCT. PREVYMIS is also approved in more than 60 countries outside of the United States, including EU member states, Canada, Japan and China. PREVYMIS is a first-in-class non-nucleoside CMV inhibitor (3,4 dihydro-quinazolines) and inhibits viral replication by specifically targeting the viral terminase complex. Cross resistance is not likely with drugs outside of this class. PREVYMIS is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors. These DNA polymerase inhibitors are fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to PREVYMIS. PREVYMIS has no activity against other viruses.Under an agreement signed in 2012, Merck (through a subsidiary) purchased worldwide rights to develop and commercialize letermovir from AiCuris GmbH &amp; Co KG (www.aicuris.com).About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

(NYSE:NKE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NIKE. View our latest analysis for NIKE ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NIKE?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.NIKE already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NIKE, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. NIKE is not owned by hedge funds. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Philip Knight (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 17% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NIKEWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of NIKE, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$28b stake in this US$138b business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NIKE better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$1.0m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$44.83, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$125m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

Selling at an average price of US$51.22, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Pfizer Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Pfizer shares in the last quarter.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$220m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, PNC Financial Services Group makes money, and is growing profits.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 40%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 23%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 22% in the last three years. But it's up 8.0% in the last week. But this could be related to the strong market, with stocks up around 4.5% in the same time.While the last year has been tough for Walt Disney shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Walt Disney share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Walt Disney managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Walt Disney in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 23% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 40%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.5% per year over half a decade.

51,72dd792e-cfb3-3850-bd6d-f486b2a11257,NDAQ,2022-10-23,Nasdaq halts IPOs of small Chinese companies as it probes stock rallies,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-halts-ipos-small-chinese-153945145.html,1666453185,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[By Echo WangNEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc has put the brakes on initial public offering (IPO) preparations of at least four small Chinese companies while it investigates short-lived stock rallies of such firms following their debuts, according to lawyers and bankers who work on such stock launches.The stock exchange operator's actions come amid a surge in the shares of Chinese companies that raise small amounts, typically $50 million or less, in their IPO. These stocks rise as much as 2,000% in their debuts, only to nosedive in the days that follow, bruising investors who are bold enough to speculate on penny stocks.Douglas Ellenoff, a corporate and securities attorney at Ellenoff Grossman &amp; Schole LLP, said he was informed by the Nasdaq that certain IPOs will not be allowed to proceed ""until they determined what has been the aberrational trading activity in certain Chinese issuers earlier this year.""""These were last-minute phone calls, just as we thought we were going to go somewhere with the deals,"" Ellenoff said.Nasdaq started asking the advisers of small Chinese IPO candidates questions in mid-September. The questions concerned the identity of their existing shareholders, where they reside, how much they are investing and if they were offered interest-free debt so they can participate, according to one of the bankers, Dan McClory, who is head of equity capital markets at Boustead Securities.The lawyers and bankers spoke to Reuters on condition that the names of the four companies whose IPOs were halted not be disclosed.It is not clear what action the Nasdaq will take once it completes its probe and whether all or some of the halted IPOs will be allowed to continue. A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment.Seven sources who work on IPOs of small Chinese companies spoke to Reuters on the condition that neither they nor their clients be identified. These sources said that the ephemeral stock rallies were caused by a few overseas investors who concealed their identities and snapped up most of the shares in the offerings, creating the perception that the debuts were in demand.Story continuesAs a result, Chinese IPOs in the United States have returned this year on average a staggering 426% in their first day of trading, compared with 68% for all other IPOs, according to data from Dealogic.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other U.S. financial regulators have yet to announce a case of successfully prosecuting such pump-and-dump schemes because Chinese companies and their overseas bankers have so far been effective in carrying them out secretly, the seven sources said.An SEC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.LOOPHOLESNasdaq's intervention underscores how liquidity standards it adopted in the last three years to prevent stock manipulation in small IPOs have loopholes that Chinese companies are exploiting. The rules dictate that a company going public should have at least 300 investors holding at least 100 shares each, totaling a minimum of $2,500.Yet these requirements have not been sufficient to prevent trading manipulation in some penny stocks. Small Chinese companies have been attracted to Nasdaq's exchange rather than the New York Stock Exchange because the former has traditionally been the venue of red-hot technology startups - an image these companies often try to project.""Almost all of these microcap IPOs are 'story' stocks, where the promoters try to convince unsophisticated retail investors that this could be the next Moderna or this could be the next Facebook,"" said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor who studies IPOs.There have been 57 listings of small Chinese companies in the last five years, up from 17 listings in the prior five years, according to Dealogic. So far this year there have been nine such listings despite the U.S. IPO market facing its worst drought in nearly two decades due to market volatility fueled by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to fight inflation.McClory said the trend highlights the looser regulatory requirements for listings in the United States compared with China. ""It is virtually impossible for these companies to list onshore in China, and now the Hong Kong market has completely shut down as well,"" he said.(Reporting by Echo Wang in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew Lewis)]"

According to multiple reports, Third Point has now taken a position worth about $1 billion in CL stock. That news has caught the attention of investors, who bid up the price of Colgate-Palmolive shares this morning. As of this writing, however, CL is treading slightly in the red.Prior to today, CL stock was down 14% year-to-date (YTD) at $72.92 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat’s Happening With CL Stock?CNBC reports that Loeb has taken a sizable stake in CL stock because he sees value in the company’s fast-growing pet food subsidiary, Hill’s Pet Nutrition. Loeb reportedly feels that, as a stand-alone business, Hill’s could be worth $20 billion based on its 2023 financials.Headquartered in New York City, Colgate-Palmolive makes a number of popular consumer brands, including Colgate toothpaste, Speed Stick deodorant, a variety of dish soaps and more. Yet, despite the success the company has had with Hill’s Pet Nutrition and its other products, CL stock has barely moved. Over the last five years, shares have gained less than 1%.Why It MattersThe fact that Dan Loeb has acquired a big stake in Colgate-Palmolive via Third Point is a vote of confidence in CL stock. Loeb, who has an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion, specializes in value investing. Third Point currently has about $15 billion of assets under management as well.Loeb is known as an activist investor. He has reputation for taking positions in troubled or poor-performing companies and boosting their profits. Investors might be assuming that Loeb plans to take an activist approach with Colgate-Palmolive — and that he could even try to spin off Hill’s Pet Nutrition.Story continuesIt will likely take some time before any changes occur at Colgate-Palmolive. However, it’s interesting that an activist investor of Loeb’s stature has taken a position in CL stock. Judging by the initial movement of shares today, investors may see Loeb’s involvement as a positive development.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent earnings growth for Comcast has been in line with the market. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this modest earnings performance may begin to slide. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Comcast peKeen to find out how analysts think Comcast's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Comcast would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 14%. The latest three year period has also seen a 20% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.3% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's peculiar that Comcast's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.The Bottom Line On Comcast's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Comcast currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.Having said that, be aware  Comcast is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of Comcast's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

54,c9f85d7a-034a-370a-a547-69c2be316274,MU,2022-10-23,7 Semiconductor Stock Predictions for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-semiconductor-stock-predictions-2023-204216074.html,1666212136,STORY,"['LRCX', 'TXN', 'MU', 'TSM', 'INTC', 'AMAT', 'AMD']","[Semiconductors are used in virtually all of the most important emerging technologies. Data centers, gaming, and electric cars all require a substantial number of chips. In fact, electronic components make up nearly 40% of internal combustion vehicles. Additionally, semiconductor chips play a vital role in the electronic equipment such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones that we use every day.Thus, it’s not surprising to note that demand for chips surged in 2020 and 2021. That said, supply chain difficulties made it difficult to get the chips where they needed to be. This caused many chip stocks to move down from record highs in 2022.Now, with many manufacturers overestimating their need for chips, these semiconductor stocks have been hit hard. While some argue this has allowed chipmakers to focus on the next generation of chips that will be in high demand, this is still a sector with some risk. That said, as more attention is paid to bringing semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, 2023 may be the start of another semiconductor super cycle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, here are seven semiconductor predictions and supporting stocks for 2023.TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$63.68TXNTexas Instruments$151.98INTCIntel$25.98MUMicron Technology$52.87LRCXLam Research$328.64AMATApplied Materials$76.78TERTeradyne$72.63Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)image of TSM semiconductor office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIf you’re going to pick one semiconductor stock, you can’t do much better than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). This company is the largest pure play in the semiconductor foundry/manufacturing space. Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures semiconductors for other companies, notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as other chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).This gives investors in TSM stock diversification within the sector. But as far as semiconductor stock predictions go, I’ll just say that the stock will be at the forefront of the chip market, when it turns around. Accordingly, with the sector’s focus now shifting to next-generation chips, that turnaround could come sometime in 2023.Story continuesThat doesn’t make TSM stock an easy buy right now. It’s down 47% for the year. That’s more than double the drop in the S&amp;P 500 this year. But at a price-earnings ratio of just 14-times earnings and a dividend with a current yield of approximately 2.9%, Taiwan Semiconductor should have a place on your watch list as we head into 2023.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock is down 19% this year. The reason can be traced to the automotive sector.The company generates the bulk of its revenue from three primary sectors: automotive, industrial, and personal electronic. Although investors are most familiar with the company’s footprint in the personal electronic sector (i.e. the calculator company), it’s the automotive sector that gives it a real presence in the semiconductor space.As far as semiconductor stock predictions go, 2023 is likely to be the year when supply chains get untangled. That may lead to a glut on the market that will temporarily be a headwind for TXN stock. But with battery electric vehicles making up only 5% of the nation’s vehicles, the future addressable market will be huge.TXN stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 16.5-times which makes it slightly more expensive than the sector average. However, the company does pay a dividend that currently yields over 3%, and the company has increased it for the last 18 consecutive years.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIt’s one thing for the United States to say it wants to bring home semiconductor manufacturing. It’s another thing for companies to be open to doing business stateside. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trying to make that a reality, but the company’s $20 billion plant in Ohio won’t be open for business anytime in 2023.That isn’t preventing the company from attempting to spend money to make that growth happen. In February 2022, Intel paid over $5 billion for the Israeli semiconductor company, Tower Semiconductor. The company was widely criticized for overpaying for Tower.More recently, the company is raising more eyebrows by bringing Mobileye public during a bear market. Given the fact that Mobileye would likely be a highly sought-after stock once the market turns around, this acquisition is the latest to raise concerns about Intel’s balance sheet.However, with a price-earnings ratio of 5.5-times and a dividend yield that is over 5%, INTC stock looks to be falling into the “too cheap to ignore” category.Micron Technology (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has been one of the biggest losers in this sector in 2022. Currently, MU stock is down around 47% for the year. However, the company just announced it broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in its hometown of Boise, Idaho, the first new plant of its type built in the United States in the last 20 years.What might be concerning investors is that the company continues to spend heavily on capital expenditures. In its last fiscal year, Micron spent more than $12 billion, which represented 39% of its revenue. However, the company believes these investments will pay off in the future.That said, will investors believe it? One of my semiconductor stock predictions is that they will. In fact, with a price-earnings ratio of 7-times along with a consensus price target that suggests that the stock has a 36% upside, MU stock presents an intriguing buying opportunity for patient investors.Lam Research (LRCX)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is another picks-and-shovels play in the semiconductor industry. The company makes the equipment necessary to make semiconductor wafers. This puts it on the leading edge of the semiconductor supply chain. The company is a leader and pioneer in the dry etch process. This allows the company to remove material with high-tech equipment.Unsurprisingly, the company has been posting consistent year-over-year gains in both revenue and earnings. However, one of the most compelling reasons to own LRCX stock is that the company is based in the United States, and that makes it an easy winner as semiconductor companies look to shift to fabricating their chips within our borders.LRCX stock has an attractive valuation at around 10-times earnings, and the company pays a dividend yield over 2%.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a competitor of Lam Research. And the fact that I’m putting both companies on this list suggests that one of my semiconductor stock predictions is that U.S. companies will broadly benefit from export controls.In the short term, the company will likely suffer due to slowing demand as well as competition from China.  However, Applied Materials expects to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% over time.Additionally, as Alex Sirois wrote recently, investors can take advantage of the stock’s year-to-date drop which is positioning it as a value stock within the tech sector. Given the company pays a dividend that currently yields 1.4% yield with a payout of $1.04 on an annual basis, this is a stock with strong fundamentals right now.Teradyne (TER)Artificial Intelligence (AI),machine learning with data mining technology on virtual dachboard.Business team meeting. Photo professional investor working new start up project. Finance task. ATER stockSource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comThe last stock on this list is not a semiconductor stock at all. Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) manufactures testing equipment that is used for semiconductors. Teradyne is poised to benefit from the next generation of 3 nanometer semiconductor manufacturing technology.This is a stock that proves boring can be beautiful. As you look at the company’s revenue and earnings over any length of time, you just see a company that delivers consistent results. What’s more, over half of that revenue comes from semiconductor testing.This consistency is reflected in the fact that the stock has 98% institutional ownership. That means it’s included in a lot of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).That hasn’t stopped the stock from being down 55% in 2022. But the stock is trading at a price-earnings ratio of just over 15-times earnings and even pays a modest dividend that currently yields right around 0.6%.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

(NYSE:PLD) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 19% in the last quarter. On the other hand the returns over the last half decade have not been bad. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (55%) in that time, and is up 59%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 28% decline over the last twelve months.Since the stock has added US$2.6b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Prologis There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Prologis managed to grow its earnings per share at 10.0% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Prologis' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prologis the TSR over the last 5 years was 81%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Prologis shareholders are down 27% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 23%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Prologis  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Plenty of retail traders, sure, but also some big banks and even a firm led by the one and only Cathie Wood. This, along with a current deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a potential deal with Disney (NYSE:DIS), should make DKNG stock investors all the more confident in their positions.DraftKings, and the sports betting market generally, received a great deal of attention on Wall Street after the onset of Covid-19. Lately, however, it might feel as if investors have abandoned DraftKings altogether.Yet, there’s more support for DraftKings among big-money investors than you might think. Perhaps they’re willing to spin the wheel and wager their capital on a sports betting revival — and they surely know that DraftKings has at least one headline-grabbing deal on its books.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips5 Investors Betting Big on DKNG StockSure, plenty of small-scale traders are wagering on DraftKings’ future growth. However, you might be surprised to discover that some big spenders are also rolling the dice and putting their chips on DKNG stock. So, here’s a quick rundown of some top institutional investors as of June 29, 2022.Vanguard: a jaw-dropping 32.51 million DKNG shares, which represents 7.25% of the outstanding shares.ARK Investment Management: 25.28 million shares, meaning that Cathie Wood’s firm held 5.64% of the outstanding shares.BlackRock (NYSE:BLK): 14.73 million shares, or 3.28% of DraftKings’ outstanding shares.Capital Research Global Investors: an impressive stake of 13.37 million shares, which translates to 2.98% of the outstanding shares.T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW): 9 million DraftKings shares, or 2.01% of the outstanding shares.DraftKings Has One, And Maybe Even Two, Value-Added DealsIt’s encouraging to know that Wood, a respected investor, favored DKNG stock. Nevertheless, there are other reasons to consider an investment in DraftKings now. Among them is DraftKings’ current deal with Amazon, and a potential one with Disney-owned ESPN.Story continuesDraftKings has already established a multi-year collaboration with Amazon. The two companies intend to provide pregame content and betting offers “every Thursday throughout the NFL season,” and this should provide massive exposure for DraftKings.Meanwhile, DraftKings may soon collaborate with the almighty Disney — or at least, with Disney’s sports network, ESPN. Reportedly, sources say DraftKings and ESPN are “on the cusp of signing an exclusive partnership … that [would] have shows and perhaps odds integrated into game broadcasts.”Despite all of this, DKNG stock was recently beaten down to just $12 and change. Bear in mind that the stock’s 52-week high is $50.48.In other words, the selling looks overdone as DraftKings is currently working with an e-commerce giant.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Quickly Is United Parcel Service Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that United Parcel Service has managed to grow EPS by 32% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of United Parcel Service shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 8.8% to 14% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for United Parcel Service's future profits.Story continuesAre United Parcel Service Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$143b company like United Parcel Service. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$114m. This comes in at 0.08% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add United Parcel Service To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Parcel Service's strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals share price has climbed 100% in five years, easily topping the market return of 39% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 63%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 64% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 63% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Waste Management share price has climbed 94% in five years, easily topping the market return of 39% (ignoring dividends).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Waste Management In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Waste Management's TSR for the last 5 years was 113%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Waste Management returned a loss of 1.3% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 16% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$192k but in since the time of purchase.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricThe Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$72.82 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 75.54k shares worth US$5.7m. But insiders sold 1.44k shares worth US$107k. Overall, General Electric insiders were net buyers during the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$195m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About General Electric Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded General Electric shares in the last quarter.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-automatic-data-140032098.html,1666447232,STORY,['ADP'],"[How far off is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.1%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$130bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$130b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$68bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$105b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$233, the company appears about fair value at a 8.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Automatic Data Processing, we've put together three relevant items you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Automatic Data Processing has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does ADP's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Jon Moeller, sold US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$129). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Procter &amp; Gamble Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Procter &amp; Gamble. In total, insiders dumped US$26m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$212m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Procter &amp; Gamble shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Procter &amp; Gamble is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Procter &amp; Gamble.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NASDAQ:PEP) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-51-return-equity-pepsico-120301357.html,1666440181,STORY,['PEP'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:51% = US$9.8b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.51 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, PepsiCo has a superior ROE than the average (15%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for PepsiCo by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesPepsiCo's Debt And Its 51% ROEPepsiCo clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.05. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

73,b68a6dd2-bb42-3f2e-b1c9-1fd4c418e192,UNP,2022-10-23,Calculating The Fair Value Of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-union-pacific-120128171.html,1666526488,STORY,['UNP'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific Is Union Pacific Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.44bUS$6.81bUS$7.04bUS$7.24bUS$7.44bUS$7.62bUS$7.80bUS$7.97bUS$8.14bUS$8.31bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.21%Est @ 2.14%Est @ 2.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.5kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$168bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$168b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$85bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$137b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$191, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.078. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.
