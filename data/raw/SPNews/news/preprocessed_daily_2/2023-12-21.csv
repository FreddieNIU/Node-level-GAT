You should think about starting with Schwab 1000 Index (SNXFX). While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, we were able to examine other factors like performance, volatility, and cost.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""SNXFX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. The Schwab 1000 Index made its debut in April of 1991 and SNXFX has managed to accumulate roughly $12.66 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager."", 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 12.03%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 8.45%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SNXFX's standard deviation over the past three years is 17.64% compared to the category average of 17.84%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 19.47% compared to the category average of 18.87%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. SNXFX has a 5-year beta of 1.02, which means it is likely to be as volatile as the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. With a negative alpha of -0.56, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.', ""Right now, 78.82% of this mutual fund's holdings are stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $344.06 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:"", 'Technology', 'Finance', ""This fund's turnover is about 2%, so the fund managers are making fewer trades than comparable funds."", 'Expenses', 'As competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SNXFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.76%. So, SNXFX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.', 'Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', ""Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

That’s undermined efforts to keep technology away from Vladimir Putin’s military following the invasion of Ukraine.', 'Representatives for TI and Analog Devices said they didn’t sell the chips directly to the Hong Kong entities and both stopped doing business with Russia in 2022. Still, the companies’ semiconductors have continued to stream into the country, showing the challenges of keeping US technology out of Russian hands.', 'More than 200 businesses in Russia — two now sanctioned by the US — received 17,000 TI chips from January through May of this year, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of the data. The shipments had a total value of $25 million. Chips sent to the now-sanctioned Russian entities were handled by two Hong Kong companies that were sanctioned in October for supplying Russian military-linked companies, the data show.', 'The top Russian recipient of TI’s chips, receiving $3 million worth in the period, was vehicle electronics maker NPP Itelma, which was added to the US Treasury’s sanctions list targeting Russian military-linked companies in September. The second-largest, VMK, received $2.3 million worth of TI chips. It also was sanctioned in September, for being a supplier of electronic warfare systems to the Russian military.', 'In the case of TI, the ubiquity of its chips is a factor: It has the widest selection of products in the industry, offering components that go into everything from washing machines to rockets. The company’s semiconductors also don’t go obsolete as quickly as other electronics, letting them stay in circulation longer.', 'TI said it had no knowledge that its chips were sold onward to military-linked entities in the country.', '“TI strongly opposes our chips’ use in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Any shipments of TI products into Russia are illicit and unauthorized.” Also, because the company produces a high volume of chips that can last decades and be used for multiple types of electronics, it’s possible they could have been in inventory before sanctions against Russia were enacted, TI said.', 'Still, US companies could go further to stem the flow of products to Russia, said Jack Freed, an analyst at C4ADS. Abnormal volumes of trade — plus links to Russia at broker firms — should give chipmakers reason to be suspicious about how their products are being handled, he said. There’s a “need for companies to do more to understand their products’ end use,” Freed said.', 'The value of the TI chips sent to Russia was just a tiny fraction of its roughly $18 billion in annual sales. But the semiconductors are part of a flood coming into the country from Hong Kong, according to C4ADS, which shared the information with Bloomberg News and assisted in its analysis. The firm based the research on publicly available information including customs data.', 'Almost 61,000 shipments of US and European chips traveled that way to more than 500 Russian companies in the first half of this year, the C4ADS research found. They were valued at $528 million in total. By just the middle of 2023, the shipments had already surpassed the 2022 total of $400 million by 32%.', 'Over the past year, Hong Kong has become the largest trade transit country for chips going to Russia, exceeding China, C4ADS found. Other countries sent far less.', 'Analog Devices, based in Wilmington, Massachusetts, also showed the same pattern of having its chips sent to the two now-sanctioned Russian companies via the two Hong Kong trading firms. The number exceed 13,000 in the period examined.', '“Any post-sanctions shipment into these regions is a direct violation of our policy and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products,” the company said in a statement.', 'Intel Corp. was the largest manufacturer of chips that went to the wider array of Russian companies, but only one shipment of its semiconductors — sent in January and valued at less than $330 — went to a now-sanctioned Russian entity, VMK.', 'In a statement, Intel said that it “promptly suspended all shipments to customers in both Russia and Belarus following the outbreak of war.”', 'The company, based in Santa Clara, California, said it complies with sanctions and regulations in countries where it operates and requires customers and distributors to do the same. “Intel actively and diligently works to track and mitigate potential distributor issues and has zero tolerance for circumvention of its requirements,” it said.', 'The two Hong Kong companies that sent TI and ADI chips to Itelma and VMK — Win Key Ltd. and Tordan Industry Ltd. — sent a total of $62 million worth of chips to Russia during the period. Tordan, in its incorporation form and annual reports, lists as a corporate secretary a consulting firm that had a Russian national as its director, according to C4ADS. It also lists a Russian address and Russian and Chinese telephone numbers as its contacts, and uses the same postal address in an industrial tower in western Hong Kong Island as five other now-sanctioned Hong Kong trading companies, C4ADS said.', 'The company’s website advertises: “With the combination of a Hong Kong company and a Russian bank account, you can conduct business with any country in the world.”', 'Win Key couldn’t be reached through its website and has no listed number. There was no response to an email sent to Tordan via its corporate secretary and no answer at listed mobile numbers in China and Hong Kong.', 'It’s unclear how TI’s chips reached the Hong Kong businesses since the chipmakers say the products weren’t sold to them directly. Still, C4ADS researchers say that companies like TI should be more closely scrutinizing the flow of their products. Publicly available data on these intermediary firms present clear red flags, C4ADS’s Freed said.', 'TI said it spends significant time and money screening its customers. But it’s dealing with a complex network of brokers and resellers.', '“TI has a dedicated team that oversees our longstanding, robust global trade compliance program across all of our operations,” the company said.', 'Companies have been held legally liable for violating the sanctions when it could be proved that they knew where their products would end up. “The question is whether they can say they don’t have knowledge,” said Diana Friling, a New York-based sanctions and export controls lawyer.', 'Read More: Why Deepening China-Russia Ties Worry Democracies: QuickTake', 'That means there’s legal incentive not to know the end user of a product, said Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven. Even when companies are fined for violating trade rules, it’s a small penalty compared with how much they’d have to spend to do more extensive due diligence.', 'Still, US corporations should take on this work, in part to protect their own reputations, Schmidt said. “Companies have a moral obligation to know who their customer is,” he said.', 'Political changes in Hong Kong have also made it harder to enforce US trade rules, Schmidt said. Previously, the government was more friendly toward Western interests and worked with the US on trade enforcement, but with China tightening its control since 2019 that’s no longer the case, he said.', '“We would have seen much more enforcement under the old Hong Kong,” Schmidt said.', '--With assistance from Ian King.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'On The Businessweek Show: What Audiences Actually Want to Watch', 'Elon Musk Made 2023 All About Himself', '©2023 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Before the latest hike, it had increased its dividend by 21.7% to 28 cents per share in December 2022.', 'ServisFirst’s ability to sustain the hiked dividend depends on balance sheet strength and the payout ratio.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.07 billion as of the same date. The higher level of cash compared with the company’s obligations depicts a strong balance sheet position. Hence, its capital distributions seem sustainable even if the economic situation worsens.', ""We believe that such continuous hikes highlight the company's operational strength and commitment toward rewarding shareholders handsomely. Investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to bet their money on and solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for such investors.

Its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment is benefiting from strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals. The segment’s revenues rose 7.6% year over year in the first three months of fiscal 2024. High customer retention levels are boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 11.3% year over year in the first three months of fiscal 2024.Enhancement of Product Portfolio: The company’s focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, may drive its performance in the near term. Also, CTAS’ focus on operational executions and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in the first three months of fiscal 2024, the gross margin increased 120 basis points to 48.7% from the year-ago reported number.Rewards to Shareholders: CTAS continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments & share repurchases. In the first three months of fiscal 2024, the company paid dividends worth $117.6 million, up approximately 20.4% year over year. Cintas repurchased shares worth $73.3 million in the same period.

That's not a statement that comes from a statistical analysis, but from a view of what's going on at stores that cater to cost-conscious customers. Basically, it's a read from what consumers are doing with their actual dollars."", 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Burlington Stores (NYSE: BURL), Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST), and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) have all been performing well for basically the same reason -- consumers are trying to stretch their spending dollars.', ""What would a consumer do if they felt they needed to save money? The easy answer is to start shopping at stores that offer more for less, which is exactly what discount retailer Ross Stores does. In the third quarter, same-store sales rose 5%. That's a pretty strong number, but according to the company, the main driver of that growth was store traffic."", ""To put that another way, more customers decided to shop at Ross stores in the third quarter than in the same quarter a year ago. And at the same time, sales at some full-price retailers like the ones that Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI) owns have been weak. Overall, this luxury retailer's sales fell 8.6% year over year in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Sept. 30), with declines at all three of its brands -- Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo."", ""That's an interesting dichotomy. Expensive stores struggled while discount ones thrived. (Note that Capri is in the process of selling itself to Tapestry.)"", 'Ross Stores isn\'t alone. Burlington also had strong same-store sales, which were up 6%. But there was an interesting little twist here. Burlington specifically noted during its third-quarter earnings call that it was able to bring in higher-priced items from ""recognizable"" brands and, here\'s the important part: They sold quite well. That\'s essentially trade-down traffic as consumers try to buy what they know and like, but pay less for it.', 'TJX also witnessed this in its third-quarter results, with this retailer posting a same-store sales jump of 6%. And that uptick was, according to management, entirely driven by an increase in traffic. Although the company was a bit coy about where those new customers came from, it is highly likely that it was customers trading down from full-price stores.', ""There was also another little niggle in TJX's performance. The amount each customer bought was lower (called ticket size), so the story for TJX was more people but each of them spending just a little bit less than they did last year. That sounds a bit like more consumers are pulling in their spending."", 'Then there\'s Walmart, which is one of the largest retailers in the world and specifically known for its low prices. During the company\'s third-quarter earnings call, management noted that: ""Constant currency sales increased 4.4% or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels."" Same-store sales for Walmart in the U.S. market were up 4.9% with a 3.8% increase at Sam\'s Club.', ""But here's the more important takeaway. Walmart is not just pleased by the increased traffic it is seeing, but it expects the current trend to continue into the fourth quarter. And that's led management to increase its 2023 sales guidance by a full percentage point on the top and bottom end, taking it from 4% to 4.5% up to 5% to 5.5%. While all of this is good for Walmart, it suggests that consumers continue to pull back and that could be bad news for 2024."", 'Consumers vote with their feet (or really their wallets, but you get the idea). And right now consumers appear to be looking for bargains in an effort to stretch their hard-earned dollars. It is a clear statement that consumers are worried about the future.

You ordered it. A notification arrived on your phone, showing the package had arrived. But when you open your doors, the parcel is nowhere to be found.', ""If this has happened to you, then count yourself among the unlucky group of shoppers who fall victim to package thefts — or porch piracy, as it's commonly known."", 'Here’s what you should know about the issue, and what to do if it happens to you.', 'HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS PORCH PIRACY?', ""It's hard to tell. Most police departments don’t track package theft in its own category, which means there's a lack of national data."", ""The FBI’s figures do show burglary offenses and larceny-theft — a category that includes shoplifting, pickpocketing, and instances of package theft — have decreased overall in the last 20-plus years. But since both categories are broad and the agency doesn’t keep tabs on specific incidents of package thefts, it's challenging to know whether the problem is getting better or worse."", 'Some police departments have started to segregate reports of package theft into their own category, which does show some worrying signs. In Denver, Colorado, for example, there’s been more than 1,260 reported incidents of package thefts this year, up from roughly 750 four years ago.', 'Some industry surveys show it’s a headache for many online shoppers. A product research company called The Chamber of Commerce said it surveyed 1,250 U.S. consumers in October and found that 26% of them have been victims of package theft. The problem was roughly split between urban and suburban areas, it said, and only 18% of consumers who’ve had packages stolen reported it to police.', 'Another report, which used a variety of sources and was compiled by the bank Capitol One, showed 14% of Americans were victims of porch piracy last year. It said those thefts amounted to $29.2 billion in losses.', 'WHAT ARE COMPANIES DOING ABOUT IT?', 'Retailers and delivery companies are trying to combat the problem in a variety of ways.', 'UPS and FedEx, for example, allow customers to delay package deliveries if they’re not home or divert them to other pickup locations, either for free or with a fee.', 'This year, UPS also rolled out a feature called DeliveryDefense that uses AI to assess delivery risks and generate a “confidence score” for addresses where merchants need to ship packages. If the address has a low score, merchants can offer customers in-store collection or UPS pick-up points, which include CVS and Michaels stores as well as other local businesses. UPS spokesperson Jim Mayer said 350 retailers are using the service, but declined to provide examples.', 'Retailers like Amazon and Walmart also allow customers to track their orders and prepare for deliveries, or pick them up in stores.', 'Amazon, which has a limited physical footprint compared to Walmart, has lockers where packages can be picked up at third-party locations, as well as its subsidiary Whole Foods. The company also gives its Prime members the option to have packages placed inside secure locations like their garage by Amazon drivers.', 'In addition, retailers and brands are partnering with companies that offer shipping protections, and choosing to take on those expenses or offer it to consumers who want to pay for it.', 'One of these companies, Extend, noted that it works with 400 retailers, merchants and brands like Anne Klein and LensDirect, which sells contact lens and glasses. Rohan Shah, the founder of Extend, says high-end retailers who are focused on retaining customers are choosing to pay for warranties. But the majority are offering it to consumers as an add-on.', ""WHAT DO I DO IF I CAN'T FIND MY PACKAGES?"", 'Retailers say customers should check their order status and confirm whether a package was delivered. If the delivery was finalized, they say customers should ask other members of their household or their neighbors to see if someone else accepted the delivery.', 'If that doesn’t work, the best thing to do would be to reach out to the company from which you purchased the item.', 'Shah, from Extend, said retailers are often trying to determine if customers are telling the truth, and looking at things like the shopper’s prior history of reporting stolen packages to determine how they should respond. Some, he said, are asking customers to file police reports, which most people don’t want to do whether they’re lying or not.', ""“There are these points – what I like to call friction or ‘gotchas’ – where (retailers) will try to minimize customers filing these claims because they know it's going to cost them,” Shah said. “It's a bit of a headache for all parties involved.”"", 'Ben Stickle, a criminal justice professor at Middle Tennessee State University and a leading expert on the topic, said retailers are generally willing to replace stolen packages, which might be driven by a desire to maintain their brand reputation and customer loyalty.', 'Amazon encourages customers to contact customer service if they don’t have their package in hand within 30 days of expected delivery. Customers who ordered items from Amazon’s third-party sellers should contact those merchants, the company says on its website. Walmart also says customers should reach out to the company.', 'Target includes a clause on its site that says the risk of loss passes to the buyer after the company delivers an order to a carrier. Still, the company says on its site that customers who can’t find their deliveries can request a replacement or a refund online.', 'If retailers aren’t helping, Consumer Reports says customers should contact the shipping company. If the purchase was made with a credit card, it might also be worth checking the credit card company’s benefits to see if it includes insurance for lost or stolen items, they said. Homeowners or renters insurance might also help, it noted, but those policies usually have deductibles of $500 or more.', 'WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?', 'Stealing packages delivered by the U.S. Postal Service is a federal crime. But punishment for taking parcels delivered by private carriers, like UPS or Amazon, falls under state laws, which can differ.', 'A bill to expand federal penalties to packages delivered by private carriers was introduced in Congress last year by U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat from Minnesota. But the legislation hasn’t advanced.', 'Meanwhile, some states — including Texas, New Jersey and Michigan — have been changing their own laws in the past few years to impose more stringent penalties on porch piracy.']"

And for those shoppers, the loans may not offer a lower interest alternative to the 30% interest rates on the most expensive store credit cards.', ""But even users who aren't delinquent in their payments can quickly become overextended, raising the risk of spiraling costs, credit analysts warned."", 'Seattle-area construction foreman Robert Boyer learned the hard way.

Eligible shoppers can get hold of credible payment options in nationwide Walmart stores, its official website and app as well as across Walmart Vision and Auto Centers.', 'In addition to reaping the benefits of lesser waiting times at self-checkout systems, the latest addition provides an opportunity for consumers to engage in smooth monthly payments while purchasing electronics, apparel, toys and more from Walmart. The transparent nature of Affirm’s solutions enables customers to get a clear understanding of the total purchase cost at the time of checkout. It does not contain any hidden fees nor does it charge any penalties for missing out or being late on payments.', 'With the availability of such beneficial payment solutions, consumers will inevitably be encouraged to purchase more. Therefore, the recent partnership extension seems to be a time-opportune move in the promotion of the widespread adoption of Affirm’s financing products amid the ongoing holiday season.', 'Thus, AFRM aims to harness prospects in the Buy Now Pay Later (""BNPL"") market. The space continues to witness widespread popularity as consumers seek installment payment options owing to the financial relief of not having to pay the entire amount at the time of checkout. According to a recent Affirm research, 54% of Americans are keen for retailers to provide a BNPL option at checkout.', 'Moves similar to the latest one are expected to boost merchant network revenues of Affirm, which improved 29% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. This revenue component comprises merchant fees that it earns from merchant partners (or integrated merchants) in return for using the AFRM platform for processing transactions. More addition of merchant partners within Affirm’s network is expected to boost usage of the financing products suite as well.', 'Also, the idea of adding its solutions to the self-checkout kiosks of Walmart seems to be prudent, considering the promising growth exhibited by the global self-checkout systems market. The space is anticipated to witness a 10.8% CAGR over the 2023-2033 period, per Future Market Insights.

That means some industries, such as cybersecurity, may well outpace other tech segments.', ""Data confirms an attractive trajectory for cybersecurity. That implies potential upside for ETFs such as WCBR. For example, Gartner recently noted cybersecurity spending could top $215 billion in 2024. That's a 14.3% boost from this year’s expenditures."", '“The continuous adoption of cloud, continuous hybrid workforce, rapid emergence and use of generative AI (GenAI), and the evolving regulatory environment are forcing security and risk management (SRM) leaders to enhance their security and risk management spending,” said Shailendra Upadhyay, senior research principal at Gartner.', 'Safeguarding customer data and avoiding reputational risk are among the primary cybersecurity objectives for companies across a variety of industries. So spending on data privacy and cloud security is expected to surge next year. That would outpace broader cybersecurity spending growth.', '“Privacy remains a top organizational priority as regulations that impact the processing of personal data continue to emerge, including those related to the use of AI. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 75% of the world’s population will have its personal data covered by modern privacy regulations,” added the research firm.', 'Other growth areas for cybersecurity expenditures next year are expected to include consulting, IT outsourcing, implementation, and hardware support. Some WCBR holdings address cybersecurity in those niches. Bottom line: Cybersecurity spending isn’t optional, and preventative measures are usually more cost-effective than reactive measures.', '“In light of cyber risks increasing, cyberthreats proliferating and a changing operating environment, it is more critical than ever for organizations to build and optimize a cybersecurity program,” said Upadhyay. “It is the cornerstone of cybersecurity initiatives which help SRM leaders secure new environments, protect against the expanded attack surface, consume security capabilities in new ways and create better efficiencies through automation.”', 'For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Modern Alpha Channel.', 'POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM', 'SPY ETF Quote', 'VOO ETF Quote', 'QQQ ETF Quote', 'VTI ETF Quote', 'JNUG ETF Quote', 'Top 34 Gold ETFs ', 'Top 34 Oil ETFs ', 'Top 57 Financials ETFs ', 'Gold’s 2023 Performance and Looking Ahead to 2024', 'Early Wrap-Up of Key ETF Trends From 2023', 'READ: Wrapping Up 2023 and What’s Next at Exchange', 'Meet a Strategist: Main Management’s Kim Arthur Looks Ahead', 'Goldman Sachs and abrdn Optimistic on Muni Bonds in 2024', 'READ MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >']"

If you want to skip our discussion on the US housing market, you can go directly to the 5 Cities Where Home Prices Are Falling Now.', 'The US housing market is experiencing yet another turn as affordability is dampening demand for houses in the country. Data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) showed that home affordability is currently at the lowest level since 1985. It also revealed that during Q3 2023, the median house price in the US rose by 2.2% as compared to the same period last year. This occurred after Q2 of 2022 witnessed a 2.4% decline in the median price of homes on a yearly basis. Overall, home prices rose in 82% of the housing markets tracked by NAR, with 11% of the markets experiencing double-digit increases in prices during Q3 2023.', 'Homeowners’ and buyers’ woes have further deepened as mortgage rates climbed to the highest level in the last 23 years. The 30-year mortgage rate ranged from 6.81% to 7.1% during the third quarter of 2023. The rise in mortgage rates has resulted from moves by The Federal Reserve to reduce soaring inflation rates. The monthly mortgage payment for an average single-family home with a 20% down payment increased by 19.2% during this period as compared to Q3 2022. About 27% of a typical family’s monthly income is spent on mortgage payments due to such a high rate.\xa0 Therefore, with the current interest rate, a six-figure income is needed to afford mortgage payments in more than half the housing markets within the US.', 'The increase in housing prices has made the situation quite unfavorable for potential home buyers. However, home buyers don’t need to lose hope, as there are still a few metropolitan cities that actually experienced a decline in housing prices year-on-year (YoY) during the third quarter of 2023. The decline in prices does not indicate a real estate market crash in these cities but rather a period of slowdown. Most of these markets witnessed a boom during the pandemic and are now undergoing correction. This trend was witnessed in 38 housing markets throughout the US. Out of these, 25 have witnessed more than 1% decline in housing prices as compared to last year. Among the 10\xa0cities where home prices are falling\xa0the most are Honolulu and Austin.', 'Some of the biggest real estate companies operating in the US market include AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD). Here’s what Baron Funds said about Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“The shares of\xa0Prologis, Inc., the world’s largest industrial REIT, declined in the third quarter of 2023 along with most REITs. We are big fans of CEO Hamid Moghadam and Prologis’ management team, and we remain optimistic about the company’s long-term growth outlook.', 'Prologis owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is concentrated in major global trade markets and large population centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Prologis has an unmatched global platform, strong competitive advantages (scale, data, and technology), and attractive embedded growth prospects. The company is the only industrial REIT with an A credit rating.', 'We continue to believe the appreciation potential for Prologis shares remains compelling given that the company’s rents on its in-place leases are more than 65% below current market rents, thus providing a strong runway for growth in the next three to five years.”', 'Mobile homes in a manufactured home park.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have all crossed that threshold and delivered big returns to investors -- but they won't be the last. If you aren't paying attention, it's easy to miss out on the next crop of companies that have the potential to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. The following three stocks have the growth profiles, size, and competitive advantages that will likely propel them into this rarified club within the next decade."", 'Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) dominates the customer relationship management (CRM) software industry, dwarfing its closest competitors in market share. Salesforce has become a standard tool for professionals in customer-facing roles, and its product suite is a trusted resource to improve the efficiency and overall performance of sales te ms. The company has built a wide moat based on high switching costs and a network effect, solidifying its competitive position.', ""Salesforce is transitioning to a new era as it matures amid global macroeconomic weakness. The company's growth rate has been slowing, and it has shifted focus toward profitability by managing operating expenses. That's been a common theme among tech companies over the past year."", ""Salesforce has adeptly managed this shift by slashing its expense budgets. This has propelled adjusted operating margins over 30%, placing the cloud software provider firmly into profitability. Salesforce expects free cash flow to grow more than 30% this fiscal year. These results clearly demonstrate that this business can produce strong cash flows, making it a less speculative investment than in previous years during its high-growth, high-burn phase. It's still expanding at an impressive pace, and there's a chance that it could accelerate once again when economic conditions improve. Renewed spending sales and product development could catalyze future growth, especially if AI enhancements stimulate demand for the platform."", ""Salesforce's market cap is around $250 billion right now. It's trading at a very reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below 30 and a price-to-cash-flow ratio around 26. If its earnings continue to outpace sales growth, the valuation is reasonable enough for Salesforce's market cap to quadruple over the next decade."", 'Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has enjoyed decades as one of the leading providers of creative software. Customers use the suite of tools to create digital images, videos, graphics, and documents. The company has added additional functions over the years, such as marketing, publishing, and analytics, entrenching Adobe as the market leader for content creation software.', ""Adobe's 12% growth rate last year follows a similar trend to Salesforce. The company's growth is slowing, but it's still expanding at an impressive rate. Adobe successfully drove profit margins higher by controlling costs, and its earnings growth is outpacing revenue. The company is delivering close to 35% operating margin, and it's an excellent cash flow generator."", 'AI presents both potential threats and opportunities for Adobe. The company has invested heavily in AI capabilities for years, which have been weaved increasingly into its product suite to support digital creators in new ways. However, there are concerns that AI could change the competitive landscape and ultimately hurt demand for Adobe products. That creates uncertainty for investors, but it also prevents upside.', ""Adobe's market cap is around $275 billion, with a forward P/E ratio of 30. If the company's offering isn't deeply disrupted by the proliferation of AI, it's a strong candidate to surpass $1 trillion in market cap over the next few years."", ""ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) provides a popular IT workflow platform with excellent traction among large enterprise customers from all industries. It's become an integral part of operations and effective digital transformation for nearly 1,800 companies. Its product quality and deep penetration of its target market have secured ServiceNow's place at the table for years to come."", ""Recent results have been highly encouraging. ServiceNow reported 25% revenue growth last quarter, along with nearly $200 million in free cash flow. The company's profit growth is outpacing sales thanks to discipline on operating expense budgets and economies of scale. ServiceNow also boasts a 98% customer retention rate, which indicates high customer satisfaction and effective sales processes. These are the exact features that investors should identify in stocks with sustainable growth catalysts."", ""ServiceNow's forward P/E ratio is close to 60, so it's a bit more expensive than the other stocks covered above. Its high growth rate and cash flow generation command a premium, so it's no shock that the stock has pricier valuation ratios. Even with aggressive expectations to meet, ServiceNow's outlook creates the opportunity for its market cap to grow from $140 billion today. It has a longer way to go than Adobe or Salesforce, but a couple more years of strong execution should help it close that gap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Salesforce wasn't one of them.

Its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment is benefiting from strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals. The segment’s revenues rose 7.6% year over year in the first three months of fiscal 2024. High customer retention levels are boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 11.3% year over year in the first three months of fiscal 2024.Enhancement of Product Portfolio: The company’s focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, may drive its performance in the near term. Also, CTAS’ focus on operational executions and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in the first three months of fiscal 2024, the gross margin increased 120 basis points to 48.7% from the year-ago reported number.Rewards to Shareholders: CTAS continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments & share repurchases.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.1%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Ralph Lauren's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 53.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.5% over that duration. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record.', 'Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Ralph Lauren has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.', 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Ralph Lauren that investors should take into consideration.

Final steps include removing the overhead lines and poles in some cases, and then completing paving and other work to return the surrounding area to a condition as good as or better than before the construction.', 'In recent months, on average, PG&E energized about 20 miles of undergrounded line each week. In all, customers on circuits in 20 counties now benefit from underground powerlines, extending from Trinity and Shasta counties in the north to Fresno County in the south.', 'Multiple benefits from undergrounding', 'Investing in undergrounding in the highest fire-risk areas benefits all PG&E customers in several ways—from improved air and water quality resulting from fewer fires; protection of wildlands; and over the long run, lower costs to customers due to reduced maintenance and vegetation management costs.', ""Expanding PG&E's electric system underground in High Fire-Risk Areas (HFRAs) will not only help reduce wildfires caused by utility equipment, but also will improve reliability and reduce the need for safety-related power outages."", ""Go to www.pge.com/undergrounding\xa0to see PG&E's progress and learn more about this crucial safety program."", 'Note to media: B-roll is available upon request', 'About PG&EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$1.92b', 'US$2.13b', 'US$2.43b', 'US$2.62b', 'US$2.77b', 'US$2.90b', 'US$3.02b', 'US$3.12b', 'US$3.21b', 'US$3.30b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 5.69%', 'Est @ 4.65%', 'Est @ 3.92%', 'Est @ 3.41%', 'Est @ 3.05%', 'Est @ 2.80%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% ', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.7k', 'US$1.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Motorola Solutions as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.015. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. However, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+74.4% vs. +56.5%). The company is benefiting from substantial improvement in its booking trends. Growing demand for travel and solid momentum in booked room nights are driving growth in the gross bookings.Further, strong global leisure travel demand is a plus. Furthermore, solid momentum across merchant, advertising and other businesses is a major positive. Additionally, strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is acting as a tailwind. For 2023, the company expects more than 20% year-over-year growth in gross bookings.Additionally, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are a positive. However, weakness in agency bookings is a headwind. Further, intensifying competition remains a major concern.(You can read the full research report on Booking Holdings here >>>)Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (-25.0% vs. -15.8%). The company’s performance in 2023 was disappointing. Growth in Opdivo and its new product portfolio (primarily Opdualag, Reblozyl and Zeposia) is being offset by declining revenues due to generic competition for Revlimid and Eliquis (outside the United States).Nevertheless, the label expansion of Opdivo for first-line lung cancer, bladder cancer and gastric cancer continues to boost sales. The approval of drugs like Opdualag, Reblozyl, Breyanzi and Sotyktu diversifies its revenue base. The impending acquisition of Mirati Therapeutics will strengthen its oncology portfolio.However, the company now expects its current new-product portfolio to generate $10 billion in revenues by 2026, which was earlier anticipated by 2025.

The stock of tiny competitor Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS)\xa0is basically flat over that same span. Clearly, investors wouldn't have benefited any more from owning one or the other of these two stocks over the past year. But if you are a growth-oriented investor, the opportunity set looks like it could be very different here as you look out to the distant future."", 'Starbucks has grown into a global coffee powerhouse. It has more than 38,000 locations around the world. In the United States alone it has a bit over 16,300 stores, or just about 43% of its total. The company turned in a strong year in fiscal 2023, which ended in October.', ""To put some numbers on that, Starbucks' revenue rose 11%. Same-store sales, which tracks the performance of locations open for at least a year, were up 8%. That was driven by a mixture of price (5 percentage points) and traffic (3 percentage points). Globally, the company opened 816 stores in the fourth quarter and more than 2,300 for the year. Starbucks is still a growing business."", ""By comparison, Dutch Bros would be a rounding error. The restaurateur ended its fiscal third quarter with 794 stores. That's less than Starbucks opened in a single quarter. And all of Dutch Bros locations are domestic. But here's where things start to get a bit more interesting. Dutch Bros' top line grew 33.2% year over year in the third quarter. And while same-store sales only came in up 4%, that is influenced by the company's plan to open new locations near existing locations as it expands. Although this leads to customer cannibalization, Dutch Bros doesn't have a globally recognized name to rely on to attract new buyers. It is a trade-off of sorts that balances growth against the risk of trying to start a new location with zero brand awareness."", 'That said, growth is the big story here and one that will likely dictate which company you think is more attractive.', ""As noted, Starbucks opened more stores in a single quarter than Dutch Bros has in its entire chain. But the company is huge and has to open a lot of stores to move the needle. As it stands, the new stores it opened in fiscal 2023 only increased the total store count by about 6.5%. The U.S. business only grew its store count by roughly 3%. So all of that store growth really wasn't as notable as it may seem when you look at the absolute numbers. By comparison, tiny little Dutch Bros grew its store count by a massive 29% year over year in the third quarter. That helps to explain the huge jump in revenue the company achieved relative to Starbucks."", ""This isn't going to be a one-time event. A Goliath like Starbucks just can't grow as quickly as a tiny competitor like Dutch Bros. So if you are interested in a growth story, Dutch Bros will probably be more appealing to you. Only there's a notable trade-off you have to consider since opening stores is an expensive task. Dutch Bros is nowhere near as profitable as Starbucks. To put some numbers on that, Dutch Bros earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Starbucks earned $1.06 per share. While it is highly likely that Dutch Bros' earnings will be meager while it continues to build out its footprint, it is actually pretty impressive that it can grow so fast and turn a profit at the same time."", ""With that in mind, investors need to consider the valuation differences between Starbucks and Dutch Bros. If you use price-to-earnings, Dutch Bros' P/E of more than 700 seems outlandish. Starbucks' 26, while not exactly cheap, will seem far more reasonable. The problem is that, given the stage of growth in which Dutch Bros is in, earnings aren't really the prime focus."", ""Looking at the top line (sales) might be more productive, as that is what the smaller company is focused on growing. Here, Dutch Bros' price-to-sales ratio is 1.8 times, which happens to be notably lower than the roughly 3 times at which Starbucks trades. From this perspective, investors are paying much less per dollar of sales for the upstart with huge growth potential (if the size of Starbucks in any indication) than for the industry giant that simply isn't growing as fast."", ""This alone doesn't make Dutch Bros a better investment. Indeed, for conservative investors Starbucks could easily be seen as the better option. Sure, slower and steadier growth is the most likely outcome, relative to Dutch Bros, but if you don't like surprises, that will probably be a good outcome for you. However, if you are thinking in decades and believe that Dutch Bros' early success is going to lead to future success, then there's simply more growth potential at the smaller brand."", 'Every investment decision involves making trade-offs between risk and reward. This comparison is no different. Conservative investors will probably prefer industry heavyweight Starbucks given its still-growing business, strong brand recognition, and global footprint. Growth investors, however, might actually find the opportunity presented by a relatively tiny upstart like Dutch Bros extremely compelling. Add in the lower price-to-sales ratio, and it looks like Dutch Bros stock could even be viewed as a bargain, relatively speaking.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

The labor movement seems to be prepared to continue to march on into 2024, with Starbucks (SBUX) saying it wants to resume talks with unionized workers and Teamsters working at Anheuser-Busch (BUD) voting to authorize a strike. David Madland, Center for American Progress, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the labor movement for 2023 as well as take a look a head into 2024, and the lessons that can be learned from previous strikes.', 'Madland comments on the potential push to unionize workers at Tesla (TSLA) facilities: ""After the big agreement between the UAW and the Big Three, the President of the UAW said we\'re going to to now organize nonunion facilities and name checked Tesla. So I can imagine a big push by the UAW to organize Tesla and all the other nonunion plants because the big concern is the future of the auto workers in electric vehicles. They really need to ensure that those future jobs are unionized. The contracts they signed with the Big Three gave them a foothold in the electric vehicle industry, but now they really need to transition to the other competitors there. I expect a big push in 2024 to do so.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I think back to some decades long research that the Economic Policy Institute, that they've been doing ultimately that shows that when there is a unionization effort in that industry, workers tend to benefit as well. Would that be the same case if we were to see a unionization effort at Starbucks be successful? Would the rest of the food and beverage industry really have to take note and could we see wages increase there?"", ""DAVID MADLAND: Yes, that's pretty clear that when workers and unions bargain for better contracts, other employers in similar industries tend to raise their wages. We saw that most clearly with the UAW new contract where they had big gains of over 25%. And then the non-union auto industry from Nissan, Tesla, et cetera, all also raised their wages. Not quite as much as the unionized workers, but they saw double digit increases there."", ""So yes, I think we could also see other retail that there's unionizing efforts in other retail beyond Starbucks. There's Trader Joe's just to name one. So I could imagine significant spillover effects if Starbucks were to get a good contract."", 'BRAD SMITH: You mentioned the automotive industry there. So ultimately, we got to go there. Tesla, do they end 2024 unscathed without having union talks?', ""DAVID MADLAND: Well, after the agreement between the UAW and the big three, the president of the UAW said we're going to now organize non-union facilities and name checked Tesla. So I can imagine a big push by the UAW to organize Tesla and all the other non-union plants because the big concern is the future of the autoworkers is in electric vehicles. And so they really need to ensure that those future jobs are unionized. The contracts that they sign with the big three gave them a foothold in the electric vehicle industry, but now they really need to transition to the other competitors there. And I expect a big push in 2024 to do so."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: David, I'm also keeping a close watch on the looming strike over at Anheuser-Busch. Bud Light, of course, it's been a big year for them. The contract is now up on February 29 in 2024, of course."", ""What do you think that you could take away from the Teamster's recent agreement with UPS and look forward to this Bud Light looming contract? Any expectations that you have for this? Could we see it reached before that contract expires?"", ""DAVID MADLAND: Well, the Teamsters and the UPS deal, I think, you know, this was-- there was a threat of a strike for that and the Teamsters were very close to striking. And then they reached a deal at the last minute with the team-- the Teamsters and UPS. And that was a big increase in wages for workers, but they also got rid of a two-tier contract and had some protections against, sort of, invasive technology monitoring. I could imagine a similar scenario playing out there where there's a long record of pretty decent labor relations at both UPS and Anheuser-Busch. So while there might be concerns right now about a contract and escalating fights, there is a track record to rely on that they could fall back on and hopefully reach an agreement before there's a strike.""]"

Market bears were growing louder in 2023 despite a huge rally driven by AI boom and strong consumer sentiment. A recession that was awaited didn’t arrive and many believe 2024 would see continued optimism, if not new highs. JPMorgan in its 2024 market outlook report said that 2024 would be the “last leg” in a long road towards normalcy in financial markets. However, JPMorgan said that investors should keep a check on their expectations :', '“Analysts’ expectations show earnings growing by 11% next year, double the long-term average, while our models are estimating 5-6% growth. Dissecting the sources of earnings growth, margins could maintain stability, but revenues are likely to slow. On margins, pricing power is waning, but input costs and wages are decelerating. Interest costs remain high, but 49% of S&P 500 debt is fixed beyond 2030, with no more than 7% maturing in any calendar year until then. Many S&P 500 companies also maintain ample cash balances, which are earning meaningful interest. Therefore, interest costs as a share of profits are falling. However, disinflation, slowing economic growth and headwinds to \xa0the consumer are likely to constrain revenues. If the U.S. economy goes into recession, profit growth would likely contract, weighing on stocks. In addition, unusually low equity volatility in 2023 could be difficult to sustain in 2024. The VIX was at 16.8 on average this year, compared to 19.5 over the last 15 years, while interest rate volatility has been elevated to early pandemic levels since the Fed began raising rates.

We then narrowed down our list to stocks from growth sectors like technology and biotechnology. From this dataset we chose 17 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors:\xa055', 'Ecommerce company Coupang Inc (NYSE:CPNG)\xa0in November posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.05, missing estimates by $0.02. Revenue jumped about 21% year over year to $6.2 billion, beating estimates by $260 million.', 'Here is what\xa0Baron Global Advantage Fund\xa0has to say about Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Coupang\xa0is a leading Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It went public in March of 2021, and we have been investors in this Fund since the IPO. After spending half a day with management, touring the company’s fulfillment center, asking questions, and learning more about the reasons behind the remarkable success the company has achieved over the last 13 years, we decided we wanted to own it in this Fund as well. When we originally invested in Coupang, our thesis was constructed around the company’s wide product selection, low prices, and unrivaled convenience thanks to its investments in an end-to-end infrastructure that covers over 70% of Korea’s population, enabling over 99% of orders to be delivered within one day or less, rather than the industry norm of two to three days, driving customer satisfaction, which translates to higher customer retention rates and lifetime value. We thought that Coupang would continue to gain market share in the U.S. $500 billion-plus Korean retail market, while expanding its offerings into additional categories, expanding its ecosystem via a third-party marketplace, and continuing to invest in infrastructure density to further capture inefficiencies, enhancing the customer experience, and improving profit margins. The company has since outperformed our expectations, growing its market share to 25% (#1 in the industry), despite not being a first mover, while building an unrivaled user experience with 99.8% of products delivered the next day (with the majority of them by dawn) and becoming profitable significantly faster than we expected. Our biggest takeaway from the visit was that despite all of Coupang’s success, there is still a long runway of growth ahead. For example, while most of the facility we visited is operated with pickers going to shelves to pick up items for orders, there was one room in which\xa0shelves drove themselves to pickers\xa0on the back of autonomous robots, which\xa0increased\xa0picker\xa0productivity by 3x. Additionally, while Coupang has been striving to reduce its reliance on distributors, which enables them to expand margins while lowering prices for consumers, a significant opportunity remains for further reduction. Lastly, we got plenty of examples of out-of-the-box thinking (no pun intended) from the company’s singulation process (improves the picking process by reducing the constraint to search for items order by order), decreasing use of boxes (80% of shipments are now\xa0boxless), enabling grocery delivery without cold-chain logistics (thanks to end-to-end supplychain efficiency), or how Coupang is able to fill trucks so that each carries more than 2x the parcels a UPS or a FedEx truck can, despite being half the size. The 4% free-cash-flow yield, which is also negatively impacted by the significant reinvestments the company is making into its emerging offerings, also contributed to our decision to add to our Coupang position upon returning to New York.""', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors:\xa057', 'Bank of America recently published its “triple momentum” stocks screen which filters for stock based on earnings, price, and sentiment from the news.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Looking at Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.', ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Philip Morris International is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.29 = US$12b ÷ (US$63b - US$22b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 29%.

While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 50%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Philip Morris International's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 82% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward."", ""Like most companies, Philip Morris International does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of."", ""Philip Morris International is not the only stock earning high returns.

Market bears were growing louder in 2023 despite a huge rally driven by AI boom and strong consumer sentiment. A recession that was awaited didn’t arrive and many believe 2024 would see continued optimism, if not new highs. JPMorgan in its 2024 market outlook report said that 2024 would be the “last leg” in a long road towards normalcy in financial markets. However, JPMorgan said that investors should keep a check on their expectations :', '“Analysts’ expectations show earnings growing by 11% next year, double the long-term average, while our models are estimating 5-6% growth. Dissecting the sources of earnings growth, margins could maintain stability, but revenues are likely to slow. On margins, pricing power is waning, but input costs and wages are decelerating. Interest costs remain high, but 49% of S&P 500 debt is fixed beyond 2030, with no more than 7% maturing in any calendar year until then. Many S&P 500 companies also maintain ample cash balances, which are earning meaningful interest. Therefore, interest costs as a share of profits are falling. However, disinflation, slowing economic growth and headwinds to \xa0the consumer are likely to constrain revenues. If the U.S. economy goes into recession, profit growth would likely contract, weighing on stocks. In addition, unusually low equity volatility in 2023 could be difficult to sustain in 2024. The VIX was at 16.8 on average this year, compared to 19.5 over the last 15 years, while interest rate volatility has been elevated to early pandemic levels since the Fed began raising rates. If the U.S. economy falters, interest rate volatility could pass the baton to equities.”', 'Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashMethodology For this article we first used a stock screener to identify large-cap stocks with quarter-over-quarter sales growth of over 20% and over 5% sales growth recorded over the past five years. We then narrowed down our list to stocks from growth sectors like technology and biotechnology. From this dataset we chose 17 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors:\xa055', 'Ecommerce company Coupang Inc (NYSE:CPNG)\xa0in November posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.05, missing estimates by $0.02. Revenue jumped about 21% year over year to $6.2 billion, beating estimates by $260 million.', 'Here is what\xa0Baron Global Advantage Fund\xa0has to say about Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Coupang\xa0is a leading Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It went public in March of 2021, and we have been investors in this Fund since the IPO. After spending half a day with management, touring the company’s fulfillment center, asking questions, and learning more about the reasons behind the remarkable success the company has achieved over the last 13 years, we decided we wanted to own it in this Fund as well. When we originally invested in Coupang, our thesis was constructed around the company’s wide product selection, low prices, and unrivaled convenience thanks to its investments in an end-to-end infrastructure that covers over 70% of Korea’s population, enabling over 99% of orders to be delivered within one day or less, rather than the industry norm of two to three days, driving customer satisfaction, which translates to higher customer retention rates and lifetime value. We thought that Coupang would continue to gain market share in the U.S. $500 billion-plus Korean retail market, while expanding its offerings into additional categories, expanding its ecosystem via a third-party marketplace, and continuing to invest in infrastructure density to further capture inefficiencies, enhancing the customer experience, and improving profit margins. The company has since outperformed our expectations, growing its market share to 25% (#1 in the industry), despite not being a first mover, while building an unrivaled user experience with 99.8% of products delivered the next day (with the majority of them by dawn) and becoming profitable significantly faster than we expected. Our biggest takeaway from the visit was that despite all of Coupang’s success, there is still a long runway of growth ahead.

It's not much to look at on the surface. Check under the proverbial hood, however. This stock's revving a bigger dividend engine than many investors realize."", ""There was a time when Goldman Sachs was Wall Street royalty. But, that's not quite the case any longer. Its crown has lost some of its luster at the same time rival investment banks stepped up their games. The company was also heavily implicated in 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown, which still tarnishes its reputation. Its entry into new business lines in the meantime hasn't helped matters much."", ""The thing is, you own stocks for where the underlying companies are going -- not for where they've been. And where Goldman is going looks pretty compelling to income-minded investors."", ""Admittedly, not everyone wholeheartedly agrees. Although the stock's dividend yield of 2.9% is respectable, it's not exactly riveting. This is also the same Goldman Sachs on pace to report a 29% year-over-year dip in per-share earnings thanks to an 11% decline in revenue. The withering of the world's fundraising and underwriting business since then has clearly taken the wind out of one of Goldman Sachs' biggest sails, pinching off cash flow that helps fund dividend payments. Its other, related institutional businesses are running into headwinds too. And it hasn't gone unnoticed by the market. While well up from October's low, Goldman shares continue to trade nearly 10% below their 2021 high."", 'However, this is a case where income-minded investors would be wise to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The future here is far more promising than the recent past suggests.', 'To be clear, ""the recent past"" isn\'t just last year. Although 2023 is an anomaly, it\'s no more anomalous than the past few years have been. True long-term economic normalcy is within sight for the core of Goldman Sachs\' businesses, and, perhaps more importantly, the regrouped organization is finally ready to put its past fully in the past.', ""As to the latter, give a great deal of the credit to CEO David Solomon. Although his tenure as Goldman's top executive, which began back in 2018, prompted heated debate, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. He's implemented three major structural overhauls, the latest of which from 2022 folds the company's struggling consumer banking business into Goldman's wealth management arm. Solomon may finally have the company as streamlined as it needs to be, with dozens of now-former partners now also out of the way."", 'But perhaps the bigger impasse has been the environment itself.', ""While a lethargic economy and steep inflation are a headache for everyone, these factors have firmed up at a time that's particularly problematic for investment banks. Almost any company that needed funds raised those funds during the pandemic. Moreover, with interest rates now at multi-year highs, companies are in no particular hurry to take on more debt. That's why EY (formerly Ernst & Young) estimates this year's worldwide total number of IPOs is going to fall 8%, while total funds raised via capital markets is set to slide 33% below 2022's already-suppressed levels."", 'The coming year will likely by quite different, however. With a so-called ""soft landing"" looking more and more likely for the global economy, dealmaking and fundraising should pick up, if only because so many companies are running low on cash. Analytics firms ranging from BCG to PitchBook to Deloitte to PwC are saying as much.', ""Analysts believe Goldman's top line will grow to the tune of 10% in 2024, pushing per-share profits up to $31.63. That's still not back to 2021's stunning profitability levels. With the exception of that one year, though, that will be the biggest profit Goldman Sachs has turned in for a long, long time."", ""Great, but the yield is merely so-so at this time. Where's the gushing cash for shareholders?"", ""Don't worry. It's coming."", 'Investors will want to keep in mind this company has a solid history of dividend growth even in difficult circumstances. The current quarterly payment of $2.75 per share is more than twice its pre-pandemic payout of $1.25, and more than three times the per-share dividend of $0.80 being dished out as of 2018.', ""Better still, it can afford to make these payments even under the most challenging of scenarios. Goldman Sachs is on pace to earn more than twice what it's dishing out every quarter to shareholders in 2023, and this year is an off year! Assuming analysts' expectations for 2024 (and beyond) are on target, these dividend payments will only require about one-third of the investment bank's earnings. The rest can be put back into the business itself."", ""Bottom line? The past several years have been unusually tough for Goldman Sachs -- as well as its shareholders -- for several reasons. Most of those reasons are now rather far back in the rearview mirror, though. The company looks like it's finally getting back to its roots, one of which is being a healthy dividend payer with the added potential for above-average growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Goldman Sachs Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Goldman Sachs Group, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Goldman Sachs Group wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The West Texas Intermediate contract for January advanced by $2.11, or 3.04%, settling at $71.58 per barrel, while the Brent contract for February climbed $2.35, or 3.16%, settling at $76.61 per barrel.

Production cost is largely reserved for travel, equipment, and post-production editing. Furthermore, since documentaries tend to tap into incredibly niche markets, it is able to attract a loyal consumer base. Lower production costs and the increased potential for targeted appeal causes overall return-on-investment (ROI) to skyrocket exponentially. In this vein, streaming giants like Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have diverted significant investments in the production of documentaries and docuseries. According to an analysis by the New York Film Academy, the selection of Netflix documentaries and docuseries have increased exponentially over the last couple of years, with more than 90 documentaries on the streaming platform as of April 2023.\xa0', 'In its Q3 2024 earnings report, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported a massive decline in ad revenue weighing on its top line, despite earnings topping expectations due to profit at ESPN+ and the continued growth of its theme parks. Due to this, the company has made public its plan to ""aggressively manage"" its cost base, slashing total expenditure by an additional $2 billion in efforts to achieve a target of $7.5 billion in total cost cuts. Although the company\'s streaming business narrowed its losses year-over-year, total losses for 2023 have amounted to more than $400 million. In total, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has lost more than $10 million on its streaming service venture since it was launched in 2019. The platform bled more than 11.7 million subscribers globally in Q3 2023.', ""According to a report by The New York Times, the depreciation was exacerbated due to a low-priced version of Disney+ in the Indian market. In 2022, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) lost a bid to renew the lucrative rights of the Indian Premier League cricket matches, causing the platform to lose millions of subscribers. To make streaming a more profitable venture, the company's CEO Robert Iger has shifted focus away from a brisk subscriber growth model, in a bid to cut down on expensive marketing campaigns. Instead, the company is aiming to attain a higher value to its existing consumer base. In December 2022, the monthly price for access to an ad-free configuration of Disney+ rose to $11 from $8. The company doubled down on this strategy in October 2023 by increasing the price of Disney-run Hulu, with began charging $18 for ad-free access, up from $15. According to the CEO, the company intend to divert more subscription to the advertiser-supported tier to maximize revenue and rake in profits. This strategy, coupled with management's commitment to follow in the footsteps of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and crack down on password sharing caused The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) share price to appreciate by more than 2% in late November.\xa0"", 'However, since the company still relies on old-line channels like ESPN and ABC for more than 33% of its operating profits, these traditional channels raked in a quarterly operating income of roughly $1.9 billion in Q3 2023, down 23 percent year-over year. This is due to the fact that traditional TV outlets are being decimated by cord cutting, sports programming costs, and rampant advertiser pullback. You can read more on the current atmosphere of cord cutting and its impact on streaming companies in our coverage of 10 Best Live Streaming Services for Cord Cutters in 2023. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) attributed lower ad sales on its traditional TV segment to a decline in viewership and lower payments from ESPN subscribers, in addition to skyrocketing sports programming costs. To navigate around this predicament, the company\'s CEO has made it clear that he is looking for “strategic partners that could either help us with distribution or content"".\xa0', 'Evan Lorne / Shutterstock.com ', 'To compile our list of the 20 best serial killer documentaries on Netflix and other streaming services, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

Current outlooks project higher oil pricing through 2024. Though the forecast creates pain at the gas pump, it’s a boon to oil and gas stocks as higher prices help keep production high and cash flowing in a capital-intensive industry.', 'Of course, oil and gas stocks with dividends are primarily appealing to investors. Flush with cash during good times, mature oil and gas stocks usually have limited room to expand rapidly. So, instead of keeping earnings in-house for growth, great oil and gas stocks offer those excess earnings to investors as a dividend.', 'These oil and gas stocks combine the best of both worlds, offering growth opportunities while keeping income high through dividends.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com', 'Kimbell Royalty Partners (NYSE:KRP) is one of the top oil and gas stocks with dividends. Currently, it yields 11.64% and consistently hovers in the low-single digits. ', 'KRP took a beating in recent months as an earnings miss put downward pressure on share pricing. Still, the company’s position is solid and offers investors an upside as they reorient while keeping dividend income flowing.', 'Though the most recent quarter proved disappointing, KRP’s long-term prospects are appealing. Its 3-year average annual operating income growth rate is more than 100%, showing the firm has the financial chops to cut costs amid energy market volatility. And, though the company recently assumed more debt, its debt-to-equity ratio sits at just 0.31.', 'Likewise, shares appear oversold and materially undervalued. Its price-to-book ratio is just 1.06, which is low considering its growth record and renewed prospects.

This week, Buffet added to his position and bought an additional $590 million worth of stock after the firm announced an imminent acquisition of a private oil and gas company.', 'Occidental Petroleum stands out for embracing Buffett’s philosophy of value investing, coupled with a forward-thinking stance on environmental issues. The company is not only advancing in sustainable innovations but also maintaining robust operations, demonstrating resilience. It holds a substantial and enduring market share, particularly due to its strategic locations in key oil-producing regions of the U.S.', 'In line with Buffett’s ethos, OXY’s financials are solid and offer stability while accounting for growth. Its operating income growth is nearly 70% over the past five years. Plus, its debt is surprisingly low for an oil and gas stock. OXY’s current dividend yield sits at 5.5% but could climb after it closes the current acquisition and has cash to spare.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Like OXY, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is a favorite among institutional investors.

Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, holds a $1 billion stake in the company.', 'But Elliott Management intends to push for changes, decrying “Phillips 66’s performance [is due to having] shifted its focus away from its refining segment.” As the saying goes, “Follow the smart money.” And few indicators of smart money allocation are as strong as high institutional stakes. And, if Elliott Management’s outlook reigns true, investors could win big with this oil and gas stock.', 'Among other traits, institutional investors like PSX’s 9.5% dividend yield. But that isn’t all PSX offers investors. After a few choppy years, PSX’s net income grew more than 700% in 2022, largely on the heels of renewed cost-cutting and optimization initiatives.

That's not a statement that comes from a statistical analysis, but from a view of what's going on at stores that cater to cost-conscious customers. Basically, it's a read from what consumers are doing with their actual dollars."", 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Burlington Stores (NYSE: BURL), Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST), and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) have all been performing well for basically the same reason -- consumers are trying to stretch their spending dollars.', ""What would a consumer do if they felt they needed to save money? The easy answer is to start shopping at stores that offer more for less, which is exactly what discount retailer Ross Stores does. In the third quarter, same-store sales rose 5%. That's a pretty strong number, but according to the company, the main driver of that growth was store traffic."", ""To put that another way, more customers decided to shop at Ross stores in the third quarter than in the same quarter a year ago. And at the same time, sales at some full-price retailers like the ones that Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI) owns have been weak. Overall, this luxury retailer's sales fell 8.6% year over year in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Sept. 30), with declines at all three of its brands -- Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo."", ""That's an interesting dichotomy. Expensive stores struggled while discount ones thrived. (Note that Capri is in the process of selling itself to Tapestry.)"", 'Ross Stores isn\'t alone. Burlington also had strong same-store sales, which were up 6%. But there was an interesting little twist here. Burlington specifically noted during its third-quarter earnings call that it was able to bring in higher-priced items from ""recognizable"" brands and, here\'s the important part: They sold quite well. That\'s essentially trade-down traffic as consumers try to buy what they know and like, but pay less for it.', 'TJX also witnessed this in its third-quarter results, with this retailer posting a same-store sales jump of 6%. And that uptick was, according to management, entirely driven by an increase in traffic. Although the company was a bit coy about where those new customers came from, it is highly likely that it was customers trading down from full-price stores.', ""There was also another little niggle in TJX's performance. The amount each customer bought was lower (called ticket size), so the story for TJX was more people but each of them spending just a little bit less than they did last year. That sounds a bit like more consumers are pulling in their spending."", 'Then there\'s Walmart, which is one of the largest retailers in the world and specifically known for its low prices. During the company\'s third-quarter earnings call, management noted that: ""Constant currency sales increased 4.4% or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels."" Same-store sales for Walmart in the U.S. market were up 4.9% with a 3.8% increase at Sam\'s Club.', ""But here's the more important takeaway. Walmart is not just pleased by the increased traffic it is seeing, but it expects the current trend to continue into the fourth quarter. And that's led management to increase its 2023 sales guidance by a full percentage point on the top and bottom end, taking it from 4% to 4.5% up to 5% to 5.5%. While all of this is good for Walmart, it suggests that consumers continue to pull back and that could be bad news for 2024."", 'Consumers vote with their feet (or really their wallets, but you get the idea). And right now consumers appear to be looking for bargains in an effort to stretch their hard-earned dollars. It is a clear statement that consumers are worried about the future. As an investor, you might want to worry, too.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

A lot of numbers back this point of view. For example, the US economy grew nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2023.\xa0\xa0', 'This was the fastest growth pace for the economy in nearly two years. Higher wages from the tight labor market actually fueled a rise in consumer spending, forcing large businesses to restock to meet increasing demand.

Deep discounting helped the holiday season get off to a brisk start, per reports. The markets were further buoyed by indications of stable interest rates for the coming months.\xa0', 'Kathy Bostjancic, the chief of financial services firm Nationwide, told news agency Reuters that there was a chance that the central could achieve a soft landing. She noted that the resilience of the consumer provided credibility to the Fed achieving a soft landing, but should also be a signal to markets that the Fed was not likely to cut rates as quickly and as much as the markets now had priced in. Bostjancic added that the stronger economic activity remained, the slower inflation would decline, and the slower the Fed would respond with rate cuts.', 'Some of the risks that investors should continue to monitor heading into 2024 include inflation and elevated interest rates. Although inflation is on the decline, it reached a high of over 9% for the first time in four decades in the summer of 2022. As of November 2023, inflation numbers are around 3%. The decision of the central bank to raise interest rates to highs not seen in two decades was aggressive but appears to have paid off.

CAT has demonstrated its first battery electric prototype underground mining truck for Newmont Corporation NEM and other industry leaders. This marks a significant step in its journey to provide more sustainable offerings for the mining industry, both on the surface and underground.Caterpillar has worked on the prototype underground mining truck taking into account both customers’ needs and support from Newmont Corp. Caterpillar and Newmont had joined forces in 2021 to develop a fully connected, automated, zero carbon emitting, end-to-end mining system. The collaboration is expected to help in creating a safer and more productive mine, and also support Newmont in attaining its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.When paired with the commercially available R1700 XE battery electric loader, this battery electric truck will complete Caterpillar's first fully electric underground load and haul solution. This is a significant addition to CAT’s growing portfolio of battery electric and semi-autonomous technology for underground mining applications. The company had launched a 793-battery electric prototype surface mining truck in November 2022.With the help of technology and automation, miners are bringing radical changes to operations to increase productivity, reduce cost and improve frontline safety while cutting down on carbon emissions, which is the need of the hour considering the severity of climate change. To capitalize on this trend, Caterpillar is enhancing its autonomous capabilities and bringing innovative products into markets. These, in turn, provides Caterpillar with a competitive edge in mining. The company is working with other miners like Rio Tinto plc RIO and BHP Group BHP to achieve the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Rio Tinto’s most technologically advanced mine, Gudai-Darri, has 26 CAT 793F autonomous haul trucks, three CAT MD6310 and two MD6250 autonomous drills. The trucks implement real-time ore tracking using sensors to provide live dig face progression while data-informed modeling from the drills helps to build more accurate assessments of existing ground conditions and improve safety. The mine also boasts the first autonomous water carts, which are also developed by Caterpillar.In collaboration with Caterpillar, Rio Tinto is advancing the development of zero-emissions autonomous haul trucks. Once development is complete, it is anticipated that the world’s first operational deployment of Caterpillar 793 zero-emissions autonomous haul trucks will be at Gudai-Darri.BHP Group and Caterpillar are working together to replace the entire haul truck fleet at BHP’s Escondida mine, located in the Antofagasta Region of northern Chile.

That's simply too cheap to pass up for a dividend that's grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate since 2023."", ""The utility faced pressure from higher interest rates and the potential that some renewable energy projects won't be built economically, but in the long term this is one of the best utilities in the country, and a stock dividend investors will want to buy and forget about."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, NextEra Energy's biggest utility, Florida Power and Light (FPL), recorded $5.5 billion in revenue and net income of $1.18 billion. This is the core cash-generating business for the company. Other operations, like renewable energy owner NextEra Energy Resources, reported a loss of $230 million."", 'Utilities are steady businesses because they generate regulated returns on the assets deployed, and FPL has benefited from a growing population and growing consumption in Florida.', ""But the other parts of the business haven't been as steady."", 'NextEra Energy has two business units that are involved in renewable energy. NextEra Energy Resources develops and owns renewable energy assets and lives under the NextEra Energy umbrella, while NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) is a publicly traded entity controlled by NextEra Energy.', 'All of the development has been affected by higher rates, lowering the potential return of developing or owning renewable energy assets long-term. NextEra Energy Partners alone needs to refinance an additional $1.5 billion in debt after raising $750 million earlier this month with a 7.25% interest rate.', ""Higher rates pressure margins across the industry, but these assets still hold tremendous value, and NextEra Energy Partners still expects to have a dividend yield of over 11% exiting 2023. I think the market has underestimated the company's potential, and this will prove to be a great buying opportunity for investors."", ""Even now, NextEra Energy's management is confident in the company's growth trajectory. They said earnings are expected to grow between 6% and 8% through at least 2026, and dividend payouts will increase around 10% through next year."", 'The utility business will be a driver of the foundation of growth, but renewables will play a role. The company has proven its ability to finance at attractive rates and get into new technologies earlier than other competitors.', 'What investors in a utility like NextEra Energy need to look at is the long-term trajectory of the business and where the next decade of returns will come from. That matters more than the next few months.', ""NextEra Energy has tailwinds from a rising population in Florida and growing demand for renewable energy, which is more important than a few basis points of growth here or there.

But over shorter periods, the directional movements of the major indexes can be highly unpredictable.', 'Over the past four years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years. If this pattern were to persist in 2024, it would portend a difficult year for equities.', 'Thankfully, there is no shortage of safe stocks to consider buying. By ""safe,"" I\'m talking about profitable, time-tested businesses that can thrive in virtually any economic climate. And since most online brokerages have removed commission fees and minimum deposit requirements, any amount of money -- even $1,000 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work in tried-and-true companies.', ""If you have $1,000 to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies, the following five stocks stand out as the safest (and smartest) buys for 2024."", 'The first safe stock that makes for a no-brainer buy with $1,000 in the new year is payment processor Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which recently pushed to a new all-time high.', 'Although Mastercard is cyclical, it benefits from the disproportionate nature of the economic cycle. Whereas the 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have lasted between two and 18 months, the typical period of expansion over this timeline has endured multiple years. Extended periods of economic growth have allowed Mastercard to take advantage of higher consumer and enterprise spending.', ""Another factor working in Mastercard's favor is its purposeful avoidance of lending. While becoming a lender would allow Mastercard to generate interest and fee income along with merchant fees, it would also expose the company to potential loan losses and credit delinquencies during inevitable downturns. Mastercard has no direct liability to loan losses since it doesn't lend. This is the secret sauce that helps it bounce back from downturns quicker than other financial institutions."", ""Furthermore, Mastercard has a sizable opportunity domestically and abroad. It's cemented itself as the United States' No. 2 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume, and it has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Southeastern Asia, the Middle East, and Africa."", 'A second extremely safe stock that investors can scoop up in 2024 with $1,000 is the largest electric utility stock by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', ""One of the best aspects of utility stocks is the predictability of their operating cash flow. Homeowners and renters don't change their electricity consumption habits much from one year to the next. Additionally, electricity is a basic need if you own or rent a home. Regardless of what the U.S. economy throws consumers' way in 2024, NextEra can accurately forecast its operating cash flow."", ""What truly differentiates NextEra Energy from its peers is its renewable energy portfolio. NextEra had 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in operation, as of Sept. 30. Nearly half of this (34 GW) derived from renewables. No utility in the world is generating more capacity from solar or wind than NextEra Energy. This has helped reduce the company's electricity-generation costs and lifted its adjusted earnings growth to an annualized 9.8% since 2012."", ""To boot, NextEra Energy is a phenomenal value after a challenging year that saw Treasury yields soar. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 is the lowest it's been since 2015, and the company's yield is back to 3%."", ""The third top-notch safe stock you can confidently buy with $1,000 in 2024 is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Take note that I'm specifically talking about Berkshire's Class B shares (BRK.B) since a single Class A share ($551,182/share) will set you back more than the average house in America!"", ""The most obvious reason to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway is that you (sort of) get billionaire CEO Warren Buffett as your portfolio manager. Since taking the helm in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a 19.8% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (the Class B shares didn't debut until 1996). Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, a 58-year track record of doubling up the annualized total return of the S&P 500 suggests Buffett and his team know what they're doing."", ""Warren Buffett's love for passive income is a big reason for Berkshire's ongoing success. Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio is set to generate around $6 billion in dividend income over the next year. Companies that pay recurring dividends are typically profitable and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. More importantly, income stocks have substantially outperformed non-payers over extended periods."", 'The Oracle of Omaha is also a big believer in cyclical businesses. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett and his investing aides allow time to be their ally. Having a portfolio packed with cyclical companies allows Berkshire Hathaway to take full advantage of extended periods of growth.', 'Safe stocks exist beyond the megacap space. Small-cap water utility stock York Water (NASDAQ: YORW) is the perfect example of a surefire buy you can add to your portfolio with $1,000 for 2024.', 'York is a regulated utility that provides water and wastewater services to 54 municipalities in South-Central Pennsylvania. By ""regulated,"" I mean the company can\'t increase rates on its customers without first getting approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC).', ""While this might sound like a hassle, it's actually fantastic news. Regulated utilities avoid the prospect of potentially volatile and unpredictable wholesale pricing. As a result, York Water, like NextEra Energy, generates highly predictable operating cash flow."", ""It's worth noting that 2023 was a banner year for York. In January, the PPUC permitted the company to raise rates on approximately 75,000 of its customers. This rate increase will allow the company to recoup approximately $176 million in spending for system improvements and infrastructure replacements. It's expected to increase York's full-year revenue by about 22%."", 'Best of all, York Water is arguably ""Wall Street\'s Greatest Dividend Stock."" It\'s been paying a continuous dividend since its founding in 1816. The 207 straight years it\'s doled out a payout is 60 years longer than any other public company.', 'The fifth safe stock that makes for a smart buy in 2024 with $1,000 is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), commonly known as J&J. Johnson & Johnson has increased its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years.', ""The beauty of healthcare stocks is that they're highly defensive. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economies perform, people will continue to need prescription medicine, medical devices, and healthcare services. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, operating cash flow for healthcare companies tends to be highly predictable."", ""Johnson & Johnson's operating structure has certainly played a role in its success. It's been steadily shifting more of its revenue to pharmaceuticals for over a decade. Brand-name therapies afford J&J exceptional pricing power and are doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the company's operating margin."", ""Another reason investors can trust Johnson & Johnson is its first-class balance sheet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global, has bestowed with the highly coveted AAA-credit rating. S&P has the utmost confidence that Johnson & Johnson can service and repay its outstanding debt."", ""The cherry on the sundae for investors is that J&J's forward P/E ratio is at a decade low."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

With offices in more than 25 countries globally, Ratings holds an important position in the world\'s financial infrastructure. Ratings’ revenues are differentiated between transaction and non-transaction revenues.Market Intelligence (34%): It helps investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities to track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Desktop, Data Management Solutions and Risk Services are the business lines included in the segment.Commodity Insights (15%): Commodity Insights provides information and benchmark prices for commodity and energy markets. It helps producers, traders, energy and commodity market intermediaries with price data, analytics and industry insights, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in the market.Indices (12%): Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices mainly derives revenues from asset-linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and also from subscription and transaction revenues.Mobility (10%) & Engineering Solutions (3%) which were acquired as a result of the IHS Markit buyout, serves two different sections of customers.

We sourced data from multiple sources including The Washington Post, Delish, Pure Wow, Consumer Reports, and Bon Appetit. In order to find the hot dog brands most common across our sources, we calculated an average score represented as the ‘insider monkey score’. This score was found by dividing the sum of the respective rankings for a hot dog brand across all sources, divided by the number of sources across which it appeared. Since this was an average score, hot dog brands with a lower score tend to be more common across our sources. We have used average scores since most of the brands are owned by companies that operate other brands as well. Hence, using overall company revenue would not have been accurate for the representation of the firm’s hot dog business. However, we have enlisted recent sales figures for hot dog brands, those which were available.', 'Finally, we ranked the 15 highest-quality hot dogs in the US based on their calculated scores, using a consensus.

But over shorter periods, the directional movements of the major indexes can be highly unpredictable.', 'Over the past four years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years. If this pattern were to persist in 2024, it would portend a difficult year for equities.', 'Thankfully, there is no shortage of safe stocks to consider buying. By ""safe,"" I\'m talking about profitable, time-tested businesses that can thrive in virtually any economic climate. And since most online brokerages have removed commission fees and minimum deposit requirements, any amount of money -- even $1,000 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work in tried-and-true companies.', ""If you have $1,000 to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies, the following five stocks stand out as the safest (and smartest) buys for 2024."", 'The first safe stock that makes for a no-brainer buy with $1,000 in the new year is payment processor Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which recently pushed to a new all-time high.', 'Although Mastercard is cyclical, it benefits from the disproportionate nature of the economic cycle. Whereas the 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have lasted between two and 18 months, the typical period of expansion over this timeline has endured multiple years. Extended periods of economic growth have allowed Mastercard to take advantage of higher consumer and enterprise spending.', ""Another factor working in Mastercard's favor is its purposeful avoidance of lending. While becoming a lender would allow Mastercard to generate interest and fee income along with merchant fees, it would also expose the company to potential loan losses and credit delinquencies during inevitable downturns. Mastercard has no direct liability to loan losses since it doesn't lend. This is the secret sauce that helps it bounce back from downturns quicker than other financial institutions."", ""Furthermore, Mastercard has a sizable opportunity domestically and abroad. It's cemented itself as the United States' No. 2 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume, and it has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Southeastern Asia, the Middle East, and Africa."", 'A second extremely safe stock that investors can scoop up in 2024 with $1,000 is the largest electric utility stock by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', ""One of the best aspects of utility stocks is the predictability of their operating cash flow. Homeowners and renters don't change their electricity consumption habits much from one year to the next. Additionally, electricity is a basic need if you own or rent a home. Regardless of what the U.S. economy throws consumers' way in 2024, NextEra can accurately forecast its operating cash flow."", ""What truly differentiates NextEra Energy from its peers is its renewable energy portfolio. NextEra had 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in operation, as of Sept. 30. Nearly half of this (34 GW) derived from renewables. No utility in the world is generating more capacity from solar or wind than NextEra Energy. This has helped reduce the company's electricity-generation costs and lifted its adjusted earnings growth to an annualized 9.8% since 2012."", ""To boot, NextEra Energy is a phenomenal value after a challenging year that saw Treasury yields soar. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 is the lowest it's been since 2015, and the company's yield is back to 3%."", ""The third top-notch safe stock you can confidently buy with $1,000 in 2024 is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Take note that I'm specifically talking about Berkshire's Class B shares (BRK.B) since a single Class A share ($551,182/share) will set you back more than the average house in America!"", ""The most obvious reason to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway is that you (sort of) get billionaire CEO Warren Buffett as your portfolio manager. Since taking the helm in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a 19.8% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (the Class B shares didn't debut until 1996). Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, a 58-year track record of doubling up the annualized total return of the S&P 500 suggests Buffett and his team know what they're doing."", ""Warren Buffett's love for passive income is a big reason for Berkshire's ongoing success. Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio is set to generate around $6 billion in dividend income over the next year. Companies that pay recurring dividends are typically profitable and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. More importantly, income stocks have substantially outperformed non-payers over extended periods."", 'The Oracle of Omaha is also a big believer in cyclical businesses. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett and his investing aides allow time to be their ally. Having a portfolio packed with cyclical companies allows Berkshire Hathaway to take full advantage of extended periods of growth.', 'Safe stocks exist beyond the megacap space. Small-cap water utility stock York Water (NASDAQ: YORW) is the perfect example of a surefire buy you can add to your portfolio with $1,000 for 2024.', 'York is a regulated utility that provides water and wastewater services to 54 municipalities in South-Central Pennsylvania. By ""regulated,"" I mean the company can\'t increase rates on its customers without first getting approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC).', ""While this might sound like a hassle, it's actually fantastic news. Regulated utilities avoid the prospect of potentially volatile and unpredictable wholesale pricing. As a result, York Water, like NextEra Energy, generates highly predictable operating cash flow."", ""It's worth noting that 2023 was a banner year for York. In January, the PPUC permitted the company to raise rates on approximately 75,000 of its customers. This rate increase will allow the company to recoup approximately $176 million in spending for system improvements and infrastructure replacements. It's expected to increase York's full-year revenue by about 22%."", 'Best of all, York Water is arguably ""Wall Street\'s Greatest Dividend Stock."" It\'s been paying a continuous dividend since its founding in 1816. The 207 straight years it\'s doled out a payout is 60 years longer than any other public company.', 'The fifth safe stock that makes for a smart buy in 2024 with $1,000 is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), commonly known as J&J. Johnson & Johnson has increased its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years.', ""The beauty of healthcare stocks is that they're highly defensive. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economies perform, people will continue to need prescription medicine, medical devices, and healthcare services. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, operating cash flow for healthcare companies tends to be highly predictable."", ""Johnson & Johnson's operating structure has certainly played a role in its success. It's been steadily shifting more of its revenue to pharmaceuticals for over a decade. Brand-name therapies afford J&J exceptional pricing power and are doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the company's operating margin."", ""Another reason investors can trust Johnson & Johnson is its first-class balance sheet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global, has bestowed with the highly coveted AAA-credit rating. S&P has the utmost confidence that Johnson & Johnson can service and repay its outstanding debt."", ""The cherry on the sundae for investors is that J&J's forward P/E ratio is at a decade low."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

It’s not just going to be about new models and companies joining the AI arms race, though. Talk will increasingly focus on how companies are generating revenue from their early generative AI investments.', 'But AI won’t be the only story making waves.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry outlook in 2024, go directly and see 10 Best Backpacking Destinations Around the World.', 'According to a report by Deloitte, the seamless vaccine rollout and the global relaxation of pandemic travel restrictions led to a steady rebound in performance for the industry in 2023. Consumers, who had exhibited frustration from the sheer lack of leisure travel, created a wave of demand for hotels and airlines throughout 2021 and much of 2022. Although the return of travel businesses is still highly contingent upon the certainty surrounding public health, a major portion of the leisure travel consumer market have begun to take a step past pandemic concerns. However, there are other notable challenges which will determine the trajectory of the tourism market in 2024, ranging from consumer financial anxiety to concerns about the carbon footprint which goes hand-in-hand with leisure travel. Furthermore, the industry is currently in the midst of a massive shortage in the labor pool, a quandary which is impacting each and every segment of the industry. In such a precarious climate, many experts predict that the travel market is unlikely to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024, even in some of the best backpacking destinations around the world.', 'In order to navigate these new and complex realities, companies like Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) are reserving greater focus on product performance, price and enhancement of company fundamentals to ride off the current dip, which many have called a one-time-in-a-generation crisis. According to the Deloitte report, there are five primary trends which are likely to impact the growth of the travel industry in 2024, including a depreciation of demand, skyrocketing inflation, supply chain constraints and labor issues, the global sustainability imperative and the freedom to roam.

The metaverse is defined as a collective space where physical and digital worlds integrate to deliver immersive, interactive virtual- or augmented- reality user experiences, often referred to together as extended reality (XR). Speculations by consumers only grew when it was realized that underlying technology is already in existence and is proving increasingly cost-effective to use and implement by the day. Held up by aspirational advertising and virtual events, the estimated rewards for the travel industry in large is significant i.e. more than $20 billion by 2030. This technology has the potential to transform the way humans explore some of the best backpacking destinations around the world. Although the current user demographic trends remains young, it is absolutely critical for tourism companies like Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) to appeal to this substrata of the market.\xa0', 'However, despite initial agreement, there have been increased questions as to whether virtual travel can ever replicate tangible real-world experiences; for instance, can a virtual travel experience to the best backpacking destinations around the world ever mirror the real-world experience of backpacking alone?\xa0However, inspite of these initial trepidations, the XR ecosystem is manufacturing at pace. As creative formats break into the mainstream, the global world order has seen the emergence of a variety of economic models. The report predicts that the travel experience of the future will not be exclusively online or offline. Instead, travelers are much more likely to see a ramping up of hybrid options like virtual events edutainment, and profound inspiration combined with tangible experiences. Companies like Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) are beginning to maintain individual touchpoints rather than end-to-end offerings, and undergoing a more consistent move towards the metaverse. They seem to recognize the fact that the metaverse spells a $13 billion opportunity for tourism inspiration, largely catalyzed by digital travel advertising. Furthermore, with the pandemic affording massive traction to live streaming in terms of consumer demand, spending, and audience numbers, virtual events could account for more than 20 percent of tourism revenues through the metaverse. With the elite cadre of artists raking in more than $20 million per metaverse concert, the travel industry has anticipated an income potential of $800 million by 2025.

The industry accounts for more than 11% of the world's emissions and if no immediate action is taken in this regard, the number is well positioned to grow, considering travel is expected to soar by more than 85% from 2024 to 2030 in some of the best backpacking destinations around the world. Since carbon footprints are to be a major driver impacting decisions of the average consumer, employee, regulator, and investor going forward, companies like Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) have pledged to reach net zero. However, there are certain major obstacles which impede this transition, primarily stemming from the fact that decarbonization technologies in the market are fairly limited, and what is available tends to be incredibly inefficient in terms of cost.\xa0"", 'Although some organizations are considering demand reductions, a report by McKinsey highlights numerous alternative practical steps which travel companies can take to accelerate their transition to net zero and optimize the sustainability of their operations, whilst creating value for all stakeholders. The report highlights 4 high priority areas for travel companies like Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) to focus on, namely, the identification and sequencing of decarbonization initiatives, the curation of inter-organizational partnerships to accelerate decarbonization for business travel, incentivize leisure travelers to pay more for carbon-neutral travel options, and invest in research and development (R&D) initiatives to build a sustainable travel infrastructure for the future. For example, backpacking is a sustainable travel alternative. Hence, companies can incentivize backpacking packages to some of the best backpacking destinations around the world to substantially reduce their carbon footprint.

With increased investments in the metaverse and the inception of AI, the first examples of travel companies investing in and following through on green-business building initiatives have yielded favorable results, which should pave the way for other players in the industry to follow suit.\xa0', ""To compile our list of the 30 best backpacking destinations around the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 60 destinations which appeared most frequently during our research. Since determining the best backpacking location is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria; the criteria is premised on each destination's scenic beauty (20 points), backpacker-friendly infrastructure (15 points), and cultural richness (10 points). We then proceeded to award each destination a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 30 destinations which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the scenic beauty of the destination."", 'To sum it up, we ranked the 30 best backpacking destinations around the world based on their cumulative scores, using a consensus methodology.

However, due to timely interventions by the central bank, and considering the resilient nature of the US market, experts are now predicting that the worst may be behind the US and the economy is on a much better footing heading into the new year compared to last year. A lot of numbers back this point of view. For example, the US economy grew nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2023.\xa0\xa0', 'This was the fastest growth pace for the economy in nearly two years. Higher wages from the tight labor market actually fueled a rise in consumer spending, forcing large businesses to restock to meet increasing demand. Latest data from the US government indicates that retail sales registered a modest increase in November despite predictions of a slump. Deep discounting helped the holiday season get off to a brisk start, per reports. The markets were further buoyed by indications of stable interest rates for the coming months.\xa0', 'Kathy Bostjancic, the chief of financial services firm Nationwide, told news agency Reuters that there was a chance that the central could achieve a soft landing. She noted that the resilience of the consumer provided credibility to the Fed achieving a soft landing, but should also be a signal to markets that the Fed was not likely to cut rates as quickly and as much as the markets now had priced in. Bostjancic added that the stronger economic activity remained, the slower inflation would decline, and the slower the Fed would respond with rate cuts.', 'Some of the risks that investors should continue to monitor heading into 2024 include inflation and elevated interest rates. Although inflation is on the decline, it reached a high of over 9% for the first time in four decades in the summer of 2022. As of November 2023, inflation numbers are around 3%. The decision of the central bank to raise interest rates to highs not seen in two decades was aggressive but appears to have paid off. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates eleven times. This policy is now set to change from next year.\xa0', 'Investors eager to profit from the economic rebound should consider investing in companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). These firms have strong catalysts and long-term plans in place to achieve sustained growth. Glenn Fogel, the CEO of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), recently outlined some of these plans during the third quarter earnings call, commenting on how artificial intelligence would help the firm grow customers.\xa0', '“Given current trends, we expect customers and consumers will continue to prioritize travel over other discretionary spend in 2024. I firmly believe we are well positioned to continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform while making progress on several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term.

(NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Expedia Group, Inc.

This makes these spots ideal for adopting outdoor living throughout the year.', 'Investing in a vacation home is also deemed a good option due to multiple reasons. The idea of always having one’s own place to stay on vacation saves from the hassle of looking for hotels or vacation rentals that might be out of budget or simply unavailable at the required time.

Travelers who see themselves visiting a destination again and again can also purchase a vacation home so they can feel a part of the local community on their return. Vacation homes are a reasonable source of income as well. Vacasa’s Vacation Rental Buyer Report from 2022 reported that 55% of vacation home buyers purchase vacation homes as they want to generate income. 41% of the buyers invest in a vacation home to sell it later at a profit.

Regardless of what the U.S. economy throws consumers' way in 2024, NextEra can accurately forecast its operating cash flow."", ""What truly differentiates NextEra Energy from its peers is its renewable energy portfolio. NextEra had 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in operation, as of Sept. 30. Nearly half of this (34 GW) derived from renewables. No utility in the world is generating more capacity from solar or wind than NextEra Energy. This has helped reduce the company's electricity-generation costs and lifted its adjusted earnings growth to an annualized 9.8% since 2012."", ""To boot, NextEra Energy is a phenomenal value after a challenging year that saw Treasury yields soar. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 is the lowest it's been since 2015, and the company's yield is back to 3%."", ""The third top-notch safe stock you can confidently buy with $1,000 in 2024 is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Take note that I'm specifically talking about Berkshire's Class B shares (BRK.B) since a single Class A share ($551,182/share) will set you back more than the average house in America!"", ""The most obvious reason to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway is that you (sort of) get billionaire CEO Warren Buffett as your portfolio manager. Since taking the helm in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a 19.8% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (the Class B shares didn't debut until 1996). Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, a 58-year track record of doubling up the annualized total return of the S&P 500 suggests Buffett and his team know what they're doing."", ""Warren Buffett's love for passive income is a big reason for Berkshire's ongoing success. Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio is set to generate around $6 billion in dividend income over the next year. Companies that pay recurring dividends are typically profitable and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. More importantly, income stocks have substantially outperformed non-payers over extended periods."", 'The Oracle of Omaha is also a big believer in cyclical businesses. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett and his investing aides allow time to be their ally. Having a portfolio packed with cyclical companies allows Berkshire Hathaway to take full advantage of extended periods of growth.', 'Safe stocks exist beyond the megacap space.

Regulated utilities avoid the prospect of potentially volatile and unpredictable wholesale pricing. As a result, York Water, like NextEra Energy, generates highly predictable operating cash flow."", ""It's worth noting that 2023 was a banner year for York. In January, the PPUC permitted the company to raise rates on approximately 75,000 of its customers. This rate increase will allow the company to recoup approximately $176 million in spending for system improvements and infrastructure replacements.

Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economies perform, people will continue to need prescription medicine, medical devices, and healthcare services. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, operating cash flow for healthcare companies tends to be highly predictable."", ""Johnson & Johnson's operating structure has certainly played a role in its success. It's been steadily shifting more of its revenue to pharmaceuticals for over a decade. Brand-name therapies afford J&J exceptional pricing power and are doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the company's operating margin."", ""Another reason investors can trust Johnson & Johnson is its first-class balance sheet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global, has bestowed with the highly coveted AAA-credit rating.

By comparison, the economies of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada - G7 countries - have only grown by about 1.4% during this time.

You should always be on the lookout for companies that can deliver rising dividends year after year. These stocks help to cushion your portfolio when volatility arises, and also put more cash in your pocket as you await a market recovery. Indeed, the best dividend payers don’t just offer attractive yields today. These companies consistently grow those dividends over decades, allowing compounding to work its magic.', 'What’s extra appealing is that many dividend stocks achieve S&P 500-beating total returns over time with substantially better risk profiles than the overall market. These companies’ defensive business models make them much less volatile than the overall index.

Revenue growth is also expected to pick up to more than 5% by 2026.', 'Sure, these aren’t breathtaking growth rates. But for a $75 billion industrial company, high single-digit earnings growth is mighty solid. To me, this shows ITW still has the legs to continue outpacing its peers.', 'With its proprietary business model, structural cost savings and proven recession resilience, I believe ITW makes for a compelling core industrial holding today.

This makes Flower Foods one of the most stable stocks I’ve come across. However, FLO stock has broken its two-decade-long trajectory, since the pandemic scrambled things up.', 'However, this brief decline now looks like a temporary blip. Analysts forecast a quick earnings rebound in the company quarters as the company’s management team rights the ship.

Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) offers another solid choice. This trash and recycling giant holds a nearly identical profile: recession resilience, a strong market position, and double-digit forecasted earnings growth.

That’s all while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.', 'I view both WM and RSG stock as long-term winners in this defensive sector. Their growth trajectory over the next decade looks largely similar in terms of revenue and earnings.

If you want to double down on stability via the waste management sector, RSG stock should be on your shopping list.', 'While the recent passing of Charlie Munger initially spooked me on Berkshire (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), the stock has held surprisingly steady. Warren Buffett has prepared the company well for his eventual departure, with ample cash reserves, a diversified collection of “forever” stocks, and investing lieutenants in place to take over operations.', 'Even with Buffett still at the helm in his 90s, Berkshire remains a long-term winner in my book. The company has many levers to drive growth for years. These include a $157 billion cash pile for flexible investments, steadily-compounding stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), robust earnings from wholly owned subsidiaries, and its massive insurance float. Additionally, should crisis strike, Berkshire has prepared the mother of all rainy day funds. Buffett clearly sees the writing on the wall for a downturn, raising my conviction in this portfolio.

Walk the snacks aisle at any grocery store, and Pepsi’s dominance smacks you in the face. The company has effectively made its sugary treats a staple, etching itself into consumers’ daily lives. While discretionary by nature, Pepsi’s snacks and beverages generate dependable cash flows that hold up in a range of economic environments.', 'With PEP stock, you’re not just getting stability. You’re getting steadily-rising dividend income, too. This iconic company has achieved “Dividend King” status, now boasting 51 consecutive years of payout hikes. Yet, even as its business matures, Pepsi still delivers incremental growth, rewarding loyal shareholders with fatter dividend checks.', 'Trading at 22-times earnings, some call PEP stock expensive. However, I think investors need to pay up for exposure to unmatched scale, pricing power, cash generation, and brand loyalty that’s been built over decades. These factors allow PepsiCo to overcome inflationary pressures and economic fluctuations. Consumers may reduce some expenses when budgets tighten, but Pepsi’s snacks remain a fixture in weekly shopping carts, providing recession-resistant demand.', 'Source: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com', 'Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) rounds out this list, offering stability and modest growth.

While not the flashiest growth stock, I’ll take steady mid-to-high single-digit growth for a $23 billion staples giant.', 'Topping it off, CHD stock also provides investors with a safe 1.2% dividend yield which has grown over time. In fact, the company is another Dividend Aristocrat I think is worth considering. Trading at 29-times forward earnings, investors must pay a fair price for this quality stock.

And it pretty much sums up the different trajectories for CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) in 2023. CRISPR Therapeutics has enjoyed the thrill of victory, while Pfizer has experienced the agony of defeat.', 'But which of these two biopharmaceutical stocks is the better pick for a new bull market? Motley Fool contributors Adria Cimino and Keith Speights make the arguments for CRISPR Therapeutics and Pfizer, respectively.', 'Adria Cimino (CRISPR Therapeutics): CRISPR Therapeutics has advanced more than 50% this year, but this biotech stock may continue to climb -- especially in a market favoring growth. The gene-editing specialist just won U.S. regulatory approval for its very first product: Casgevy, a treatment for sickle cell disease. Regulators are set to decide on Casgevy for a second blood disorder, beta thalassemia, in March.', ""Investors anticipated this approval, thanks to promising clinical trial data, and you could argue that a regulatory nod was priced into the shares well before the decision. But that doesn't mean the opportunity for gains is over. That's because CRISPR Therapeutics' growth as a commercial-stage company is just getting started."", ""Casgevy sales will provide the biotech's first product revenue, and the therapy has the potential to become a blockbuster. Meanwhile, CRISPR Therapeutics is developing other candidates, using the same gene-editing technology."", 'By cutting DNA at a certain location and letting a natural repair process take over, the company edits the genome -- correcting faulty genes responsible for disease. As a result, the technology produces what could be functional cures for diseases, meaning each potential product could be a game changer both for patients and for the company. And the recent regulatory approval shows us that authorities are ready to vote in favor of this technology, another green light for CRISPR Therapeutics.', 'Casgevy sales and positive trial results from candidates both should offer CRISPR Therapeutics plenty of catalysts for share performance well into the future. And investors, looking for growth in a bull market, may flock to this company as its revenue increases and other potential products progress through the pipeline.', ""Considering all of this, CRISPR Therapeutics makes a top bull-market buy, and a stock you'll want to hold onto over time, as the company works to bring other exciting products to market."", ""Keith Speights (Pfizer): I can sum up the year for Pfizer in just three letters: U-G-H. The big drugmaker's sales, profits, and share price have declined sharply. The main culprit is the continued slump for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral drug Paxlovid."", ""Pfizer's guidance for 2024 didn't provide any reason to be encouraged about the near-term prospects for Comirnaty and Paxlovid. So why would this stock potentially be a smart pick for investors in a new bull market? I can think of three primary reasons."", ""First, Pfizer stock is now dirt cheap. Its forward earnings multiple is a super-low 9.8. There's no way to compare this valuation with CRISPR Therapeutics, by the way. CRISPR Therapeutics isn't profitable yet, while Pfizer raked in nearly $5.5 billion in profits during the first nine months of 2023."", 'Second, forward-looking investors should recognize that Pfizer is likely to return to solid revenue and earnings growth once sales for Comirnaty and Paxlovid bottom out. The company has multiple growth drivers, including its new vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Abrysvo, migraine drug Nurtec, and its Vyndaqel family of products for rare heart diseases. The acquisition of Seagen should also help fuel growth.', ""Third, Pfizer's share price doesn't have to move much higher for the stock to deliver market-beating total returns. That's because Pfizer's dividend yield currently stands at around 6%."", ""No, Pfizer won't generate sizzling growth anytime soon. But the stock just might be a better choice for a new bull market than many investors might think."", ""Which of these two stocks is the better buy in a new bull market will largely depend on your investing style. Income investors will obviously like Pfizer more since CRISPR Therapeutics doesn't pay a dividend. Value investors will also probably prefer Pfizer."", ""On the other hand, growth investors are more likely to choose CRISPR Therapeutics. With its first approved product on the market in 2024, look for the company's revenue to increase significantly."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Cold accounts for the most doctor visits than any other disease in the United States. Adults suffer from an average of two to four colds per year while young children get an average of six to eight colds per year. Some of the common cold symptoms include sneezing, a sore throat, congestion, cough, and a runny nose.', 'Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug can be used to relieve aches and pains. However, they should be taken depending on the patient’s health condition and age. For instance, Aspirin should not be given to children under 18 years old while asthmatic people should also not be given these medicines unless suggested by a doctor. Congestion, cough, and nasal discharge can be treated with a decongestant, antihistamine, or a combination of the two. Many over-the-counter products contain both of them. However, \xa0it is not suitable for everyone and should be consumed after consultation with a healthcare provider. As for antibiotics, they should only be consumed for treating bacterial complications that arise from colds.', 'Apart from prescriptions and over-the-counter medication, natural remedies tend to be effective against sore throat and cough. Herbs, minerals, and other products such as echinacea, eucalyptus, garlic, honey, lemon, menthol, zinc, and vitamin C are known remedies for a cold. While drinks containing alcohol or caffeine are consumed to fight cold, they can also lead to dehydration.', 'Companies offering over-the-counter cold medication include Pfizer Inc.

The company offers over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and supplements.

On December 15,\xa0 Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PADCEV, in combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This combination is the first approved to offer an alternative to platinum-containing chemotherapy, the traditional standard of care.', 'CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that operates the CVS Pharmacy and offers oral cough and cold products. On October 29, CNBC reported that the company decided to voluntarily remove some of the most common cough and cold medicines from its store shelves and will no longer sell them. These products contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient. This step was taken after a panel of advisors to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously determined that the main ingredient used in many famous over-the-counter cold and allergy medications, phenylephrine,\xa0 does not work to clear up congested noses when taken orally. However, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) will continue to sell other oral cough and cold products.', ""Kenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE), a consumer health company and a former Consumer Healthcare division of Johnson & Johnson, provides over-the-counter cold medications. The company offers cold, cough, and allergy-related medication through brands including Zyrtec, Benadryl, Sudafed, Benylin, Frenadol, Rhinocort, and Codral. On October 26, Kenvue Inc.

These sources include Business Insider, Medical News Today, Scoop Whoop, The Kitchn, and Food For Net. Moving on, we assigned a score to all of these drinks, as represented by the ‘Insider Monkey score’ in our list. This score is an average that we calculated by summing up the respective rankings for a drink across every source and dividing the sum by the number of sources in which the drink appeared in. Since this score reflects how commonly a drink appeared across our sources, a lower average score depicts a more commonly suggested drink suitable for a sore throat and cough.', 'Finally, we ranked the 15 best drinks for sore throats and coughs in descending order of their calculated average scores.', 'Insider Money Score: 7.0', 'Coffee with honey, which is a natural cough suppressant, is an effective cure for sore throat and cough. Honey also provides antibacterial properties. Hence, this coffee-honey mix eases coughing and ranks as one of the best drinks for sore throat and cough.', 'Insider Money Score: 6.3', 'Chamomile tea ranks among other best drinks for sore throat and cough. Chamomile works to lubricate the throat and soothes the scratchy irritation that comes from a throat infection. Chamomile tea is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. This can potentially help with tissue health and repair as well.', 'Insider Money Score: 6.0', 'The Penicillin is another alcoholic drink that includes ingredients such as honey, lemon, and ginger. Since the ingredients have soothing properties, the drink acts as an effective treatment in case of sore throat and cough.', 'Insider Money Score: 6.0', 'Hot blackcurrant drink ranks as one of the best drinks for sore throats and coughs. Blackcurrant is known for increasing salivation and reducing inflammation in the throat. The drink can be easily made by diluting a blackcurrant concentrate such as Ribena with hot water.', 'Insider Money Score: 5.0', 'Red wine hot chocolate is another warm drink to soothe a cold during winter. Hot chocolate mixed with red wine is known to have a rich taste and gives a warming effect to those suffering from sore throat and cough.', 'Insider Money Score: 5.0', 'The Dead Rabbit Irish coffee is another alcoholic drink deemed good for sore throat and cough. It is made by mixing whiskey with strong coffee and demerara syrup, topped with whipped cream. The drink has a rich and slightly sweet flavor.', 'Insider Money Score: 4.3', 'Ginger has been used to treat various ailments including sore throat. It is rich in antioxidants and reduces cell damage while preventing inflammation. Ginger is also known to promote immune responses to kill viruses. Hence, ginger is an effective way to cure a sore throat and improves the recovery time.', 'Insider Money Score: 4.0', 'Chai latte is made by mixing steamed milk with black tea that has been infused with spices. It is also a popular product on café menus. Chai tea which typically contains ginger, cardamon, cloves, and cinnamon, tends to soothe a sore throat and cough.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy on Robinhood for Beginners.\xa0', 'For a very long time, the United States stock market was the ultimate status symbol, with access to equity trading protected and policed by elite brokerage firms that charged hefty amounts to carry out trades. In recent years, with the advent of stock trading applications like Robinhood, owned by California-based Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), stock trading is no longer a game for the rich. It is now accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds through commission-free trades.\xa0', 'Robinhood has made a brand name for itself that will be hard to dislodge. For example, the company claims that nearly 80% of new accounts on the platform come from people who sign up themselves, unprompted by advertisements, or through customer referrals. This is quite astonishing given the hundreds of millions big corporations tend to spend on marketing budgets. There are also downsides to this brand power, as the platform is routinely accused of bias by both veteran and retail investors, depending on the market situation.\xa0', 'For example, veteran investors accuse Robinhood of gamification of stocks, while retail investors are unhappy when the platform restricts trading in the most volatile meme stocks. Robinhood has emerged victorious despite lawsuits and fines, and remains one of the most popular stock trading apps on the market. Since a majority of users on the platform are first time investors, it is not often easy to select the best stocks for investment. Investing is an art that takes a lot of time and practice to perfect.\xa0', 'Some of the best stocks to buy on Robinhood for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). A closer look at the business of these firms demonstrates their competitive edge. Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), recently underlined during the fourth quarter earnings call that the firm had succeeded in tripling adjusted earnings per share year-over-year by merely restructuring to ensure greater efficiencies.\xa0', ""“Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and the remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year. Q4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year. And all three of our businesses, entertainment, experiences, and sports, saw significant increases in fourth quarter operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal '22."", ""The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies, and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year. Our new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance their effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive, and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing, and programming. This has helped us improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023.

If you want to skip our take on how the gene editing industry sits right at the top of the global innovation food chain, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks. ', 'In the old days, alchemists were described as chemists who could turn lead into gold. A process undoubtedly perceived as magic, it offered dreamers a chance to untold riches by simply converting a low value metal into a high value asset. While modern day technology has still to convert anything into gold, it has also provided us with a slew of technologies that can comfortably lay the claim to being magical.', ""One such technology is the ability to manipulate genes. Genes are the 'software code' of the human body and they determine how tall we are, what color our eyes are, and when we'll start to lose our hair. At the same time, in a rather cruel demonstration of the human condition, they also determine if someone will get a deadly disease. Genetic disorders are some of the most debilitating diseases known to humans. Some examples of these diseases are Sickle Cell Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Brugada Syndrome. Among these, Sickle Cell Disease prevents patients, including children, from living their lives fully as their body cannot transport oxygen internally to lead to healthy functioning. People who suffer from Huntington's Disease target the human mind, making brain cells called neurons break down. If a sufficient number of neurons are significantly damaged, then patients, either children or adults, lose their ability to normally function."", ""Additionally, genetic diseases and their patients suffer from the additional complication of a lack of treatment options. Viral and bacterial infections such as the coronavirus or pneumonia can be treated by medicine that targets the invading pathogens. However, genetic diseases result from 'bugs' in the human body's software, so unless portions of this software are rewritten, the disease continues to wreak havoc. This re coding is at the heart of the genomic editing industry, and within its ambit is genetic engineering, a science that introduces new genetic material into the body."", ""This industry's potential also makes it quite lucrative. For instance, market research shows that the global genomics industry was worth $27.58 billion in 2021 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% until 2026 for a final value of $63.5 billion. If you're interested in knowing more about genomics, which is pure play gene editing, then you can check out 12 Best Genomics Stocks To Buy Now."", ""Shifting gears to see what's happening in the gene editing industry, the market is booming. In fact, December 2023 might be one of the most important months in the gene editing industry. This is because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two treatments for Sickle Cell Disease. These are developed through a partnership between Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) and by bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLUE). The Vertex+CRISPR treatment is the first of its kind that is developed through the CRISPR gene editing technology, and it marks a turn for the industry as it is one of the first genetic editing treatments that can be commercialized."", ""Of course, rewriting the human body's software is quite difficult. You can't use Python to do it, which makes such treatments among the costliest in the world. The Sickle Cell treatments from CRISPR+Vertex and bluebird cost an eye watering $2.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. While they are one time treatments, this price naturally will exclude most patients due to the high sticker price. Additionally, while they are cutting edge medical treatments, Sickle Cell medicine comes with its own side effects. According to the FDA, bluebird's treatment called Lyfgenia can cause blood cancer among patients - in a worrying example of from the frying pan into the fire."", 'So, as gene editing continues to make history, we decided to take a look at some of the most promising gene editing stocks according to analysts. Some notable picks are Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX).

On the income side, many blue chip dividend stocks sport higher yields than those of risk-free assets such as the 10-year Treasury bill, and their payouts also appear safe and dependable, as corporate cash positions are at near-record levels in many instances. Investors can also improve their long-term returns by reinvesting their distributions, giving the power of compound growth an added boost. According to a recent report by Hartford Funds, over the past 62 years, reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the total returns of the benchmark S&P 500 index.', 'Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) (aka BAT) are blue chip dividend stocks that command attention for two reasons. First off, both sport yields that are several times higher than the 1.5% average for S&P 500 stocks. They thus provide particularly generous income streams for shareholders. Second, both are known for their ability to generate ample free cash flow, which bodes well for the sustainability of their payouts and the prospects of future\xa0 distribution hikes.', 'But which of these blue chip dividend stocks is the better buy now?', ""Pfizer has the highest dividend yield of any big pharma stock -- 6.2% at the current share price. Its shares are also cheap, trading at 9.4 times 2024 estimated earnings. But due to falling demand for its COVID-19 products, Pfizer's revenue is on pace to decline by more than 40% this year, and it faces the prospect of little to no revenue growth next year, according to a recent corporate update. The drugmaker hopes to overcome this challenge by bringing new internally developed drugs to market and by acquiring biopharmas with commercial-stage assets, such as Seagen. However, these strategies will take time to pay off."", ""Still, Pfizer's dividend should be safe given the company's strong free cash flows and management's commitment to paying a top-tier cash distribution. However, the stock probably won't offer much in the way of capital appreciation until management's turnaround plan starts to bear fruit. That's fine if you plan to hold the stock for five to 10 years. But buying this big pharma stock if you have a shorter time horizon in mind for the investment may not be a winning strategy."", ""British American Tobacco is one of the largest tobacco companies in the world in terms of annual sales.

Its stock has reflected as much, skyrocketing 370% year to date and far outpacing the performances of other BNPL service provider."", ""That rise has been fueled by a combination of tamer inflation, a pair of better-than-expected quarterly reports, the aforementioned BNPL data from Adobe Analytics, and a slew of new and expanded partnerships in recent months with retail and e-commerce behemoths including Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Walmart."", ""This raises the question: Can Affirm possibly sustain this rise after the 2023 holiday season wanes? I think it's quite possible."", ""First, before their meteoric rebound this year, Affirm shares had been beaten down severely from their highs in part due to the company's relative lack of diversification.

Tentatively dubbed Affirm Plus, the service would guarantee a 0% interest rate for installment loans of as much as $2,500 for members who pay a monthly fee.', 'The market is growing quickly, with room for multiple winners as well.

A stock with a low price could actually be worth more than a stock with a much higher price."", ""This is great news if you don't have a lot of money to invest. You can find great picks that don't cost a lot of money. With this in mind, here are three no-brainer stocks to buy right now for less than $100."", 'There are actually two Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC) stocks. The limited partnership (LP) trades under the BEP ticker, while the corporate entity trades under the BEPC ticker. Both stocks have the same underlying business -- and both are priced below $30 per share.', 'The two Brookfield Renewable stocks have underperformed, compared to the broader market this year. Wall Street, though, thinks they have a lot of room to run. For example, the consensus 12-month price target for BEPC is nearly 19% above the current share price.', ""I think that Brookfield Renewable is an easy pick for long-term investors. The demand for renewable energy will almost certainly soar over the next decade and beyond as countries and major companies strive to hit their carbon reduction goals. Brookfield Renewable is poised to help meet this demand with a development pipeline that's more than 4.5x larger than its current operational capacity."", ""Income investors should especially like Brookfield Renewable. BEP's distribution yield tops 5.1%, while BEPC's yield is nearly 4.7%. The company has increased its distribution by a compound annual growth rate of 6% since 2012 and expects to continue growing the distribution between 5% and 9% annually."", ""2023 has been a horrible year for CVS Health (NYSE: CVS). The healthcare-giant's shares have fallen nearly 20%. But there's a lot to like about this beaten-down stock."", ""CVS is cheap in more ways than one. Its share price is around $75. More importantly, the stock trades at a bargain forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.8. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple is 21.5."", ""The company's business remains solid. CVS Health's revenue jumped 10.6% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 to $89.8 billion. The company posted a profit of nearly $2.3 billion -- a big improvement from the $3.4 billion loss recorded in the prior-year period."", ""As icing on the cake, CVS Health's dividend yield stands at close to 3.6%. The company recently announced an increase of 9.9% for its next dividend, payable on Feb. 1, 2024."", 'PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is another stock available for well under $100 that I think is a no-brainer pick right now. Sure, the stock appears to be on track to finish in negative territory for the third year in a row. However, that makes PayPal even more appealing.', ""The fintech stock trades at around 10.9x expected earnings. The valuation metric that I especially find intriguing, though, is PayPal's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.51. Any PEG ratio below 1 is considered attractive."", ""PayPal's business is also performing better than you might think after looking at its stock performance.

That's pretty depressing for shareholders."", ""It hasn't always been this way. PayPal stock was beating the market for a long time before it plunged over the past two years. Why is the market so down on PayPal now? And does this recent underperformance present an opportunity?"", 'PayPal is the leading digital payments company, with $1.5 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) over the trailing 12 months. TPV increased 15% year over year in the 2023 third quarter. It operates a double-sided business, counting TPV from merchant payments as well as peer-to-peer payments through PayPal and Venmo.', ""The pandemic became a big moment for PayPal as interest in e-commerce exploded, and that's PayPal's sweet spot. And yet, PayPal is more than just an e-commerce tool. It offers solutions for both online and offline merchants with payment processing tools and hardware."", ""It's not unusual that a company as large as PayPal reaches an inflection point at this stage. Its own growth is decelerating as it contemplates its path forward, and it hasn't maintained cost controls as it keeps getting bigger."", ""Not only has it grown to levels that make it more challenging to keep demonstrating increases, but it has spearheaded an industry that's drawing ever more competition. Alphabet's Google Pay and Apple's payment app are both becoming popular, and Block's Cash App and sellers business are both direct competitors to PayPal's services. Even Shopify, once known for its website-in-a-box business, now offers a full array of e-commerce solutions that are in PayPal's territory, and Shopify's service is growing much faster."", ""There's still plenty of opportunity. E-commerce is growing as a percentage of overall retail sales and is expected to reach 23% by 2027, according to Statista. That's an organic growth driver for PayPal's digital payments business."", 'One of its biggest growth drivers is Braintree, a white-label checkout service. Although PayPal is more well known for its small business merchant services, this is a service that targets larger enterprise businesses and includes clients such as Krispy Kreme and Snapfish.', ""New CEO Alex Chriss only took over about two months ago, but he gave some indications of where he sees the company moving. He mentioned unlocking PayPal's value as a platform, as well as leveraging its broad machine learning, artificial intelligence capabilities, and years of consumer behavior analytics to strengthen its business proposition. Along with that, it's going to invest in technology and automation to lower costs and become more efficient."", ""One area PayPal has pinpointed is active customers. Customer count reached a high of 435 million last year, and it has since declined to 428 million. Management has said it's redirecting its resources toward engaging active customers, and transactions per active account (TPA) are increasing."", 'PayPal stock is down 14% this year and is well off its highs. At the current price, it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 19, near all-time lows.', 'PayPal stock performance usually follows its net income, but that pattern has diverged recently.', 'That leads me to believe that it might be undervalued and that the stock price will rise to meet the real value of the stock.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price is up 44% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 13%."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' See our latest analysis for International Business Machines ', 'In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', ""During five years of share price growth, International Business Machines achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.5% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 8% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'We know that International Business Machines has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of International Business Machines, it has a TSR of 92% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""International Business Machines shareholders are up 18% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 14% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It’s not just going to be about new models and companies joining the AI arms race, though. Talk will increasingly focus on how companies are generating revenue from their early generative AI investments.', 'But AI won’t be the only story making waves. Augmented and virtual reality will also take center stage when Apple (AAPL) releases its Vision Pro headset in early 2024, setting up a showdown with rival Meta (META).', 'Autonomous vehicle technology will also get plenty of attention in 2024, as companies like Tesla (TSLA) and GM (GM) face criticism related to their self-driving capabilities and more automakers deploy advanced driver assistance features.', 'There are also sure to be stories that explode onto the scene that we can’t even fathom today.

All three companies have already introduced chips capable of on-board AI processing, and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel 8 Pro is running that company’s next-generation Gemini Nano generative AI model. And the number of devices running on-board generative AI will only expand from there.', 'Local generative AI apps will provide consumers with a greater sense of privacy and security, since the platforms won’t need to send user data to the cloud to do things like perform searches or organize information.', 'Apple could also jump on the generative AI bandwagon. During the company’s Q4 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook laid out how Apple already uses AI technologies across a number of its offerings including Live Voicemail and fall detection.

Here's why."", 'Cloud computing is complicated. So is artificial intelligence. For large enterprises and organizations with vast IT infrastructures and low risk tolerances, moving everything to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or tapping OpenAI may not be viable options.', ""IBM has positioned itself as a critical partner for enterprises looking to digitally transform and modernize their operations. The company's hybrid cloud platform can run anywhere, enabling clients to mix and match public clouds and their own private data centers. And watsonx, IBM's new enterprise AI platform, is tailor-made for enterprises that need to ensure their proprietary data remains safe and that they comply with regulatory requirements."", ""IBM expects to grow revenue by 3% to 5% this year, driven by strong demand for digital-transformation projects that deliver clear returns on investment for customers.

Generative AI was the story of 2023, and just because the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1, doesn’t mean it will become any less important.', 'Look for generative AI, and AI in general, to continue to drive a huge portion of the conversation in the year ahead. It’s not just going to be about new models and companies joining the AI arms race, though. Talk will increasingly focus on how companies are generating revenue from their early generative AI investments.', 'But AI won’t be the only story making waves. Augmented and virtual reality will also take center stage when Apple (AAPL) releases its Vision Pro headset in early 2024, setting up a showdown with rival Meta (META).', 'Autonomous vehicle technology will also get plenty of attention in 2024, as companies like Tesla (TSLA) and GM (GM) face criticism related to their self-driving capabilities and more automakers deploy advanced driver assistance features.', 'There are also sure to be stories that explode onto the scene that we can’t even fathom today. Who could have known in 2022 that generative AI would become the tech story of 2023? With that said, here are some of the biggest themes you can look forward to in 2024.', 'Generative AI stole the spotlight in 2023, and that will roll right into 2024 with an added twist: Those powerful AI capabilities will increasingly be available on your PCs and smartphones.', 'Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) are already talking up the so-called AI PC, or PCs with the ability to run generative AI apps. And we’ll see even more of them in 2024. All three companies have already introduced chips capable of on-board AI processing, and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel 8 Pro is running that company’s next-generation Gemini Nano generative AI model. And the number of devices running on-board generative AI will only expand from there.', 'Local generative AI apps will provide consumers with a greater sense of privacy and security, since the platforms won’t need to send user data to the cloud to do things like perform searches or organize information.', 'Apple could also jump on the generative AI bandwagon. During the company’s Q4 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook laid out how Apple already uses AI technologies across a number of its offerings including Live Voicemail and fall detection. Cook also specifically mentioned that Apple is investing in its own generative AI capabilities, and that could mean a smarter Siri.', ""“We will see more AI and Apple talking about generative AI built into Siri,” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “That's, from a consumer and a stock perspective, something that I think would be positive for Apple shares next year.”"", 'Investors, meanwhile, will be looking for returns on Big Tech’s AI investments from the prior year.', ""“They need to start driving incremental revenue,” explained Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud … my expectation is that you're going to have people actually buying and paying money for these incremental services.”"", 'Yes, AI will continue to drive headlines in 2024, but one other story might just rival the artificial intelligence bonanza: Apple’s Vision Pro headset. The augmented/virtual reality “spacial computer,” as Apple refers to it, will make its debut next year.', 'The $3,499 Vision Pro marks the first time Apple has entered a new product category since it debuted the Apple Watch in 2015. I was blown away when I tried an early version of the Vision Pro in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference. The technology felt as though it was worlds ahead of what rivals like Meta had to offer at the time.', 'Meta is the AR/VR headset market leader thanks to its Quest headsets and limited competition, but its Reality Labs division, which produces the Quest devices, loses billions of dollars each year.', 'If Apple is going to make the Vision Pro a hit, it will need to convince consumers that they need the headset, something Meta has struggled with.', ""“I think it's going to take five to eight years to gain traction, but I think [the Vision Pro] is going to ultimately be an exciting part of consumer tech,” said Munster."", 'Autonomous cars faced a number of setbacks in 2023 including GM suspending its Cruise self-driving taxi business after a vehicle dragged a person. Elon Musk’s Tesla, meanwhile, was forced to issue an over-the-air update to 2 million vehicles on the road in the US to address concerns that the company’s cars didn’t warn people about how to properly use its advanced driver assistance technology.', 'According to Moorhead, the automotive and tech industries underestimated how difficult it would be to get autonomous vehicles up and running at any scale.', 'But there’s still plenty of interest in the technology, and there will be no shortage of autonomous announcements throughout 2024 starting at the Consumer Electronic Show next month.', 'Nvidia, Qualcomm, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Toyota — they’re all working on advanced driver assistance technologies, which are a lead-in to self-driving vehicles.', 'Companies may, however, begin tempering expectations as to when full self-driving vehicles will eventually hit the road. Predictions that the technology is only a few years away are likely to be few and far between.', 'All of that said, if 2024 is anything like 2023, we’re in for another wild ride.', ""Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

I don't know if that's really going to work because the truck is very expensive, and it looks like it's not very profitable for them."", ""And it looks like they're going to take a while to ramp production. So I feel like they're not going to just be this natural. Plus, we've seen a lot of people in the truck market pull back on buying these trucks. When they started using them as real trucks, they didn't seem as attractive."", ""What I would say is Tesla's ace in the hole or ace in the PowerPoint maybe is the Supercharger network. That was a brilliant move for Elon to invest in that."", ""Now, we're seeing all the other car companies transition to the plug type that he's got in that Supercharger network. And he's starting to open it up to other companies and other cars. He could end up with quite the subscription model if he becomes the dominant player in the infrastructure and power supply field."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Karl, how do you think this recent recall for Tesla affects the brand's reputation?"", ""KARL BRAUER: You know, recalls are interesting. They cause a big, big news headlines when they first happen. And they're pretty much forgotten, sometimes between hours or days later."", ""This one particularly, it's going to be done mostly through over-the-air updates, while people are sleeping at night. It's a lot of cars. But it's also going to be pretty easy to roll out."", ""And there's been issues with his assisted driving technology undeniably.

The S&P 500 rose by nearly 23% this year after dropping by more than 19% in 2022. Still, this doesn't mean all stocks rose in unison."", ""But these three stocks have underperformed the overall market. Of course, that alone doesn't make them worthy of purchase. Let's uncover why I think these stocks will put a smile on your face for many holiday seasons to come."", 'Realty Income (NYSE: O) has severely underperformed the stock market this year. The shares have slipped 5.2% compared to a 24.9% gain for the S&P 500. Nonetheless, this real estate investment trust (REIT), which must pay out at least 90% of its taxable income as dividends, remains a strong choice for income-oriented investors.', 'Realty Income collects about 83% of its rent from retail tenants. That may cause some angst, given the threat from online shopping. But management carefully assesses the situation, renting to companies with a strong omnichannel presence or minimal online competition. These include grocery, dollar, convenience, drug, and home improvement stores.', ""Plus, the company's announced $9.3 billion purchase of Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE: SRC) will expand and diversify its real estate holdings."", 'Meanwhile, its existing portfolio has been performing well. Occupancy remains high, at 98.8% in the most recent quarter. And it was able to get a 6.9% boost on payments for expiring leases.', ""Realty Income, which pays dividends monthly, has raised them multiple times for more than 25 years. This includes the board of directors' recent decision to increase January's payment from $0.256 to $0.2565. The shares currently offer a 5.4% dividend yield, versus 1.5% for the S&P 500."", 'Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), founded nearly 20 years ago, gained popularity during the early days of the pandemic when many people stayed home. The stock exploded in 2020, rising by more than 300%. Since then, the shares have dropped by about 55%.', 'But the online marketplace, which connects makers of creative goods with buyers, has executed well this year. The Etsy site grew active buyers by 4% to 92 million. Gross merchandise sales were flat, but management largely attributed this to an overall economy that saw people affected by higher prices. Now that inflation has abated, I think this will improve.', ""During the quarter, Etsy's top line rose by 7% to $636.3 million. It's difficult to compare earnings, since the company took a $1 billion impairment charge a year ago. However, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased by 8.6% to $182.2 million."", 'The stock, with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.1, trades at a more attractive valuation. Earlier this year, the P/S multiple was about 8.', ""Target (NYSE: TGT) has made some missteps that included holding too much inventory in the discretionary merchandise category. Investors punished the retailer's stock, which has fallen by over 7% this year."", ""However, management has taken steps to address the issue, including discounting inventory to clear the shelves of unwanted items and stock up on everyday items. In its fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 28, inventory was 14% lower than last year. And while discretionary categories (like apparel and home furnishings) continue to struggle, Target's frequency categories (like beauty, household essentials, food, and beverage) have been doing well."", ""The better inventory position has led to an improved margin. Target's gross margin went from 24.7% to 27.4%, and its operating margin expanded by 1.3 percentage points to 5.2%."", ""Same-store sales have been under pressure this year, dropping by 4.9% in the quarter. However, I think that will improve, as a better economic environment will lead to higher discretionary spending. Target's stock sells at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18, compared to over 30 earlier this year."", 'These three stocks offer compelling opportunities. Realty Income should appeal to income investors. Etsy sells at a more reasonable valuation while continuing to grow its business.

Nvidia's overall sales of $18.1 billion were more than three times the $5.9 billion it reported a year ago."", 'Given its strong results, it may not be surprising that the stock itself more than tripled in value this year. The big question for investors, however, is whether this still is a good buy heading into 2024. At around 65 times earnings, the stock has an inflated valuation.', ""I believe next year may be a tougher one for the markets, and companies may scale back on their spending due to a potential recession, which could lead to a slowdown in Nvidia's customers ramping up their AI offerings. For that reason, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia's stock falls in value in 2024."", ""But as long as you're willing to hold on to the stock for the long haul, it can still make for a great investment. Analysts from Gartner project that the demand for AI chips could double by 2027.

Investors have become more bullish on the business amid a stronger ad market. But that too could come under pressure next year. While there is the hope that interest rates decline next year and there is a soft landing for the economy, the potential for a worse-than-expected recession could throw a wrench into Meta's growth. And while the company did achieve 23% revenue growth last quarter (period ended Sept. 30), that isn't typical for the business."", ""I'm not optimistic Meta can maintain this level of revenue growth. Meanwhile, its metaverse business, Reality Labs, continues to cost the company billions in earnings. While there's a lot of hype surrounding Meta's business this year, I think it may be approaching a peak."", ""At around 31 times earnings, this isn't a stock I'd consider buying for next year as its valuation is too pricey given that its surge in growth may not be sustainable, and there are still the losses relating to Reality Labs to worry about.

This is one of the stocks that I think could still do well in a potential downturn next year as cruises cater to an older, more affluent customer base, which could provide some much-needed resiliency for investors.', ""With oil prices also coming down, which should help improve profitability, and demand still looking strong, Royal Caribbean's stock could continue to be a great buy heading into next year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

That's not a statement that comes from a statistical analysis, but from a view of what's going on at stores that cater to cost-conscious customers. Basically, it's a read from what consumers are doing with their actual dollars."", 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Burlington Stores (NYSE: BURL), Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST), and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) have all been performing well for basically the same reason -- consumers are trying to stretch their spending dollars.', ""What would a consumer do if they felt they needed to save money? The easy answer is to start shopping at stores that offer more for less, which is exactly what discount retailer Ross Stores does. In the third quarter, same-store sales rose 5%. That's a pretty strong number, but according to the company, the main driver of that growth was store traffic."", ""To put that another way, more customers decided to shop at Ross stores in the third quarter than in the same quarter a year ago. And at the same time, sales at some full-price retailers like the ones that Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI) owns have been weak. Overall, this luxury retailer's sales fell 8.6% year over year in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Sept. 30), with declines at all three of its brands -- Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo."", ""That's an interesting dichotomy. Expensive stores struggled while discount ones thrived. (Note that Capri is in the process of selling itself to Tapestry.)"", 'Ross Stores isn\'t alone. Burlington also had strong same-store sales, which were up 6%. But there was an interesting little twist here. Burlington specifically noted during its third-quarter earnings call that it was able to bring in higher-priced items from ""recognizable"" brands and, here\'s the important part: They sold quite well. That\'s essentially trade-down traffic as consumers try to buy what they know and like, but pay less for it.', 'TJX also witnessed this in its third-quarter results, with this retailer posting a same-store sales jump of 6%. And that uptick was, according to management, entirely driven by an increase in traffic. Although the company was a bit coy about where those new customers came from, it is highly likely that it was customers trading down from full-price stores.', ""There was also another little niggle in TJX's performance. The amount each customer bought was lower (called ticket size), so the story for TJX was more people but each of them spending just a little bit less than they did last year. That sounds a bit like more consumers are pulling in their spending."", 'Then there\'s Walmart, which is one of the largest retailers in the world and specifically known for its low prices. During the company\'s third-quarter earnings call, management noted that: ""Constant currency sales increased 4.4% or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels."" Same-store sales for Walmart in the U.S. market were up 4.9% with a 3.8% increase at Sam\'s Club.', ""But here's the more important takeaway. Walmart is not just pleased by the increased traffic it is seeing, but it expects the current trend to continue into the fourth quarter. And that's led management to increase its 2023 sales guidance by a full percentage point on the top and bottom end, taking it from 4% to 4.5% up to 5% to 5.5%. While all of this is good for Walmart, it suggests that consumers continue to pull back and that could be bad news for 2024."", 'Consumers vote with their feet (or really their wallets, but you get the idea). And right now consumers appear to be looking for bargains in an effort to stretch their hard-earned dollars. It is a clear statement that consumers are worried about the future. As an investor, you might want to worry, too.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

That’s undermined efforts to keep technology away from Vladimir Putin’s military following the invasion of Ukraine.', 'Representatives for TI and Analog Devices said they didn’t sell the chips directly to the Hong Kong entities and both stopped doing business with Russia in 2022. Still, the companies’ semiconductors have continued to stream into the country, showing the challenges of keeping US technology out of Russian hands.', 'More than 200 businesses in Russia — two now sanctioned by the US — received 17,000 TI chips from January through May of this year, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of the data. The shipments had a total value of $25 million. Chips sent to the now-sanctioned Russian entities were handled by two Hong Kong companies that were sanctioned in October for supplying Russian military-linked companies, the data show.', 'The top Russian recipient of TI’s chips, receiving $3 million worth in the period, was vehicle electronics maker NPP Itelma, which was added to the US Treasury’s sanctions list targeting Russian military-linked companies in September. The second-largest, VMK, received $2.3 million worth of TI chips. It also was sanctioned in September, for being a supplier of electronic warfare systems to the Russian military.', 'In the case of TI, the ubiquity of its chips is a factor: It has the widest selection of products in the industry, offering components that go into everything from washing machines to rockets. The company’s semiconductors also don’t go obsolete as quickly as other electronics, letting them stay in circulation longer.', 'TI said it had no knowledge that its chips were sold onward to military-linked entities in the country.', '“TI strongly opposes our chips’ use in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Any shipments of TI products into Russia are illicit and unauthorized.” Also, because the company produces a high volume of chips that can last decades and be used for multiple types of electronics, it’s possible they could have been in inventory before sanctions against Russia were enacted, TI said.', 'Still, US companies could go further to stem the flow of products to Russia, said Jack Freed, an analyst at C4ADS. Abnormal volumes of trade — plus links to Russia at broker firms — should give chipmakers reason to be suspicious about how their products are being handled, he said. There’s a “need for companies to do more to understand their products’ end use,” Freed said.', 'The value of the TI chips sent to Russia was just a tiny fraction of its roughly $18 billion in annual sales. But the semiconductors are part of a flood coming into the country from Hong Kong, according to C4ADS, which shared the information with Bloomberg News and assisted in its analysis. The firm based the research on publicly available information including customs data.', 'Almost 61,000 shipments of US and European chips traveled that way to more than 500 Russian companies in the first half of this year, the C4ADS research found. They were valued at $528 million in total. By just the middle of 2023, the shipments had already surpassed the 2022 total of $400 million by 32%.', 'Over the past year, Hong Kong has become the largest trade transit country for chips going to Russia, exceeding China, C4ADS found. Other countries sent far less.', 'Analog Devices, based in Wilmington, Massachusetts, also showed the same pattern of having its chips sent to the two now-sanctioned Russian companies via the two Hong Kong trading firms. The number exceed 13,000 in the period examined.', '“Any post-sanctions shipment into these regions is a direct violation of our policy and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products,” the company said in a statement.', 'Intel Corp. was the largest manufacturer of chips that went to the wider array of Russian companies, but only one shipment of its semiconductors — sent in January and valued at less than $330 — went to a now-sanctioned Russian entity, VMK.', 'In a statement, Intel said that it “promptly suspended all shipments to customers in both Russia and Belarus following the outbreak of war.”', 'The company, based in Santa Clara, California, said it complies with sanctions and regulations in countries where it operates and requires customers and distributors to do the same. “Intel actively and diligently works to track and mitigate potential distributor issues and has zero tolerance for circumvention of its requirements,” it said.', 'The two Hong Kong companies that sent TI and ADI chips to Itelma and VMK — Win Key Ltd. and Tordan Industry Ltd. — sent a total of $62 million worth of chips to Russia during the period. Tordan, in its incorporation form and annual reports, lists as a corporate secretary a consulting firm that had a Russian national as its director, according to C4ADS. It also lists a Russian address and Russian and Chinese telephone numbers as its contacts, and uses the same postal address in an industrial tower in western Hong Kong Island as five other now-sanctioned Hong Kong trading companies, C4ADS said.', 'The company’s website advertises: “With the combination of a Hong Kong company and a Russian bank account, you can conduct business with any country in the world.”', 'Win Key couldn’t be reached through its website and has no listed number. There was no response to an email sent to Tordan via its corporate secretary and no answer at listed mobile numbers in China and Hong Kong.', 'It’s unclear how TI’s chips reached the Hong Kong businesses since the chipmakers say the products weren’t sold to them directly. Still, C4ADS researchers say that companies like TI should be more closely scrutinizing the flow of their products. Publicly available data on these intermediary firms present clear red flags, C4ADS’s Freed said.', 'TI said it spends significant time and money screening its customers. But it’s dealing with a complex network of brokers and resellers.', '“TI has a dedicated team that oversees our longstanding, robust global trade compliance program across all of our operations,” the company said.', 'Companies have been held legally liable for violating the sanctions when it could be proved that they knew where their products would end up. “The question is whether they can say they don’t have knowledge,” said Diana Friling, a New York-based sanctions and export controls lawyer.', 'Read More: Why Deepening China-Russia Ties Worry Democracies: QuickTake', 'That means there’s legal incentive not to know the end user of a product, said Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven. Even when companies are fined for violating trade rules, it’s a small penalty compared with how much they’d have to spend to do more extensive due diligence.', 'Still, US corporations should take on this work, in part to protect their own reputations, Schmidt said. “Companies have a moral obligation to know who their customer is,” he said.', 'Political changes in Hong Kong have also made it harder to enforce US trade rules, Schmidt said. Previously, the government was more friendly toward Western interests and worked with the US on trade enforcement, but with China tightening its control since 2019 that’s no longer the case, he said.', '“We would have seen much more enforcement under the old Hong Kong,” Schmidt said.', '--With assistance from Ian King.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'On The Businessweek Show: What Audiences Actually Want to Watch', 'Elon Musk Made 2023 All About Himself', '©2023 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Chile\'s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate on Tuesday to settle at 8.25%, delivering a cut that was larger than the 50 basis points estimated in a poll last week by traders. The peso fell 0.7%, while the S&P Ipsa stock index rose 0.4%. ""In our assessment, guidance from the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) turned notably dovish,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. Following the policy decision, the Chilean central bank said on Wednesday that the country\'s gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to end 2023 with no growth when compared to the prior year. MSCI\'s index tracking regional stocks dropped 0.6%, while a basket of regional currencies fell 0.3% against the dollar by 1525 GMT. The broader stocks and currencies index took a breather, after hitting multi-month and multi-year highs in the previous session as the Fed-fueled rally cooled a bit. The Brazilian real edged down 0.2% and stocks ticked 0.2% higher, recording fresh all-time highs, while the country\'s economic activity was worse than expected in October, corroborating broad readings of economic cooling. Markets will be focusing on key inflation readings of Latin America\'s largest economy due on Thursday. Ratings agency S&P Global Ratings upgraded Brazil\'s long-term ratings to ""BB"" from ""BB-"" on Tuesday following the approval of a landmark tax reform, positioning Latin America\'s largest economy just two steps from an investment-grade rating on the S&P scale. ""The stable outlook reflects the expectation that Brazil will make slow progress in addressing fiscal imbalances and still weak economic prospects, balanced by a strong external position and monetary policy that is helping to re-anchor inflation expectations,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. Mexico\'s peso edged up 0.2%, but stocks were down 0.2% after data showed domestic retail sales rose more than expected in October. Colombia\'s peso climbed 0.4% and the benchmark Colcap index nudged up 0.3% after the South American country\'s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 13% on Thursday, marking its first cut in more than three years.

They're usually time-tested, as well, which makes income stocks the perfect place for investors to put their money to work during periods of volatility."", 'But what makes dividend stocks so special is their continued outperformance over long periods. In 2013, a report from the wealth management division of JPMorgan Chase found that companies initiating and growing their payouts have delivered an annualized return of 9.5% over 40 years (1972-2012). Meanwhile, non-paying public companies trudged their way to a meager 1.6% annualized return over the same four-decade span.', ""In a perfect world, income seekers are netting high-octane yields with virtually no risk. In reality, studies have shown that risk and yield tend to correlate once high-yield status (4% and above) is reached. In other words, high-yield stocks can sometimes be trouble. Thankfully, this isn't always the case."", ""If you want to generate $300 in super safe dividend income in 2024, all you'd have to do is invest $3,250 into the following three ultra-high-yield stocks, which are yielding an average of 9.25%."", 'The first ultra-high-yield stock that can help deliver $300 in super-safe dividend income in the new year is energy company Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). Enterprise has raised its base annual distribution in each of the past 25 years and is currently yielding 7.6%.', 'For some investors, the idea of putting their money to work in an oil and gas stock may not sound palatable. Less than four years ago, energy stocks were clobbered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a major drawdown in the spot prices of energy commodities. The thing is, Enterprise Products Partners was largely exempted from this tumult.', ""What makes Enterprise such a winner is its operating structure. It's a midstream company, which effectively means that it's primarily responsible for transporting and storing petroleum, gas, and liquid/refined products for the upstream segment (drillers)."", ""Enterprise Products Partners' contracts with drilling companies are typically long term. More importantly, these contracts are prominently fixed-fee, which removes the effects of inflation and spot-price volatility from the equation. This gives Enterprise's management team a transparent cash-flow outlook year in and year out."", ""Being able to accurately forecast the company's operating cash flow is incredibly important. It's what's given management the confidence to outlay more than $6 billion to major projects (mostly natural gas liquids projects). It's also encouraged bolt-on acquisitions."", ""Furthermore, at no point during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic did Enterprise Products Partners' distribution coverage ratio come anywhere near a level where it would be considered unsustainable. Enterprise's contracts, coupled with favorable macroeconomic factors for the oil market (e.g., tight global oil supply caused by Russia's war with Ukraine), have set this company up to succeed for a long time to come."", 'A second supercharged income stock that can generate $300 in super safe dividend income in 2024 from a starting investment of $3,250 (split three ways) is mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY). Annaly has declared $25 billion worth of dividends since its initial public offering in October 1997 and has averaged a roughly 10% yield over the trailing two decades.', ""Things couldn't possibly have been any worse for mortgage REITs over the past two years. This is a highly interest-rate-sensitive industry, which aims to borrow money at low short-term rates and purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The steepest rate-hiking cycle by the Fed in four decades has rapidly increased short-term borrowing costs and narrowed the net interest margin for all mortgage REITs."", 'Despite the toughest climate in history for mortgage REITs, the light at the end of the tunnel appears to be drawing closer.', ""To begin with, the nation's central bank has started shifting its stance on inflation and interest rates. The consensus expectation is for three rate cuts in 2024."", ""This forecast has already been built into Treasury yields, which has minimized the steepest yield-curve inversion in more than 40 years. A normalization of the yield curve over time is going to have a positive impact on Annaly's net interest margin."", ""To add to this point, the Fed's hawkish monetary policy has increased yields on the MBS Annaly continues to purchase. Over time, these higher yields should boost the company's average yield from owned assets and expand its net interest margin."", ""Another important development for Annaly is the Federal Reserve's ongoing quantitative tightening measures. The nation's central bank is done purchasing MBS, which means there's now less competition for Annaly to contend with."", 'Lastly, Annaly Capital Management predominantly purchases agency securities. An ""agency"" asset is backed by the federal government in the unlikely event of default. Although this added protection lowers the yield Annaly receives from the MBS it\'s buying, it also allows the company to prudently utilize leverage to bulk up its profit potential.', ""The third ultra-high-yield stock that can help produce $300 in super safe annual dividend income in 2024 is none other than telecom behemoth Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Verizon's 7.1% yield is very close to its all-time high, set just a few months earlier."", 'Legacy telecom companies like Verizon were walloped in July following a report from The Wall Street Journal that suggested lead-sheathed cables still in use could pose health risks to workers and/or the environment. Since major telecom companies are lugging around quite a bit of debt, a potentially large future liability for the industry clearly has some investors concerned.', ""However, the WSJ report appears to be counting chickens before they're hatched. Not only has Verizon noted that lead-clad cables make up a small percentage of its active network, but there's also no conclusive evidence that they pose a hazard to workers or the environment."", 'Even if telecom companies were to face future liability, this would certainly be determined by the U.S. court system. Cases of this magnitude can drag on for years. In short, these claims are no immediate concern for Verizon or its shareholders.', ""What matters far more than speculation about lead-sheathed cables is that Verizon's operating needle is pointed in the right direction. The 5G revolution is leading to a steady replacement of wireless devices and is encouraging wireless customers to use more data. Verizon's wireless segment generates its juiciest margins from data."", ""Additionally, Verizon's hefty investments in mid-band spectrum seems to be paying off. The September-ended quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter where at least 400,000 net broadband subscribers were added. Being able to bring 5G download speeds to residential internet customers is a dangling carrot that should result in an increase in service bundling. It'll also be a clear positive for Verizon's operating cash flow."", ""The risk-versus-reward profile for Verizon stock makes sense for patient investors.

You can skip ahead and follow this link to see which are the 5 Very High Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into."", ""Investing in dividend stocks could be a good strategy especially if you are looking for a steady stream of income. Many companies choose to distribute at least a portion of their profits as dividends to their shareholders. In this way, investors in dividend stocks obtain income from two streams, the dividend payout and the returns generated by the stock appreciation. Companies that don't pay dividends usually reinvest them into further growth, providing investors with higher returns from stock appreciation, whereas dividends are often paid by more mature companies. Therefore, a company that pays a high dividend is also reassuring its investors regarding its financial situation."", 'Since dividend-paying companies are usually those that have built a solid position on the market and are often quite mature in terms of growth, it does mean that you, as an investor, trade off some of the returns that you can get from investing in growth companies. However, in addition to steady dividend payouts, you also get less volatility and less risk. Depending on your risk profile you can allocate various portions of your portfolio towards growth stocks and companies that pay a dividend.', 'Of course, there are different times and not always companies can maintain a steady dividend payout. However, there is an elite list of businesses, called Dividend Aristocrats, which encompasses companies that are included in the S&P 500 Index and have grown their dividends every year for at least 25 years. Despite the economy turbulence, these companies still managed to raise their dividend. In our list of very high yield dividend stocks billionaires are piling into, one company is a dividend aristocrat, as you will find out later.', 'Now, once you decide to add one or several dividend-paying companies to your portfolio, you have quite a large list to pick from. Of course you can narrow it down to the aforementioned list of dividend aristocrats, or even further to dividend kings, which are companies that have been growing their dividends for the past 50 years. For example, Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO), which is also one of the high yield dividend stocks are piling into, is a dividend king. Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) has been growing its dividend for the past 54 years. Even earlier this year, Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) added $0.04 to its quarterly dividend, taking it to $0.98 per share.', ""Alternatively, when looking for dividend stocks to invest in, you can take a look at what hedge funds are doing. Hedge funds like investing in dividend stocks as a way to obtain steady returns, but also to mitigate their risk from other investments. We have compiled a list of top 16 dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In addition, there is a select list of hedge funds, which are managed by billionaire investors. Given the solid returns that contributed to these people's high net worth, we believe it's worth taking a closer look into what billionaires are piling into."", 'Our Methodology', 'We have scanned the 13F filings of hedge funds led by billionaires and identified the most popular stocks that billionaires are bullish on as of the end of September. In order to identify the 10 very high yield dividend stocks billionaires are piling into, we looked at the dividend yields for these stocks, which represents the percentage return from dividends on every dollar invested in the stock. Once we had the dividend yield, we focused on stocks that have a dividend yield above 5%.', ""Without any further ado, let's see which companies make the list of very high yield dividend stocks billionaires are piling into."", 'Nr. of Billionaire Investors: 13', 'Dividend Yield: 6.06%', 'Our list kicks off with Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:TFC), a North Carolina-headquartered bank holding company that operates in 15 states and Washington DC.

In addition, in October, Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:TFC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, in-line with the previous payout.

Following the completion of the deal valued at $1.82 billion, Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) will get access to a pipeline system that connects the Eagle Ford basin with Mexico and Gulf Coast markets. Moreover, earlier this month, Kinder Morgan announced the prelimary guidance for 2024, saying it expects net income of $1.21 per share. In addition, the company said it plans to pay an annualized dividend of $1.15 per share in 2024, which would represent the seventh consecutive year of dividend growth."", 'Nr. of Billionaire Investors: 12', 'Dividend Yield: 6.84%', ""The stock of Eagle Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:EGBN) slid by more than 40% since the beginning of the year, amid concerns about the state of the banking sector and the US economy following the collapse of three major regional banks.

For the latest quarter, Eagle Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:EGBN) posted EPS of $0.91, beating the estimates by $0.19, while its revenue of $70.7 million came in slightly lower than expected.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have all crossed that threshold and delivered big returns to investors -- but they won't be the last. If you aren't paying attention, it's easy to miss out on the next crop of companies that have the potential to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. The following three stocks have the growth profiles, size, and competitive advantages that will likely propel them into this rarified club within the next decade."", 'Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) dominates the customer relationship management (CRM) software industry, dwarfing its closest competitors in market share. Salesforce has become a standard tool for professionals in customer-facing roles, and its product suite is a trusted resource to improve the efficiency and overall performance of sales te ms. The company has built a wide moat based on high switching costs and a network effect, solidifying its competitive position.', ""Salesforce is transitioning to a new era as it matures amid global macroeconomic weakness. The company's growth rate has been slowing, and it has shifted focus toward profitability by managing operating expenses. That's been a common theme among tech companies over the past year."", ""Salesforce has adeptly managed this shift by slashing its expense budgets. This has propelled adjusted operating margins over 30%, placing the cloud software provider firmly into profitability. Salesforce expects free cash flow to grow more than 30% this fiscal year. These results clearly demonstrate that this business can produce strong cash flows, making it a less speculative investment than in previous years during its high-growth, high-burn phase. It's still expanding at an impressive pace, and there's a chance that it could accelerate once again when economic conditions improve. Renewed spending sales and product development could catalyze future growth, especially if AI enhancements stimulate demand for the platform."", ""Salesforce's market cap is around $250 billion right now. It's trading at a very reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below 30 and a price-to-cash-flow ratio around 26. If its earnings continue to outpace sales growth, the valuation is reasonable enough for Salesforce's market cap to quadruple over the next decade."", 'Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has enjoyed decades as one of the leading providers of creative software. Customers use the suite of tools to create digital images, videos, graphics, and documents. The company has added additional functions over the years, such as marketing, publishing, and analytics, entrenching Adobe as the market leader for content creation software.', ""Adobe's 12% growth rate last year follows a similar trend to Salesforce. The company's growth is slowing, but it's still expanding at an impressive rate. Adobe successfully drove profit margins higher by controlling costs, and its earnings growth is outpacing revenue. The company is delivering close to 35% operating margin, and it's an excellent cash flow generator."", 'AI presents both potential threats and opportunities for Adobe. The company has invested heavily in AI capabilities for years, which have been weaved increasingly into its product suite to support digital creators in new ways. However, there are concerns that AI could change the competitive landscape and ultimately hurt demand for Adobe products. That creates uncertainty for investors, but it also prevents upside.', ""Adobe's market cap is around $275 billion, with a forward P/E ratio of 30. If the company's offering isn't deeply disrupted by the proliferation of AI, it's a strong candidate to surpass $1 trillion in market cap over the next few years."", ""ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) provides a popular IT workflow platform with excellent traction among large enterprise customers from all industries. It's become an integral part of operations and effective digital transformation for nearly 1,800 companies. Its product quality and deep penetration of its target market have secured ServiceNow's place at the table for years to come."", ""Recent results have been highly encouraging. ServiceNow reported 25% revenue growth last quarter, along with nearly $200 million in free cash flow. The company's profit growth is outpacing sales thanks to discipline on operating expense budgets and economies of scale. ServiceNow also boasts a 98% customer retention rate, which indicates high customer satisfaction and effective sales processes. These are the exact features that investors should identify in stocks with sustainable growth catalysts."", ""ServiceNow's forward P/E ratio is close to 60, so it's a bit more expensive than the other stocks covered above. Its high growth rate and cash flow generation command a premium, so it's no shock that the stock has pricier valuation ratios. Even with aggressive expectations to meet, ServiceNow's outlook creates the opportunity for its market cap to grow from $140 billion today. It has a longer way to go than Adobe or Salesforce, but a couple more years of strong execution should help it close that gap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Salesforce wasn't one of them.

The success of growth stocks has been a key reason why the broad index has been doing so well. And three of the best-performing ones in the S&P this year have been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL). But can these scorching-hot stocks still be good buys heading into the new year?', ""Nvidia has been the biggest benefactor from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) this year. Demand for its AI chips has been through the roof, and data-center revenue has been flourishing as well. Last quarter, which ended on Oct. 29, the company posted record data-center revenue of $14.5 billion; it rose 279% year over year. Nvidia's overall sales of $18.1 billion were more than three times the $5.9 billion it reported a year ago."", 'Given its strong results, it may not be surprising that the stock itself more than tripled in value this year. The big question for investors, however, is whether this still is a good buy heading into 2024. At around 65 times earnings, the stock has an inflated valuation.', ""I believe next year may be a tougher one for the markets, and companies may scale back on their spending due to a potential recession, which could lead to a slowdown in Nvidia's customers ramping up their AI offerings. For that reason, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia's stock falls in value in 2024."", ""But as long as you're willing to hold on to the stock for the long haul, it can still make for a great investment. Analysts from Gartner project that the demand for AI chips could double by 2027. And with Nvidia being the big name in AI chips, and helping businesses automate their operations and get into the cloud, it can still be a top growth stock to buy and hold in the years ahead."", ""Shares of Meta Platforms are up 180% since January. Investors have become more bullish on the business amid a stronger ad market. But that too could come under pressure next year. While there is the hope that interest rates decline next year and there is a soft landing for the economy, the potential for a worse-than-expected recession could throw a wrench into Meta's growth. And while the company did achieve 23% revenue growth last quarter (period ended Sept. 30), that isn't typical for the business."", ""I'm not optimistic Meta can maintain this level of revenue growth. Meanwhile, its metaverse business, Reality Labs, continues to cost the company billions in earnings. While there's a lot of hype surrounding Meta's business this year, I think it may be approaching a peak."", ""At around 31 times earnings, this isn't a stock I'd consider buying for next year as its valuation is too pricey given that its surge in growth may not be sustainable, and there are still the losses relating to Reality Labs to worry about. Those factors could hinder the stock's performance in the future."", 'The cruise industry has been recovering this year. With no more lockdowns and travel restrictions no longer a concern, Royal Caribbean Cruises stock has been one of the hottest stocks to own this year, soaring by 150%.', 'Through the first nine months of the year, the company reported revenue of $10.6 billion, up 69% from the previous year. Royal Caribbean is also back to posting profits, with its bottom line during that stretch totaling $1.4 billion compared to a loss of $1.7 billion in the same period in 2022.', 'While the stock looks expensive at a price-to-earnings multiple of 37, with Royal Caribbean still in recovery mode, its earnings numbers should continue to improve. This is one of the stocks that I think could still do well in a potential downturn next year as cruises cater to an older, more affluent customer base, which could provide some much-needed resiliency for investors.', ""With oil prices also coming down, which should help improve profitability, and demand still looking strong, Royal Caribbean's stock could continue to be a great buy heading into next year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

To put the icing on the cake, Tesla was the first ever EV to achieve this distinction, according to automotive industry publication GreenCars."", ""The final numbers aren't yet in, but Tesla is expected to sell 1.8 million cars this year, which would represent growth of about 38% -- remarkable considering the economic headwinds of the past couple of years. Over the longer term, Tesla is working to increase vehicle production by a compound annual growth rate of 50%. Once the economic headwinds subside, demand will likely ramp up."", ""Despite Tesla's lofty gains so far this year, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas is still remarkably bullish, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $380, implying additional upside of 50%. He believes investors underestimate the potential of Tesla's ancillary services, including batteries and full self-driving. Furthermore, he suggests the competition is outmatched, and Tesla will continue to capture even greater EV market share."", ""Tesla remains a battleground stock. Of the 47 analysts who issued an opinion in November, 18 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, 21 rated it a hold, and 8 suggested selling, with most citing the stock's frothy valuation.

As investors, we must always be learning from our mistakes, and fine tuning our methodology, because there is no end-goal, just a constantly evolving process. If you love learning you can do very well in markets.', 'As 2023 nears an end, it is a good time to reflect on the year of trading so we can identify what worked and what didn’t. Although I will be sharing the things that I learned this year, I think they are broadly applicable to all investors.', 'Want to hear something crazy? The S&P500 never traded below the low of the first day of the year. That means the stock index never went negative YTD once! And yet 2023 was almost unanimously expected to experience a recession and market selloff.', 'This is why it is so important to really listen to what the market tells you and try to read through the most popular narratives swirling around the market. The price action tells you everything you need to know.', 'While the economists were referring to their models, they forgot about the best economic forecasting tool in the world, the market itself. Because the stock market is a forward discounting mechanism, it is almost always doing a better job at discounting future risks than any individual analyst or trader.', 'Many commentators on the internet will often say, retail investors looking for alpha should focus on micro and small cap stocks if they want an edge. However, I wholeheartedly disagree. I personally have always been one to closely follow the large and mega cap stocks, especially tech, and many of them returned more than 100% just this year.', 'Nvidia and Meta Platforms, two of the largest companies in the world, were the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. The setups were quite compelling, with Meta Platforms ending 2023 at its lowest relative valuation in a decade and Nvidia leading the Artificial Intelligence revolution.', 'Both stocks were also steadily trending higher, confirming bullish price action all year.', 'This year was my first year at Zacks and my first time using the proprietary tools. I was constantly impressed with how effective they were at anticipating which stocks would be the top performers.', 'In my years I have gone through many different filtering and signal generation tools, and the Zacks Rank has easily been one of, if not the simplest and most effective for identifying winning stocks.', 'For example, Nvidia and Meta Platforms enjoyed Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings for many months and sat atop the list right from the beginning of the year. Because the Zacks Rank aggregates the earnings estimates and revisions from all analysts on Wall Street, it provides a broad opinion on expectations, like the way the market functions.', 'As earnings estimates trend higher, institutional traders begin buying the stock thus pushing it higher. In the chart below, which shows the earnings estimate trend of META, following the upgrades in February the stocks rallied higher all year.', 'Of course, hindsight is 20/20, and though Meta Platforms and Nvidia were top Zacks Rank stocks, many investors doubted they would continue to trade higher all year. Although it isn’t a new insight, good trading requires courage. You must form your opinion and stick to it, even if that goes against the herd.', 'Often, going against the herd is a fantastic signal that you may be following the right path, however you should use the principles shared above to confirm the thesis. Price action should be confirming the thesis, you should understand why a stock is moving, and the Zacks Rank should be showing upward trending earnings revisions.', 'Best of luck in 2024!', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

To read more on the global streaming industry, check out our coverage of 15 Biggest Streaming and TV Companies in the US.\xa0', 'The global video streaming industry is projected to be impacted by certain trends in 2024, with the rising importance of attention metrics topping the charts. Companies are racing to curate better experiences for their consumers so that constant advertisements can be rewarded with genuine consumer attention. To improve profitability in 2024, advertisers would be well-advised to embrace the attention economy and build better mechanisms to understand which type of attention is best suited for their brand/KPI. In this vein, more companies will adopt attention metrics to augment legacy standards like reach, frequency, impressions, and page views. However, advertisers maintain that the utility of attention metrics is not definite and companies like Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc.

With streaming options becoming a mainstay in digital media overall, the market has gotten increasingly fragmented. As subscription growth decelerates and overall churn increases, platforms are realizing the need to establish effective ad-supported options which don't turn audiences off from the product. In order to achieve this, companies must optimize partnerships and demonstrate intent to integrate technological capabilities to reduce the pressure on publishers across the industry.\xa0According to an analysis by McKinsey, the streaming landscape will be incredibly different for the consumer by 2030. As technology shrinks the world and coalesces it into a global marketplace for content, by 2030, content will transcend current borders in a way where content from anywhere will be available to consumers all around the world. Consumers will likely be able to select the language in which they want to consume some of the  best serial killer documentaries on Netflix and other streaming services, opening up the market and improving potential for profitability for streaming players."", 'According to a report by The New York Times, the economics of content creation largely tip in the favor of multi-part docuseries and other types of documentary features, especially some of the best serial killer documentaries on Netflix and other streaming services. Documentaries tend to have lower production costs, owing to smaller crews, fewer elaborate sets, and the extensive reliance on existing footage and interviews. Production cost is largely reserved for travel, equipment, and post-production editing. Furthermore, since documentaries tend to tap into incredibly niche markets, it is able to attract a loyal consumer base. Lower production costs and the increased potential for targeted appeal causes overall return-on-investment (ROI) to skyrocket exponentially. In this vein, streaming giants like Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have diverted significant investments in the production of documentaries and docuseries. According to an analysis by the New York Film Academy, the selection of Netflix documentaries and docuseries have increased exponentially over the last couple of years, with more than 90 documentaries on the streaming platform as of April 2023.\xa0', 'In its Q3 2024 earnings report, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported a massive decline in ad revenue weighing on its top line, despite earnings topping expectations due to profit at ESPN+ and the continued growth of its theme parks. Due to this, the company has made public its plan to ""aggressively manage"" its cost base, slashing total expenditure by an additional $2 billion in efforts to achieve a target of $7.5 billion in total cost cuts. Although the company\'s streaming business narrowed its losses year-over-year, total losses for 2023 have amounted to more than $400 million. In total, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has lost more than $10 million on its streaming service venture since it was launched in 2019. The platform bled more than 11.7 million subscribers globally in Q3 2023.', ""According to a report by The New York Times, the depreciation was exacerbated due to a low-priced version of Disney+ in the Indian market. In 2022, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) lost a bid to renew the lucrative rights of the Indian Premier League cricket matches, causing the platform to lose millions of subscribers. To make streaming a more profitable venture, the company's CEO Robert Iger has shifted focus away from a brisk subscriber growth model, in a bid to cut down on expensive marketing campaigns. Instead, the company is aiming to attain a higher value to its existing consumer base. In December 2022, the monthly price for access to an ad-free configuration of Disney+ rose to $11 from $8. The company doubled down on this strategy in October 2023 by increasing the price of Disney-run Hulu, with began charging $18 for ad-free access, up from $15. According to the CEO, the company intend to divert more subscription to the advertiser-supported tier to maximize revenue and rake in profits. This strategy, coupled with management's commitment to follow in the footsteps of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and crack down on password sharing caused The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) share price to appreciate by more than 2% in late November.\xa0"", 'However, since the company still relies on old-line channels like ESPN and ABC for more than 33% of its operating profits, these traditional channels raked in a quarterly operating income of roughly $1.9 billion in Q3 2023, down 23 percent year-over year. This is due to the fact that traditional TV outlets are being decimated by cord cutting, sports programming costs, and rampant advertiser pullback. You can read more on the current atmosphere of cord cutting and its impact on streaming companies in our coverage of 10 Best Live Streaming Services for Cord Cutters in 2023. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) attributed lower ad sales on its traditional TV segment to a decline in viewership and lower payments from ESPN subscribers, in addition to skyrocketing sports programming costs. To navigate around this predicament, the company\'s CEO has made it clear that he is looking for “strategic partners that could either help us with distribution or content"".\xa0', 'Evan Lorne / Shutterstock.com ', 'To compile our list of the 20 best serial killer documentaries on Netflix and other streaming services, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

Investors can set themselves up for success by buying shares of companies with solid long-term prospects that are trading at reasonable valuations and holding on tight.', ""I'm betting that International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), AT&T (NYSE: T), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), and American Tower (NYSE: AMT) will deliver in 2024 and beyond. Here's why."", 'Cloud computing is complicated. So is artificial intelligence. For large enterprises and organizations with vast IT infrastructures and low risk tolerances, moving everything to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or tapping OpenAI may not be viable options.', ""IBM has positioned itself as a critical partner for enterprises looking to digitally transform and modernize their operations. The company's hybrid cloud platform can run anywhere, enabling clients to mix and match public clouds and their own private data centers. And watsonx, IBM's new enterprise AI platform, is tailor-made for enterprises that need to ensure their proprietary data remains safe and that they comply with regulatory requirements."", ""IBM expects to grow revenue by 3% to 5% this year, driven by strong demand for digital-transformation projects that deliver clear returns on investment for customers. IBM certainly isn't the fastest growing tech company, but valued at just 14 times forward free cash flow, it doesn't need to be to produce solid returns for investors."", 'What stands out about Intel is how many ways it can win. The company is best known for its PC and server central processing units (CPUs), but it also sells graphics cards, AI accelerators, and other specialized chips. In addition to making its own chips, Intel is building a foundry business to rival market leader TSMC. With the launch of the Intel 18A manufacturing process scheduled for late 2024, Intel expects to gain a technological advantage.', ""No matter where the semiconductor industry goes, Intel will benefit through its foundry business. As demand for AI accelerators continues to explode, not only does Intel sell its Gaudi AI chips and data-center graphics processing units (GPUs), but it could eventually manufacture AI chips for others. If Arm-based PCs become a thing, Intel will be ready to manufacture those Arm chips thanks to a collaboration with Arm. Once the Intel 18A process is ready, the company's total addressable market will expand dramatically."", ""Intel stock is down around 33% from its pandemic-era high, and the company has a market value below that of rival AMD. Neither will remain true for long as Intel's foundry strategy plays out over the next few years."", 'Telecom giant AT&T has a lot of debt, and its expensive fumbles in the media industry should rightly give investors some pause. But the company has gotten back to basics. Fiber internet and 5G wireless are the core focuses. The wireless business continues to gain subscribers, albeit at a slower rate than last year, and the fiber business is steadily expanding.', ""AT&T expects to generate free cash flow of $16.5 billion this year, and the company's capital intensity should ease over the next few years as the 5G investment cycle winds down. A recent move to revamp its wireless infrastructure with more flexible hardware and software could free up some capital to grow other businesses, including fiber internet, a bit faster."", ""AT&T trades for just 7 times free-cash-flow guidance and sports a 6.7% dividend yield. The company's results are sensitive to economic conditions, but that valuation seems far too pessimistic to me."", ""The reason to own Disney stock is simple: The iconic company will eventually figure out how to make its valuable intellectual property and assets work in the age of streaming. Disney's linear TV business has long been a cash cow, but that won't remain the case forever."", ""The company is focusing on four areas: Making the streaming business profitable, turning ESPN into a digital sports powerhouse, fixing the film business that's been stumbling in the post-pandemic era, and accelerating growth in the experiences business, which includes the company's parks and its cruise line."", ""Disney's superpower has always been its ability to have each business feed into and strengthen the others, fueled by its vast catalog of media assets. It will take time for Disney to fully right the ship, but there's little reason to believe the company won't eventually figure it out."", 'American Tower owns cell towers and other communications assets around the world. While its growth depends on the capital spending of its telecom customers, long-term contracts make its revenue extremely predictable. As long as demand for mobile data continues to rise, American Tower will benefit as wireless providers race to keep pace with each other.', 'Shares of American Tower have rallied over the past two months, but the stock still looks like a solid deal. The company has been consistently raising its dividend, even throughout the pandemic. The stock currently has a dividend yield of about 3.2 %, more than double that of the S&P 500.', ""American Tower's business is about as stable as they come.

For an insurance giant that prides itself on being financially rock solid, the recent economic situation was incredibly rough.', 'In particular, rising interest rates played havoc for the company, as it owns over $300 billion in bonds, all held as available for sale or as trading positions. When interest rates rise, the prices of existing fixed-rate bonds fall. In its 2022 annual report, Prudential Financial indicated that it had nearly $30 billion in interest rate related risks on its balance sheet, down from $40 billion the previous year.', 'Now that the Federal Reserve has indicated that it thinks it is done boosting rates, and indeed, that it might lower them in 2024, that rate-related pressure looks to be behind Prudential Financial. Given its bond-heavy balance sheet, the easing of those pressures is a key driver of why Prudential Financial is my top value stock to buy right now.', 'Analysts expect Prudential Financial to close out 2023 earning a total of $11.78 per share for the year, and they have an average forecast of $13.31 per share in income for 2024.

Prudential Financial, on the other hand, is projected to achieve a solid 10.5% annualized earnings growth rate over the next five or so years.

The company currently pays a dividend of $1.25 per share per quarter, putting its yield at around 4.8%. Prudential Financial has a decent recent history of annual dividend increases, and with its $5 annual payment consuming less than half of its anticipated earnings, it may very well continue that dividend growth.', ""Then there's its rock solid balance sheet. Prudential Financial bases its whole corporate identity around that fact, using the Rock of Gibraltar as its corporate logo. The $300 billion in bonds on its balance sheet support a total shareholder equity above $26 billion."", ""An insurance company's balance sheet is critical to its success because the company is in the business of pricing and paying out on financial risks. Even if Prudential Financial's risk pricing models get it right on average, the reality is that people tend to buy insurance for the bigger risks that they face. If a whole lot of things go wrong at once for its clients, a strong balance sheet is crucial to the company's ability to pay out on those larger-than-expected claims."", ""While Prudential Financial looks like a value-priced company based on its prospects, based on its trailing earnings, the story isn't so clear. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 30, which may be scaring off people who are using automatic screeners with backward-looking metrics to look for bargains."", 'That high trailing price-to-earnings ratio is driven by a major set of write-offs in the October through December quarter of last year. Those write-offs look like they were one-time events, including over $1 billion from interest rate related investment losses.', ""Those one-time charges will roll off the company's trailing-12-month price-to-earnings ratio once it reports its final set of earnings for 2023. After that report, if it delivers as expected, its bargain price may simply be too cheap for the overall market to ignore.

It's sitting on a gain of 26% (including dividends), which reverses all of its losses from 2022."", 'Historical data going back to 1957 says rebound years like 2023 have always been followed by second positive year. That bodes very well for 2024 -- we could be looking at a gain of 15.5% in the S&P 500 in 2024, based on the average return of the last 11 times a down year in the market was followed by a rebound year.', ""But I think two stocks could deliver an even higher return in 2024. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) each have a strong presence in cloud computing, and they are rapidly growing their portfolios of artificial intelligence (AI) products. Here's why they have all the right qualities to beat the market."", ""Oracle was founded in 1977 and it has a stellar track record of success, which makes it a great investment in any given year. The launch of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 laid the foundation for the company's growing presence in the artificial intelligence space."", ""OCI is a broad platform that allows businesses to build and operate different applications at scale. When digital workloads require a significant amount of computing power, OCI's centralized data centers are a great choice because they are fitted with the latest computer chips. AI happens to be one of the most compute-hungry technologies in history, and it's the reason Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) have been in such high demand this year."", 'AI models are used for a growing number of tasks. Consumer-facing generative AI applications like ChatGPT can create text, images, videos, and computer code on demand. Businesses, on the other hand, run AI in the background to analyze high volumes of data. Research shows increasing scale is the surest way to make AI models more accurate; more data and more training leads to better outcomes. Hence, the demand for computing power is soaring.', 'In fact, in Oracle\'s recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), Chairman Larry Ellison said the company was expanding 66 of its existing data centers and building 100 more. He told investors the demand for OCI and generative AI services is increasing at an ""astronomical rate,"" and Oracle simply can\'t keep up. Building new infrastructure takes time, but Nvidia is also facing so much demand that there is a shortage of its GPUs, which Oracle needs.', ""During Q2, the OCI segment generated $1.6 billion in revenue. While that only accounted for 12% of Oracle's total $12.9 billion in sales for the quarter, it was a 52% year-over-year increase, making it the fastest-growing part of the company. Ellison says OCI will likely grow at 50% for years to come, so it won't be long before it's a significant part of the revenue base."", ""Ellison says OCI's new Gen2 Cloud is now the No. 1 choice among generative AI developers, and it attracted top start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI. They have already committed to spending billions of dollars on Gen2 Cloud computing capacity, but not even Musk can get his hands on enough."", 'But 2024 could be a breakout year for Oracle as more of its new data centers come on line. Plus, given its stock sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 29 right now, it would have to rise 23% just to trade in line with the 36 P/E of Microsoft, another leader in AI cloud services.

The company is worth just $3.1 billion, while its competitors -- Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Alphabet's Google Cloud -- are backed by their trillion-dollar parent companies."", ""In order to thrive in that environment, DigitalOcean delivers cloud services primarily to small and midsize businesses -- typically those in the start-up phase to those with 500 employees. Revenue per customer is relatively low at this end of the market, so it isn't a focus area for the large providers."", ""The strategy works for DigitalOcean because it delivers a narrow range of cloud services, so it doesn't have the bloated cost structure of its bigger competitors. It offers customers transparent pricing, personalized service, and educational material to help them extract the most from their cloud experience. But in July, DigitalOcean acquired AI cloud platform provider Paperspace, which is on a mission to make high-performance computing available to the smallest of enterprises -- so the two companies appear to be a great fit."", 'DigitalOcean already offers customers the basics like data storage, server hosting, and the infrastructure with which to build software applications. But Paperspace brings data centers fitted with the latest GPUs, which are required to develop, train, and deploy AI models. It offers customers pricing that is up to 70% cheaper than Microsoft Azure, making it the perfect provider for start-ups.', 'DigitalOcean values its addressable market at $98 billion, but the addition of AI services could launch the company into an opportunity worth 100 times more over the long term. Depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, generative AI could add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.', ""DigitalOcean stock is trading 71% below its all-time high following the brutal pullback in tech valuations in 2022. Based on the company's $675 million in trailing 12-month revenue, its shares trade at a price-to-sales ratio of just 4.6."", ""That's near the cheapest level since DigitalOcean came public in 2021, so investors might want to scoop up the stock before the Paperspace integration starts to bear fruit."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

And we’ll see even more of them in 2024. All three companies have already introduced chips capable of on-board AI processing, and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel 8 Pro is running that company’s next-generation Gemini Nano generative AI model. And the number of devices running on-board generative AI will only expand from there.', 'Local generative AI apps will provide consumers with a greater sense of privacy and security, since the platforms won’t need to send user data to the cloud to do things like perform searches or organize information.', 'Apple could also jump on the generative AI bandwagon. During the company’s Q4 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook laid out how Apple already uses AI technologies across a number of its offerings including Live Voicemail and fall detection. Cook also specifically mentioned that Apple is investing in its own generative AI capabilities, and that could mean a smarter Siri.', ""“We will see more AI and Apple talking about generative AI built into Siri,” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “That's, from a consumer and a stock perspective, something that I think would be positive for Apple shares next year.”"", 'Investors, meanwhile, will be looking for returns on Big Tech’s AI investments from the prior year.', ""“They need to start driving incremental revenue,” explained Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud … my expectation is that you're going to have people actually buying and paying money for these incremental services.”"", 'Yes, AI will continue to drive headlines in 2024, but one other story might just rival the artificial intelligence bonanza: Apple’s Vision Pro headset. The augmented/virtual reality “spacial computer,” as Apple refers to it, will make its debut next year.', 'The $3,499 Vision Pro marks the first time Apple has entered a new product category since it debuted the Apple Watch in 2015. I was blown away when I tried an early version of the Vision Pro in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference. The technology felt as though it was worlds ahead of what rivals like Meta had to offer at the time.', 'Meta is the AR/VR headset market leader thanks to its Quest headsets and limited competition, but its Reality Labs division, which produces the Quest devices, loses billions of dollars each year.', 'If Apple is going to make the Vision Pro a hit, it will need to convince consumers that they need the headset, something Meta has struggled with.', ""“I think it's going to take five to eight years to gain traction, but I think [the Vision Pro] is going to ultimately be an exciting part of consumer tech,” said Munster."", 'Autonomous cars faced a number of setbacks in 2023 including GM suspending its Cruise self-driving taxi business after a vehicle dragged a person. Elon Musk’s Tesla, meanwhile, was forced to issue an over-the-air update to 2 million vehicles on the road in the US to address concerns that the company’s cars didn’t warn people about how to properly use its advanced driver assistance technology.', 'According to Moorhead, the automotive and tech industries underestimated how difficult it would be to get autonomous vehicles up and running at any scale.', 'But there’s still plenty of interest in the technology, and there will be no shortage of autonomous announcements throughout 2024 starting at the Consumer Electronic Show next month.', 'Nvidia, Qualcomm, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Toyota — they’re all working on advanced driver assistance technologies, which are a lead-in to self-driving vehicles.', 'Companies may, however, begin tempering expectations as to when full self-driving vehicles will eventually hit the road.

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Satya Kumar, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir."", 'Satya Kumar', ""Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Post-Earnings Analyst Call. On the call with me today are Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, EVP of our Global Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO. As a reminder, the matters we're discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply, market trends and drivers, our expected results and guidance and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. We can now open up for Q&A."", 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.', 'Ambrish Srivastava', ""I had a couple of clarifications. I just wanted to make sure I was on the same page as the prior comments. Just talking about the data center inventory cleaning out by first half '24, that seems to be extended versus -- I think prior comments were in the beginning of the year. And kind of related to that, is that -- is my understanding correct that now it's pushed out to first half '24? And then is that a comment because of the strategic buys that you guys have seen. So it is a Micron-specific comment? Or is that an industry-wide comment that you made? And then I had a quick follow-up."", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. Ambrish, yes. So on the data center side, there are some customers whose inventory will be normalized, let's say, in the Q1 time frame, there may be some who will get into Q2 before their inventory is normalized. That's why we -- being said sometime in the first half because certain customers have experienced some lower end market growth in the last many months. And consequently, their consumption of the inventory has been slower, and that is what may bleed into Q2 from Q1 and I'm talking about calendar Q1, Q2 for 2024. And it's nothing much to do with any of the strategic buy so much, and it's more to do with the total extent of the DRAM and NAND inventory at large data center customers. So we believe it will be mostly normalized in the first half and then more robust buying patterns coming in, in the second half. And then as the overall data center, general purpose compute growth accelerates, which you have seen general purpose servers actually fell -- likely to fall for calendar 2023 at a double-digit rate, server unit volume for general purpose needs, we expect that to stabilize in 2024, be sort of flattish general purpose server unit volumes and then grow from that point on. So second half of '24 calendar year and then calendar year '25 more robust growth along all of those fronts."", 'Ambrish Srivastava', ""Got it. So I was correct. A bit of a pushout, but not a Micron-specific comment. That's more an industry comment. So my follow-up maybe for Manish. As we think about cost down, I think you guys have been talking about high single digits for I think a couple of years from when it used to be mid-teens DRAM cost down. Just trying to understand that HBM higher packaging costs, stacking, does that change -- you did give guide for '24, which is high single digit. But beyond that, does DRAM now start to come lower than that in terms of cost down?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. For front end, you're right, we did say mid- to high single digits was our long-term expectation for front end or memory level cost reduction. And that factors in a few different things. One, of course, is technology and how technology is getting more challenging, cadence of technology that's capable for the industry and for us. And yes, there is an element of mix of technology. Certainly, we're transitioning from DDR4 to DDR5, and DDR5 has some structurally higher -- larger die sizes, and so some cost increases as we move there. And yes, as HBM penetration grows in the industry, we've said for the industry in HBM3E, the die size is double. So even within the front-end cost, which is what we were guiding to, we do see that the industry's construction capability will be coming down somewhat from what we had seen previously."", 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""At the risk of splitting hairs, so if I look at your deck from last quarter, you talked about DRAM calendar year '24-bit demand exceeding the long-term CAGR. Now you're saying closer to near the long-term demand, is that the server side that's causing that downtick? And if you put yourselves back in the position of last quarter, has pricing improved enough where you would expect that, that would offset that downtick in demand when you're looking at revenue and free cash flow kind of for the full year? In other words, can that more than offset what you're seeing a slight downtick to mid?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Our overall expectation of demand for 2024 at the aggregate bit level hasn't really changed that much, but you may have noticed that we have taken up our view of 2023 demand growth in DRAM from mid-single digit to high single digits. And so it's really a movement of some bits across the year-end boundary. And that's what increased some of the bits in 2023. And hence, with that higher base, the year-on-year growth in 2024 is, on a percentage basis, not as high as it used to be earlier. With that said, we have definitely more confident and optimistic view about pricing than we did 3 months ago, and we do expect the pricing to -- and you've seen that in our guidance in terms of revenue as well as gross margin for FQ2. And we do expect pricing to continue to improve for 2024 throughout calendar '24 and our financial results to improve alongside mainly driven by the fact that the leading-edge nodes for both DRAM and NAND are oversubscribed for the full year. And so I don't see any kind of an impact on the change that you were mentioning on a revenue basis, the revenue change should be a positive."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You obviously started the year on the DRAM side, very strong from a bit perspective. You're guiding slightly down, I would say, for the next 2 quarters for February and May. Could you talk about just how severe that downtick may be? And when you look at what you're talking about for mid-teens demand kind of near the long-term CAGR, I mean, it would require a pretty big downtick at least from your supply perspective to get there. So just kind of help frame out those next 2 quarters? Is it stepping down materially from February and May off of that? Or just the linearity of those bit declines would be really helpful."", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. I can provide a little bit of color on that. So if you just go back to our 2023 fiscal year, our bits bottomed in FQ1 of 2023, our revenue bottomed in FQ2. And so throughout the fiscal 2023, our bits have been growing through the course of the fiscal year. And we enter 2024 at a pretty good run rate of bits compared to where 2023 started on a fiscal year basis. And then as you noted, in Q1, our bit growth was pretty strong in DRAM. So we actually don't need a huge amount of sequential growth in 2024 to have pretty robust year-on-year bit growth, fiscal '24 over fiscal '23 because of those base effects. With that said, if you just look at the environment right now, our leading-edge supply is obviously pretty constrained due to all of the history of CapEx cuts that we have gone through, the industry has gone through. And so our leading-edge bits are fully subscribed. We do have -- oversubscribed. We do have some inventory that we will obviously use to supplement our sales, supplement our production in 2024. But with that said, we have also some seasonality that typically occurs in CQ1 for the consumer portions of our business. And we have not enough supply of leading-edge bits in this time frame. So that's -- those are all of the things that are coming together to cause our bit shipments in DRAM to be -- and NAND both to be down a little bit in FQ2 sequentially, on the DRAM side, not growing in FQ3 either, will likely be down in FQ3. NAND, we'll see where things stand in FQ3, but we do expect both DRAM and NAND to have some modest sequential growth in FQ4. And we do expect pricing to be the prime driver throughout each of those quarters for revenue, margins, financial performance throughout that time horizon."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""I wonder if you could give us some sense of the relative profitability of NAND versus DRAM at this point? I know you had mentioned in the call that the DRAM mix was still helpful to gross margins, but I would have thought with the increase in price that you saw in NAND that you're starting to get close. Can you just give us some sense of how close the 2 [declines] are?"", 'Sumit Sadana', 'Yes. I mean the profitability of DRAM at a gross margin level is definitely higher than that of NAND. This has continued a trend that has been in place for quite some time where DRAM profitability throughout the cycle tends to be higher than NAND profitability. With that said, NAND bit decline at an industry gross margin level more than even DRAM in this downturn. So we do expect that because it declined more from a ASP perspective and from a gross margin perspective, the bounce will obviously have to be steeper in NAND in order to restore some level of acceptable ROI. So the pace of price increases in NAND to dig out of that hole will have to be just mathematically bigger. But we are seeing tightness in both DRAM and NAND, especially on the leading-edge nodes, they are in shortage in both DRAM and NAND. And so both of those should continue to improve. But just because NAND has a deeper hole to dig out of, its absolute -- its percentage increases will just be higher.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""Great. That's helpful. And then for a unrelated follow-up, I wonder if you look at the high capital spending in memory in China, obviously, severe limitations on what they're allowed to spend money on, but you might have geopolitical incentive to use those bits in devices where you wouldn't ordinarily use trailing edge [bits]. Can you just give us some sense of how you guys perceive that supply coming out of China to be relevant to the global supply demand?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', 'Sure, Joe. So I think you correctly highlight that technologies that are in production in China are behind the leading-edge nodes in the industry. And we -- so we do have modeled the supply for both DRAM and NAND as part of the global demand that we see -- or global supply against the global demand models that we have, and we do model them being able to continue. However, their impact on the market, given the fact that they are trailing is commensurate with that position, both based on their -- the ability for those technologies to generate supply as well as their ability to compete in higher-end applications when they have nodes that are less competitive in terms of features or performance and, for example, if industry transitions to more complicated products like HBM or others.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.', 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""I guess maybe, Mark, just wanted to ask a question on the front-end cost reductions in fiscal '24 for mid- to high single digits in DRAM and low double digits in NAND. I thought previously, you guys thought that the cost reductions in fiscal '24 might be affected by underutilization charges and those costs flowing through inventory through COGS. And so I'm I guess I'm wondering, can you clarify, is that inclusive of underutilization charges? Or is that just front-end wafer and excludes any utilization or underutilization effect?"", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Yes. It does include the underutilization effect. And Quinn, it's a good question, and it's -- in the case of DRAM, it's all in. So -- but operationally, we do expect FY '24 to be a year of improved efficiencies across the factories. As we've talked about, the -- we've got structurally lower capacity as we migrate idle tools from lagging to leading nodes. Now there's still some underutilization in those lagging nodes, but we will see the idle charges decrease through the year and starting in the second quarter. And between that and then just the tech node migrations, more of the capacity going to leading nodes, we're going to see that positively affect the front-end cost reductions for both DRAM and NAND. So you're seeing that happen here, incrementally positive to the view we had before. We've covered it quite a bit over the past year, so I'm not going to go through all that. But in summary, some of the underloading effect, as you know, hits COGS as period costs, while some of it's absorbed. And the part that is absorbed is in the higher cost inventory. So in fiscal Q2, we'll have much lower idle related period costs. And again, it's mostly related to this increased utilization from -- and the idle costs remaining will be mostly legacy node related. And then you'll have this portion of underload that's in inventories is higher cost and as we move through the year, this will clear and become less of an effect. So in total, we end up with what we communicated today, which is front-end costs and in the case of DRAM, all-in costs, mid- to high single digits down for '24. Now in NAND, we said low teens and front-end costs down, which we will see, but because of more of a mix shift on components and modules, we'll see below 10% more of mid- to high single-digit cost downs for NAND all in just for your modeling."", 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up question, just wanted to come back to the question that was asked on the call about HBM3E. If you guys have 10% better performance, 30% better power, do you think -- do you expect to be sole sourced on the SKUs you win or to the extent that there are multiple sources, will the customer have to derate your HBM to have similar performance across the 2 SKUs?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. I mean it's a good question. Our customers have been amazed at the capabilities that we have created with HBM3E versus what others have been able to do with this product. And this is -- this has been part of our strategy to defog HBM3 and go to HBM3E, first to market where they create a world-class product better than anyone else. And so this is panning out. Our customers have different approaches that they are assessing in how to take advantage of this capability on the performance and power side in terms of what type of products they use our HBM in? What kind of SKUs do they create with that? What kind of multi-sourcing strategy do they have to support their whole portfolio and while we are working with them on our designs and integration of our designs with their GPUs, we are not at liberty to discuss those strategies and we'll leave it at that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.', 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', ""Question on your -- when you look at your DRAM and NAND CapEx and the comments that I made on the bit supply, can you talk to what your wafer capacity would be exiting calendar '23 and how you see that exceeding calendar '24?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""I think what we've given the -- Vijay, I think we've given guidance mainly on sort of fiscal year to fiscal year. So if you allow me to do that, we've said that the -- we were -- our wafer capacity for both DRAM and NAND wafer output capacity was approaching 30% below our prior peak levels as we began this fiscal year. And the majority of that was underutilization of equipment. And as we transition through the year, and as Mark noted earlier, we'll be utilizing some of that underutilized equipment towards transitioning to the leading-edge nodes, 1-beta and 232-layer NAND. And as we do that throughout the year, by the time we exit fiscal year or beginning of the next fiscal year, fiscal '25, the majority of that reduction will be actually the derated capacity or reduction in capacity due to the longer process cycle times and the equipment being utilized for more complex nodes. We haven't really -- and the production capacity will be down meaningfully from our peak levels, but we haven't really given specifics on how much it'll just be meaningfully down even as a result of this. And we still will have some underutilization primarily on legacy nodes going through into fiscal '25 as well."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', 'Got it. And the NAND side, very similar or?', 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""I'm sorry, that was -- those were all about DRAM and comments, yes. By the beginning of '25..."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', 'Sorry, go ahead.', 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""No, I was going to say, by even '25, we would expect that the majority of the reduction in capacity came from converting equipment to the newer nodes versus a decision we've taken on underutilizing and idling equipment."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', ""And then on the HBM side, any similar commentary on what your capacity would be on HBM within DRAM, I guess, exiting fiscal '23 versus fiscal '24 or fiscal '25?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""We haven't provided much detail other than to say that we expect our share of HBM to intercept our share of the overall DRAM market sometime in calendar year '25. So that gives you some sense of sort of where we have to go. As you know, we have not had as large a share. So we're starting from a trailing position. We had some capacity and some production on HBM2E to get good learning, but the HBM3E will be a steep ramp. We have good alignment agreement with the equipment suppliers, and we have a plan to be able to meet several hundred million dollars of revenue within fiscal year '24, which I think we talked about in the script. And then, of course, that will position us well to be able to grow continuing into fiscal year '25 towards that goal of being able to intercept our overall industry market share sometime in calendar year '25."", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""And Vijay, maybe I'll add just maybe a CapEx-related comment on profile. So we gave an estimate $7.5 billion to $8 billion CapEx, based on the guidance we gave for the first half CapEx and the second half CapEx will be a bit higher than the first half, and that's a function of HBM spend and also greenfield capacity spend. Certainly, we've made some grant assumptions on size and timing. And of course, that's reflected in our guidance. So if that were to change materially, then it may affect our numbers, both CapEx and cash flow."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""Right. And just a slight clarification about greenfield capacity, but it's really greenfield facilities to support future capacity."", 'Mark J. Murphy', 'Yes, end of decade related demand.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.', 'Shek Ming Ho', 'Just a follow-up to a couple of questions from the last two questions. What was the idle charges in fiscal Q1? And what are you baking in for fiscal Q2 in your gross margin guidance? And why would idle charges come down when bit shipment is expected to decline somewhat in fiscal Q2 and again in Q3? Is it just the use of underutilized equipment for those transition that you guys just talked about?', 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Yes. So Sidney, the idle charges in Q1 were $165 million. So that's down from over $220 million in the fourth quarter. They'll go down significantly first quarter to second quarter. And again, this is a function of utilization is going up in the network and underutilization is going to largely reside in legacy nodes. And again, as we talked about last call and this call, that's happening in part because the -- we've redeployed some legacy node equipment to leading nodes and the actual -- the wafer output is down. So the denominator in the utilization is larger -- or smaller. So again, the idle charges are related to when utilization is under a certain level you cannot capitalize those costs in inventory. So since utilization is increasing, we pass that level for leading node and have idle charges remaining to lagging nodes."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""And maybe, Sidney, just a little follow-up on the second part of your question on bit shipments and timing of bit shipments. Keep in mind, the process cycle time in fab as we transition to these newer nodes is longer, so the cycle time in the fab is longer, right, as we make these transitions, so you're converting to a node, more complex, better technology, but it is longer cycle time in the fab. And then we're also, and Mark mentioned, particularly for NAND, transitioning and targeting our portfolio towards higher value solutions, those high-value solutions also have longer cycle time in assembly and test. So sort of the -- that's why when we say we're constrained on leading-edge nodes, it's not immediately when you're talking about leading-edge technology into leading-edge, high-value products, it's the cycle time for us to be able to deliver more bit shipments is longer than maybe it was last year when we had more of a component focus."", 'Shek Ming Ho', ""That's super helpful. Maybe my follow-up question is, if I look at DRAM ASP, it was up slightly in fiscal Q1. That's kind of expected. I think previously, you said it was limited by customer, strategic buys occurred in prior quarters. Is there any way you can help us think what would have been -- what gross margin would have been without the headwind from these strategic buys. And if you look at fiscal 2Q, part of the quarter is still within that -- we'll probably see the same headwind, right, because most of these pre-buys have been ended at the end of the calendar year. Is it fair that there will be another step-up in fiscal Q3 that is above and beyond market trends that would you be thinking about?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. So yes, I mean, it is true that fiscal Q1 did get impacted by some strategic buys in terms of pricing realized, but keep in mind that those strategic buys were implemented or agreed upon in CQ3. And further, FQ1 has the effect of September in there, which is part of CQ3 pricing, which was still under pressure. And then 2 months of CQ4, where we did better. The other aspect was we came into FQ1 with robust bookings even beyond the strategic buys and these robust bookings included pricing that had been negotiated earlier before the inflection happened. So we knew based on those robust bookings, we were able to then use those robust bookings to push pricing higher than we had originally expected. And so CQ4 pricing ended up becoming much better than we had originally planned because of that. And of course, you're seeing that our FQ2 guidance on revenue is going up substantially from $4.7 billion in FQ1 to $5.3 billion plus/minus $200 million without the benefit of bit growth, right, because bit growth is not a driver in those numbers. And yes, December is 1 month of CQ4 in our FQ2. And then we'll have 2 months of CQ1 in there in our FQ2, January and February. But all of the expectation that we have right now is for continued increases in pricing. So for a lot of the customers for whom we do pricing negotiations on a calendar quarter basis. Every fiscal quarter, we'll have this effect of 1 month previous quarter, 2 months next quarter, and that's how it will flow into our P&L."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.', 'Vivek Arya', ""I had two as well. The first one on just the concept of the pricing improvement. Historically, the memory industry has had a challenging time forecasting pricing for more than 1-plus quarter, but now you're suggesting pricing can continue to improve, not just in the current quarter, but I think I heard for 2 more quarters. And the main reason I heard was tightness in leading edge, which I assume you mean your supply tightness in leading edge. So if you could just give us more color, what's giving you the visibility that pricing can continue to improve for several quarters because when I think of leading edge, I'm reminded of the data center, but that's the segment you are saying is most oversupplied at least in the near term. So just help us understand what is helping drive that confidence and visibility that pricing can continue to improve for several quarters."", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. I think the pricing outlook we can think of from 2 angles. One is the demand side and one is the supply side. I think on the supply side, you have seen that the industry has had a challenging time with margins and so many announced CapEx cuts underutilization, et cetera. So the supply has been impacted quite a bit. We have also spoken in our last earnings call as well as in this current earnings call about how underutilization is going to morph into lower capacity. And so the overall capacity is getting impacted by all of these capital-efficient approaches to moving tools from the underutilized older nodes to newer nodes. And so we have constrained capacity overall. And then, of course, HBM ramp that is taking place in the industry, we have mentioned to you the more than 2:1 trade ratio if we manufacture one bit of HBM based on the end-to-end yields, we end up with more than 2 bps loss DDR5 in the process. So all of those things are pressuring supply. And when you get to a lower amount of overall capacity, and then you decide at some point that the ROI justifies increasing CapEx, you obviously have to first reach that point where you can justify increasing CapEx. From that point, you have 2 lead times and then you have all of the cycle time of the front end and back end, which typically is 4.5 to 5 months, depending on the complexity of the product, that cycle time. So tool cycle time, let's say, scanners and so on, 9 months, 5 months for fab front end and back end. You're at 14 months before output can be impacted once capacity needs to be increased. So it's a long cycle time to increase capacity and get those bits in the hands of customers and in terms of products that they need. So there is that supply time line and supply impacts that are happening in the industry. On the demand side, we have mentioned multiple drivers in our earnings call and other public comments about what's driving the demand in the short term. We have normalized inventory in smartphones and PCs, auto and industrial continue to grow robustly from a big demand perspective. So these things are helping drive -- and of course, the average capacity increase is happening across the board. So these things are driving big demand. And yes, you're right, the data center is certainly not yet normalized in terms of inventory. But keep in mind that data center is not the only user of leading-edge technology products. These -- for example, when we think about smartphones and when we think about PCs, they all use leading-edge technology. We have spoken about DDR5 transition from DDR4. Most of our DDR5 is in leading-edge nodes. And so that's one example. All of our clients and data center SSDs, we have mentioned how we have reached the second consecutive record in data center SSD. That's all leading-edge nodes. And so it's not just the data center that is using leading-edge nodes. It's also multiple other parts of the market. And then you're right, we don't usually forecast pricing this time around. We did talk about our expectation of pricing increasing throughout calendar '24. I mentioned the supply side of it. The other aspect is we are seeing this tightness in leading edge even before data center has become a material purchaser of DRAM and NAND, they are still in inventory consumption mode. So their purchases of DRAM and NAND are still below their consumption, right? So they're consuming DRAM and NAND from inventory more. And so once their inventory normalizes, they will become a more active purchaser of DRAM and NAND in the second half. So some are starting in sometime first half and certainly second half of calendar 2024. So that will become an additional driver. And all of our 2024 numbers don't require very dramatic growth in DC units or smartphone units or even general purpose server units. Our growth expectations are all very modest in these areas. So any kind of uptick especially later in calendar '24 will just add to demand in an environment where supply is not easy to come about in this time frame, given this time line I mentioned on when supply can be added. So the last point I will mention is this has been a very unusual decline for the whole industry. Certainly most challenging in 15 years, but unusual in the aftermath of the COVID upswing that happened, which needed to be worked off, et cetera. So there has been an impact to industry balance sheet. There has been an impact to the overall ROI. And certainly, from a Micron perspective, we are going to be very focused on ensuring supply discipline, ensuring we invest based on improving ROI and ensuring we do think very carefully about supply-demand balance and how we make our own plans. So when I put all of these factors together, that's what gives us confidence about a little bit more extended time line where we provided our guidance in view of our expectation of pricing strengthening throughout 2024."", 'Vivek Arya', ""Very helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, actually, two clarifications for Mark. So one is on the chips grant, what has been contemplated for many other companies, it's about 10%, 20% of CapEx. So that suggests gross CapEx could be higher next year, right? And I don't know whether that means if WFE will also be higher on a gross basis, even on a net basis maybe, so I don't know if there's any issue there.

Maybe you mentioned where perhaps I didn't catch it before."", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Yes.

We've made assumptions, as I mentioned earlier about grant timing and size based on our understanding of potential there, but nothing else to disclose at this time. On drivers of gross margin expansion through the year, it's going to be -- we didn't provide any color other than it will expand, We believe, through the year, second to third and third to fourth. That will be almost exclusively priced in the second to third. There will be some net cost benefit. So that will be a bit muted because we will lose that lower cost inventory benefit, which we -- that inventory last clears in the second quarter. And then in the -- and then we'll see price appreciation again, and that will be the largest factor again in the fourth quarter gross margin expansion."", 'Operator', ""And this does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program.

That compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.99 billion. Excluding certain items, Micron will have a loss of 21 cents to 35 cents — narrower than the 62 cents projected by analysts.', 'Shares rose to $83.29 early in New York after closing at $78.69. They had been up 57% this year — in line with broader gains for chip equities — driven by investor optimism that an inventory glut is easing.', 'The outlook signals that Micron is through the worse of an industrywide slump and moving back toward profitability. The boom in artificial intelligence spending is helping. Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra has pointed to strong demand for the expensive memory used in data centers to help develop AI software.', 'Mehrotra also repeated his prediction that 2024 will be a rebound year for the industry, setting the stage for record results in 2025. But the company will wait to boost chip output until prices improve, he said.', 'The company has already sold out of all of the high-bandwidth memory that it can make in 2024, Mehrotra said. That’s the type of ultrafast-access chips needed by computers that are creating AI software. That “high-revenue, high-profit opportunity for the industry” has just gotten underway, he said.', 'Micron is trying to recover from a year of smartphone and PC makers slashing orders. The customers built up an oversupply of inventory, sending memory prices plummeting below the cost of production.', 'Micron now expects PC unit volumes to grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits in calendar 2024, following two years of declines. Smartphone demand also is showing signs of recovery, the company said, and will “grow modestly” in 2024.', 'Read More: Dell Sales Miss Estimates With Corporate PCs Still Lagging', 'While demand isn’t roaring back in those areas, customers have at least worked through excess inventory, Mehrotra said. That’s helped restore the supply-and-demand balance, he said. “It strengthens pricing.”', 'In the fiscal first quarter, which ended Nov. 30, Micron’s revenue rose 16% to $4.73 billion. The Boise, Idaho-based company had a loss of 95 cents a share, excluding certain items. That compares with estimated sales of $4.54 billion and a loss of $1 a share.', 'Micron gave a preview of the results late this month, warning that its operating costs have grown. The report disappointed investors, who sent the shares sliding at the time.', 'Micron became the largest US maker of memory chips by acquiring rivals and surviving several brutal downturns in the industry. It competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. in selling the chips, which provide short-term memory in computers and phones. Micron also makes flash memory, which provides longer-term storage in those devices.', 'Both types of memory follow industry standards, meaning that parts from different companies are interchangeable and can be traded like commodities. The downside is that prices can be volatile, and customers can switch from one supplier to another.', 'Memory-chip makers have been trying to push into new markets, such as data centers, cars and an increasing array of gadgets — making them less dependent on phones and PCs.

While there were concerns that the high-interest rates would plunge the economy into recession, that has not been the case. A solid labor market and solid economic data depict the economy's resilience. However, the high-interest rate environment threatens to disrupt dividend-paying stock returns."", 'The high-interest rates in play, following the Fed hikes, translate to increased interest payments whenever companies borrow or raise capital through bonds, loans and convertible debt. The net result is an increase in interest expense that reduces companies’ earnings used to pay dividends.', ""When earnings decline due to extra expenses attributed to higher interest rates, one or two things might happen. The stock value might fall to adjust for the reduction in earnings. Secondly, the valuation multiples might rise as investors are forced to pay more for fewer future earnings. While higher valuation might help prop the stock's price in the short term, it may lead to higher volatility."", 'Professional investors sometimes turn to defensive dividend-paying stocks in a high-interest rate environment where earnings are constantly under pressure. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, always focuses on companies with solid fundamentals and competitive advantages. Such companies are the only ones capable of sustaining and increasing their dividends regardless of the prevailing macroeconomics.', ""While most investors focus on stocks offering high dividend yields, Buffett advocates for stocks with moderate yields from strong and prosperous companies. As of the end of the second quarter, most of the stocks in Buffett's portfolio were companies with a solid and long track record of increasing and paying dividends."", ""According to the legendary investor, the value of any dividend stock depends on the company's ability to generate earnings today and tomorrow. To identify such a company, investors ought to investigate the company's dividend history. It's the only way to identify companies with a solid track record of consistently increasing earnings, allowing them to pay dividends over at least five years."", 'It is a strategy that the legendary investor has perfected over the years going by his investments in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway, the holding firm that Buffett uses to invest in the equity markets, has seen its share of earnings through dividends in the beverage giant grow from\xa0$75 million in 1994 to $704 million\xa0as of 2022. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has also proved to be a successful investment for Buffett, with dividend returns having grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million as of last year.', ""Beyond earnings and profits that companies use to pay dividends, Buffett advocates for paying close watch to companies' revenues and cash flow\xa0growth rates. Such metrics provide valuable information on how a company operates and whether it can sustain its dividend program."", ""In some cases, a company's earnings used in paying dividends might be higher due to increased cuts in expenses rather than underlying revenue growth. However, if revenues are increasing, it means the company's core business is growing steadily to generate much-needed earnings for dividends."", ""Cash flow is another critical metric that Buffett pays close watch to as it represents the amount of money available to finance various operations. Any company with negative cash flow cannot continue operating for long and won't be able to pay any dividends."", ""The best dividend stocks have consistently proven their worth regardless of the prevailing market conditions. The stocks have played a significant role in affirming the S&P 500 returns over the years. The S&P 500 rose by about 777% between 1993 and the end of 2022. Including dividends, the index rose by about 1400%. In this case, dividends accounted for about 20% of the market's total return."", 'According to Buffett, investors should strive to invest in companies with a strong dividend history rather than investing in the overall stock market. Likewise, he constantly advocates for value stocks priced lower than their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have yielded a return of 626,000% since 1926, value stocks have generated\xa0a total return of 1,344,600%\xa0over the same period.', 'Amid the high inflation period in 2022, value stocks remained resilient, only going down by 7%. In contrast, growth stocks that some investors turn to because of their high dividend yield went down by about 28%.', 'Value stocks have not performed well as growth stocks in 2023, as depicted by the Russell 3000 Growth Index, beating its counterpart by 22%. Nevertheless, the stocks are expected to bounce back as their performance remains better in the long run.', ""Value stocks trading at discounted valuations have also proved their worth regarding dividend payouts. Given that the companies grow gradually and remain resilient amid challenging macroeconomics, they also tend to increase their dividend payouts gradually. Chevron is one such company in Buffett's portfolio that has increased its dividends for 36 years."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett's skillful stock-picking for passive income is evident as Berkshire Hathaway is anticipated to accumulate over $6 billion in dividend income in the upcoming year.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.

If you want to skip our discussion on the US housing market, you can go directly to the 5 Cities Where Home Prices Are Falling Now.', 'The US housing market is experiencing yet another turn as affordability is dampening demand for houses in the country. Data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) showed that home affordability is currently at the lowest level since 1985. It also revealed that during Q3 2023, the median house price in the US rose by 2.2% as compared to the same period last year. This occurred after Q2 of 2022 witnessed a 2.4% decline in the median price of homes on a yearly basis. Overall, home prices rose in 82% of the housing markets tracked by NAR, with 11% of the markets experiencing double-digit increases in prices during Q3 2023.', 'Homeowners’ and buyers’ woes have further deepened as mortgage rates climbed to the highest level in the last 23 years. The 30-year mortgage rate ranged from 6.81% to 7.1% during the third quarter of 2023. The rise in mortgage rates has resulted from moves by The Federal Reserve to reduce soaring inflation rates. The monthly mortgage payment for an average single-family home with a 20% down payment increased by 19.2% during this period as compared to Q3 2022. About 27% of a typical family’s monthly income is spent on mortgage payments due to such a high rate.\xa0 Therefore, with the current interest rate, a six-figure income is needed to afford mortgage payments in more than half the housing markets within the US.', 'The increase in housing prices has made the situation quite unfavorable for potential home buyers. However, home buyers don’t need to lose hope, as there are still a few metropolitan cities that actually experienced a decline in housing prices year-on-year (YoY) during the third quarter of 2023. The decline in prices does not indicate a real estate market crash in these cities but rather a period of slowdown. Most of these markets witnessed a boom during the pandemic and are now undergoing correction. This trend was witnessed in 38 housing markets throughout the US. Out of these, 25 have witnessed more than 1% decline in housing prices as compared to last year.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.', 'Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.', 'One stock to keep an eye on is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.', ""Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.29. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 3.40. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.16."", ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 3.13. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 4.82. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.20 and as low as 2.58, with a median of 2.87, over the past year."", ""Finally, investors will want to recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.08. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PCAR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 19.13. Within the past 12 months, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 9.90."", ""These are just a handful of the figures considered in PACCAR's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

However, due to timely interventions by the central bank, and considering the resilient nature of the US market, experts are now predicting that the worst may be behind the US and the economy is on a much better footing heading into the new year compared to last year. A lot of numbers back this point of view. For example, the US economy grew nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2023.\xa0\xa0', 'This was the fastest growth pace for the economy in nearly two years. Higher wages from the tight labor market actually fueled a rise in consumer spending, forcing large businesses to restock to meet increasing demand. Latest data from the US government indicates that retail sales registered a modest increase in November despite predictions of a slump. Deep discounting helped the holiday season get off to a brisk start, per reports. The markets were further buoyed by indications of stable interest rates for the coming months.\xa0', 'Kathy Bostjancic, the chief of financial services firm Nationwide, told news agency Reuters that there was a chance that the central could achieve a soft landing. She noted that the resilience of the consumer provided credibility to the Fed achieving a soft landing, but should also be a signal to markets that the Fed was not likely to cut rates as quickly and as much as the markets now had priced in. Bostjancic added that the stronger economic activity remained, the slower inflation would decline, and the slower the Fed would respond with rate cuts.', 'Some of the risks that investors should continue to monitor heading into 2024 include inflation and elevated interest rates. Although inflation is on the decline, it reached a high of over 9% for the first time in four decades in the summer of 2022. As of November 2023, inflation numbers are around 3%. The decision of the central bank to raise interest rates to highs not seen in two decades was aggressive but appears to have paid off.

If you want to skip our overview of the dividend stocks and the latest news, then you can take a look at\xa0the 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett.', ""The US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% has been the catalyst behind inflationary pressures plunging from highs of 9.1% to about 3.1% as of November. While there were concerns that the high-interest rates would plunge the economy into recession, that has not been the case. A solid labor market and solid economic data depict the economy's resilience. However, the high-interest rate environment threatens to disrupt dividend-paying stock returns."", 'The high-interest rates in play, following the Fed hikes, translate to increased interest payments whenever companies borrow or raise capital through bonds, loans and convertible debt. The net result is an increase in interest expense that reduces companies’ earnings used to pay dividends.', ""When earnings decline due to extra expenses attributed to higher interest rates, one or two things might happen. The stock value might fall to adjust for the reduction in earnings. Secondly, the valuation multiples might rise as investors are forced to pay more for fewer future earnings. While higher valuation might help prop the stock's price in the short term, it may lead to higher volatility."", 'Professional investors sometimes turn to defensive dividend-paying stocks in a high-interest rate environment where earnings are constantly under pressure. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, always focuses on companies with solid fundamentals and competitive advantages. Such companies are the only ones capable of sustaining and increasing their dividends regardless of the prevailing macroeconomics.', ""While most investors focus on stocks offering high dividend yields, Buffett advocates for stocks with moderate yields from strong and prosperous companies. As of the end of the second quarter, most of the stocks in Buffett's portfolio were companies with a solid and long track record of increasing and paying dividends."", ""According to the legendary investor, the value of any dividend stock depends on the company's ability to generate earnings today and tomorrow. To identify such a company, investors ought to investigate the company's dividend history. It's the only way to identify companies with a solid track record of consistently increasing earnings, allowing them to pay dividends over at least five years."", 'It is a strategy that the legendary investor has perfected over the years going by his investments in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway, the holding firm that Buffett uses to invest in the equity markets, has seen its share of earnings through dividends in the beverage giant grow from\xa0$75 million in 1994 to $704 million\xa0as of 2022. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has also proved to be a successful investment for Buffett, with dividend returns having grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million as of last year.', ""Beyond earnings and profits that companies use to pay dividends, Buffett advocates for paying close watch to companies' revenues and cash flow\xa0growth rates. Such metrics provide valuable information on how a company operates and whether it can sustain its dividend program."", ""In some cases, a company's earnings used in paying dividends might be higher due to increased cuts in expenses rather than underlying revenue growth.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.

If you want to skip our overview of the dividend stocks and the latest news, then you can take a look at\xa0the 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett.', ""The US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% has been the catalyst behind inflationary pressures plunging from highs of 9.1% to about 3.1% as of November. While there were concerns that the high-interest rates would plunge the economy into recession, that has not been the case. A solid labor market and solid economic data depict the economy's resilience. However, the high-interest rate environment threatens to disrupt dividend-paying stock returns."", 'The high-interest rates in play, following the Fed hikes, translate to increased interest payments whenever companies borrow or raise capital through bonds, loans and convertible debt. The net result is an increase in interest expense that reduces companies’ earnings used to pay dividends.', ""When earnings decline due to extra expenses attributed to higher interest rates, one or two things might happen. The stock value might fall to adjust for the reduction in earnings. Secondly, the valuation multiples might rise as investors are forced to pay more for fewer future earnings. While higher valuation might help prop the stock's price in the short term, it may lead to higher volatility."", 'Professional investors sometimes turn to defensive dividend-paying stocks in a high-interest rate environment where earnings are constantly under pressure. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, always focuses on companies with solid fundamentals and competitive advantages. Such companies are the only ones capable of sustaining and increasing their dividends regardless of the prevailing macroeconomics.', ""While most investors focus on stocks offering high dividend yields, Buffett advocates for stocks with moderate yields from strong and prosperous companies. As of the end of the second quarter, most of the stocks in Buffett's portfolio were companies with a solid and long track record of increasing and paying dividends."", ""According to the legendary investor, the value of any dividend stock depends on the company's ability to generate earnings today and tomorrow. To identify such a company, investors ought to investigate the company's dividend history. It's the only way to identify companies with a solid track record of consistently increasing earnings, allowing them to pay dividends over at least five years."", 'It is a strategy that the legendary investor has perfected over the years going by his investments in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway, the holding firm that Buffett uses to invest in the equity markets, has seen its share of earnings through dividends in the beverage giant grow from\xa0$75 million in 1994 to $704 million\xa0as of 2022. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has also proved to be a successful investment for Buffett, with dividend returns having grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million as of last year.', ""Beyond earnings and profits that companies use to pay dividends, Buffett advocates for paying close watch to companies' revenues and cash flow\xa0growth rates. Such metrics provide valuable information on how a company operates and whether it can sustain its dividend program."", ""In some cases, a company's earnings used in paying dividends might be higher due to increased cuts in expenses rather than underlying revenue growth. However, if revenues are increasing, it means the company's core business is growing steadily to generate much-needed earnings for dividends."", ""Cash flow is another critical metric that Buffett pays close watch to as it represents the amount of money available to finance various operations. Any company with negative cash flow cannot continue operating for long and won't be able to pay any dividends."", ""The best dividend stocks have consistently proven their worth regardless of the prevailing market conditions. The stocks have played a significant role in affirming the S&P 500 returns over the years. The S&P 500 rose by about 777% between 1993 and the end of 2022. Including dividends, the index rose by about 1400%. In this case, dividends accounted for about 20% of the market's total return."", 'According to Buffett, investors should strive to invest in companies with a strong dividend history rather than investing in the overall stock market. Likewise, he constantly advocates for value stocks priced lower than their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have yielded a return of 626,000% since 1926, value stocks have generated\xa0a total return of 1,344,600%\xa0over the same period.', 'Amid the high inflation period in 2022, value stocks remained resilient, only going down by 7%. In contrast, growth stocks that some investors turn to because of their high dividend yield went down by about 28%.', 'Value stocks have not performed well as growth stocks in 2023, as depicted by the Russell 3000 Growth Index, beating its counterpart by 22%. Nevertheless, the stocks are expected to bounce back as their performance remains better in the long run.', ""Value stocks trading at discounted valuations have also proved their worth regarding dividend payouts. Given that the companies grow gradually and remain resilient amid challenging macroeconomics, they also tend to increase their dividend payouts gradually. Chevron is one such company in Buffett's portfolio that has increased its dividends for 36 years."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett's skillful stock-picking for passive income is evident as Berkshire Hathaway is anticipated to accumulate over $6 billion in dividend income in the upcoming year. Our examination of Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filings led us to identify top-performing stocks with consistent dividend payouts. The selected stocks are part of Berkshire Hathaway's Q3 2023 13F portfolio, and we specifically focused on those companies that regularly distribute dividends to their shareholders.

(NYSE:KR), reflecting a slight reduction from the 43 in the preceding quarter.\xa0"", 'In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Funds featured insights on The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR). The firm expressed the following perspective:', '“The Kroger Co.\xa0(NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

Despite the broader market's significant gains, the energy sector saw a decline in value. However, analysts suggest a more favorable outlook for 2024. For example, Maurice Fitzmaurice, a sector portfolio manager at Fidelity, expresses optimism:"", '""While energy stocks have had a slow 2023, I believe 2024 could be bright. Crude oil prices are likely to remain elevated in 2024 – driven by tight supply, increased geopolitical risk, and strengthening global demand for energy. This could set up a positive backdrop for profitability, and potentially stock prices, in the sector.""', 'U.S. crude oil experienced a 3% increase on December 14, building on the gains from the previous session, attributed to a marginally improved global demand outlook for 2024 and a weaker dollar.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve alleviated traders' concerns by acknowledging progress in taming inflation. The central bank signaled three rate cuts for 2024, potentially positively impacting oil demand next year, as higher interest rates tend to slow economic growth, putting downward pressure on crude prices."", 'Conversely, in the long run, the IEA foresees a 25% reduction in fossil fuel demand by 2030 and an 80% decrease by 2050.

If you want to skip our overview of the dividend stocks and the latest news, then you can take a look at\xa0the 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett.', ""The US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% has been the catalyst behind inflationary pressures plunging from highs of 9.1% to about 3.1% as of November. While there were concerns that the high-interest rates would plunge the economy into recession, that has not been the case. A solid labor market and solid economic data depict the economy's resilience. However, the high-interest rate environment threatens to disrupt dividend-paying stock returns."", 'The high-interest rates in play, following the Fed hikes, translate to increased interest payments whenever companies borrow or raise capital through bonds, loans and convertible debt. The net result is an increase in interest expense that reduces companies’ earnings used to pay dividends.', ""When earnings decline due to extra expenses attributed to higher interest rates, one or two things might happen. The stock value might fall to adjust for the reduction in earnings. Secondly, the valuation multiples might rise as investors are forced to pay more for fewer future earnings. While higher valuation might help prop the stock's price in the short term, it may lead to higher volatility."", 'Professional investors sometimes turn to defensive dividend-paying stocks in a high-interest rate environment where earnings are constantly under pressure. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, always focuses on companies with solid fundamentals and competitive advantages. Such companies are the only ones capable of sustaining and increasing their dividends regardless of the prevailing macroeconomics.', ""While most investors focus on stocks offering high dividend yields, Buffett advocates for stocks with moderate yields from strong and prosperous companies. As of the end of the second quarter, most of the stocks in Buffett's portfolio were companies with a solid and long track record of increasing and paying dividends."", ""According to the legendary investor, the value of any dividend stock depends on the company's ability to generate earnings today and tomorrow. To identify such a company, investors ought to investigate the company's dividend history. It's the only way to identify companies with a solid track record of consistently increasing earnings, allowing them to pay dividends over at least five years."", 'It is a strategy that the legendary investor has perfected over the years going by his investments in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway, the holding firm that Buffett uses to invest in the equity markets, has seen its share of earnings through dividends in the beverage giant grow from\xa0$75 million in 1994 to $704 million\xa0as of 2022. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has also proved to be a successful investment for Buffett, with dividend returns having grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million as of last year.', ""Beyond earnings and profits that companies use to pay dividends, Buffett advocates for paying close watch to companies' revenues and cash flow\xa0growth rates. Such metrics provide valuable information on how a company operates and whether it can sustain its dividend program."", ""In some cases, a company's earnings used in paying dividends might be higher due to increased cuts in expenses rather than underlying revenue growth. However, if revenues are increasing, it means the company's core business is growing steadily to generate much-needed earnings for dividends."", ""Cash flow is another critical metric that Buffett pays close watch to as it represents the amount of money available to finance various operations. Any company with negative cash flow cannot continue operating for long and won't be able to pay any dividends."", ""The best dividend stocks have consistently proven their worth regardless of the prevailing market conditions. The stocks have played a significant role in affirming the S&P 500 returns over the years. The S&P 500 rose by about 777% between 1993 and the end of 2022. Including dividends, the index rose by about 1400%. In this case, dividends accounted for about 20% of the market's total return."", 'According to Buffett, investors should strive to invest in companies with a strong dividend history rather than investing in the overall stock market. Likewise, he constantly advocates for value stocks priced lower than their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have yielded a return of 626,000% since 1926, value stocks have generated\xa0a total return of 1,344,600%\xa0over the same period.', 'Amid the high inflation period in 2022, value stocks remained resilient, only going down by 7%. In contrast, growth stocks that some investors turn to because of their high dividend yield went down by about 28%.', 'Value stocks have not performed well as growth stocks in 2023, as depicted by the Russell 3000 Growth Index, beating its counterpart by 22%. Nevertheless, the stocks are expected to bounce back as their performance remains better in the long run.', ""Value stocks trading at discounted valuations have also proved their worth regarding dividend payouts. Given that the companies grow gradually and remain resilient amid challenging macroeconomics, they also tend to increase their dividend payouts gradually. Chevron is one such company in Buffett's portfolio that has increased its dividends for 36 years."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett's skillful stock-picking for passive income is evident as Berkshire Hathaway is anticipated to accumulate over $6 billion in dividend income in the upcoming year. Our examination of Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filings led us to identify top-performing stocks with consistent dividend payouts.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.

And along with partner CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex recently won approval for another potential blockbuster -- this time, a gene-editing treatment for blood disorders.', ""These programs are significant and should help Vertex continue to boost revenue over time. But the opportunities don't stop there."", ""Vertex also is working on a candidate that addresses one of the world's most common problems: pain. The company is wrapping up a pivotal program now and expects to report data early next year. Could this potential product be a gold mine for Vertex?"", ""First, let's take a quick look at the pain market. At first glance, it may seem saturated with products, from over-the-counter ones like acetaminophen to prescription opioid painkillers. But there are a few problems with today's options. For example, some of the nonprescription options lack efficacy for severe pain, and have side effects like liver toxicity. And opioids come with the very big problem of addiction risk. This means the pain market actually doesn't offer patients a lot of options, so a new drug could be just what the doctor ordered."", ""The advantage of Vertex's VX-548 is that it offers efficacy but without the side effects associated with other painkillers. This non-opioid pain candidate works by inhibiting the activity of a sodium channel that plays a key role in pain signaling."", 'We all know that there are many types of pain -- and it can range from minor to severe. With VX-548, Vertex has zeroed in on two areas that offer it a wide market opportunity: acute pain and neuropathic pain. Acute pain is the sort caused by injury or surgery, while neuropathic is nerve pain, which may be linked to a variety of health conditions.', 'Every year in the U.S., more than 90 million patients seek treatment for acute or peripheral neuropathic pain -- so the markets are huge.', ""Acute pain, a $4 billion market, represents a near-term launch opportunity for Vertex, and a few elements should work in the company's favor. First, two-thirds of prescribing volume is concentrated in hospitals -- and most of it within about 2,000 hospitals. With a specialty sales force, Vertex should be able to specifically connect with prescribers and inform them about the new product if it's approved."", 'Second, prescribers are likely to be receptive since many hospitals have implemented policies to limit opioid prescribing -- so doctors are in need of options for their patients. Finally, legislation -- the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) Act -- boosts patient access to non-opioid options by requiring separate Medicare reimbursements for them. So, hospitals and doctors are encouraged to go for non-opioid options, something that clearly could help Vertex gain market share.', ""The company initially is seeking a label for moderate to severe acute pain, a broad label that should allow prescribing across multiple healthcare settings. This will be based on VX-548's phase 3 data, to be released in the coming months as mentioned above."", ""Vertex is also studying VX-548 in various types of neuropathic pain, and recently reported positive phase 2 data in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The company plans to advance into pivotal trials for this indication, and it's recently launched a phase 2 study in another type of nerve pain -- lumbosacral radiculopathy."", ""Let's get back to our question: Could this potential pain drug be a gold mine for Vertex? It's important to note that Vertex's core CF portfolio remains a huge growth driver -- and that's likely to continue. Thanks to its solid innovations and patents, Vertex could dominate this market through at least the late 2030s. Last year, these products generated $8.9 billion in revenue."", ""It's too early to say whether the pain market will generate the same levels of revenue -- or even more. Still, I think it's fair to say this new market does represent a gold mine -- certainly a blockbuster opportunity -- thanks to the pervasiveness of pain, the limited treatment options today, and VX-548's performance so far. Also, if the candidate wins regulatory approval, Vertex has the commercial expertise and infrastructure to support product uptake."", ""So, what does this mean for you? Vertex shares have climbed over time, and this year they've gained about 40%. But Vertex has what it takes to spur performance down the road too, thanks to the pain program and its CF portfolio. And that's why Vertex is a great biotech stock to buy today and hold onto for the long term."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you want to skip our take on how the gene editing industry sits right at the top of the global innovation food chain, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks. ', 'In the old days, alchemists were described as chemists who could turn lead into gold. A process undoubtedly perceived as magic, it offered dreamers a chance to untold riches by simply converting a low value metal into a high value asset. While modern day technology has still to convert anything into gold, it has also provided us with a slew of technologies that can comfortably lay the claim to being magical.', ""One such technology is the ability to manipulate genes. Genes are the 'software code' of the human body and they determine how tall we are, what color our eyes are, and when we'll start to lose our hair. At the same time, in a rather cruel demonstration of the human condition, they also determine if someone will get a deadly disease. Genetic disorders are some of the most debilitating diseases known to humans. Some examples of these diseases are Sickle Cell Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Brugada Syndrome. Among these, Sickle Cell Disease prevents patients, including children, from living their lives fully as their body cannot transport oxygen internally to lead to healthy functioning. People who suffer from Huntington's Disease target the human mind, making brain cells called neurons break down. If a sufficient number of neurons are significantly damaged, then patients, either children or adults, lose their ability to normally function."", ""Additionally, genetic diseases and their patients suffer from the additional complication of a lack of treatment options. Viral and bacterial infections such as the coronavirus or pneumonia can be treated by medicine that targets the invading pathogens. However, genetic diseases result from 'bugs' in the human body's software, so unless portions of this software are rewritten, the disease continues to wreak havoc. This re coding is at the heart of the genomic editing industry, and within its ambit is genetic engineering, a science that introduces new genetic material into the body."", ""This industry's potential also makes it quite lucrative. For instance, market research shows that the global genomics industry was worth $27.58 billion in 2021 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% until 2026 for a final value of $63.5 billion. If you're interested in knowing more about genomics, which is pure play gene editing, then you can check out 12 Best Genomics Stocks To Buy Now."", ""Shifting gears to see what's happening in the gene editing industry, the market is booming. In fact, December 2023 might be one of the most important months in the gene editing industry. This is because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two treatments for Sickle Cell Disease. These are developed through a partnership between Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) and by bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLUE). The Vertex+CRISPR treatment is the first of its kind that is developed through the CRISPR gene editing technology, and it marks a turn for the industry as it is one of the first genetic editing treatments that can be commercialized."", ""Of course, rewriting the human body's software is quite difficult. You can't use Python to do it, which makes such treatments among the costliest in the world. The Sickle Cell treatments from CRISPR+Vertex and bluebird cost an eye watering $2.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. While they are one time treatments, this price naturally will exclude most patients due to the high sticker price. Additionally, while they are cutting edge medical treatments, Sickle Cell medicine comes with its own side effects. According to the FDA, bluebird's treatment called Lyfgenia can cause blood cancer among patients - in a worrying example of from the frying pan into the fire."", 'So, as gene editing continues to make history, we decided to take a look at some of the most promising gene editing stocks according to analysts.

The soft drink giant's sales took a harder hit from the COVID-19 crisis than archrival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), since Pepsi's large portfolio of snack foods softened that company's fall. Some bearish investors argue that Pepsi's more diverse product mix is a healthier business platform than Coca-Cola's sharp focus on various beverages. As a result, Coke's stock has lagged behind Pepsi in the coronavirus era."", ""But that's not the whole story. Despite its skinnier revenue streams, Coca-Cola's leaner business model generates far wider profit margins and free cash flows in the end.

For one, the conversion of in-house operations to outsourced partnerships continues. The company recently sold its Philippine operations to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners\xa0and a private equity firm, for example.

This is aptly illustrated by the fact that the US economy has grown by around 5.4% since the COVID-19 pandemic brought life to a standstill around the globe. By comparison, the economies of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada - G7 countries - have only grown by about 1.4% during this time. The growth numbers are all the more impressive for the US considering inflationary pressures since late 2021 and global turmoil due to wars in Ukraine and Israel.\xa0', 'According to non-profit Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States real GDP is expected to grow by 1.6% in 2023 and 1% in 2024, even as growth in private consumption and investment moderates. Per the non-profit body, US exports and imports in 2023 are projected to decline from last year. Despite these figures, economic experts believe that the US economy will continue to battle challenges heading into 2024, chief among them being the rise in debt-to-GDP ratio.\xa0', 'According to a report by Forbes magazine, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the US will climb above 200% in the next two decades and is projected to reach a staggering 566% by the end of the century at the current date factoring in the aging population and lower long-term real growth. Getting this under control would require several expenditure restrictions and substantial increase in revenue for the government. Economic experts are of the view that spending in the manufacturing and tech sectors would help advance the long-term growth of the US economy.\xa0', 'Investors eager to profit from the boom in the US should consider investing in US stocks with strong fundamentals, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the dividend stocks and the latest news, then you can take a look at\xa0the 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett.', ""The US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% has been the catalyst behind inflationary pressures plunging from highs of 9.1% to about 3.1% as of November. While there were concerns that the high-interest rates would plunge the economy into recession, that has not been the case. A solid labor market and solid economic data depict the economy's resilience. However, the high-interest rate environment threatens to disrupt dividend-paying stock returns."", 'The high-interest rates in play, following the Fed hikes, translate to increased interest payments whenever companies borrow or raise capital through bonds, loans and convertible debt. The net result is an increase in interest expense that reduces companies’ earnings used to pay dividends.', ""When earnings decline due to extra expenses attributed to higher interest rates, one or two things might happen. The stock value might fall to adjust for the reduction in earnings. Secondly, the valuation multiples might rise as investors are forced to pay more for fewer future earnings. While higher valuation might help prop the stock's price in the short term, it may lead to higher volatility."", 'Professional investors sometimes turn to defensive dividend-paying stocks in a high-interest rate environment where earnings are constantly under pressure. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, always focuses on companies with solid fundamentals and competitive advantages. Such companies are the only ones capable of sustaining and increasing their dividends regardless of the prevailing macroeconomics.', ""While most investors focus on stocks offering high dividend yields, Buffett advocates for stocks with moderate yields from strong and prosperous companies. As of the end of the second quarter, most of the stocks in Buffett's portfolio were companies with a solid and long track record of increasing and paying dividends."", ""According to the legendary investor, the value of any dividend stock depends on the company's ability to generate earnings today and tomorrow. To identify such a company, investors ought to investigate the company's dividend history. It's the only way to identify companies with a solid track record of consistently increasing earnings, allowing them to pay dividends over at least five years."", 'It is a strategy that the legendary investor has perfected over the years going by his investments in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway, the holding firm that Buffett uses to invest in the equity markets, has seen its share of earnings through dividends in the beverage giant grow from\xa0$75 million in 1994 to $704 million\xa0as of 2022. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has also proved to be a successful investment for Buffett, with dividend returns having grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million as of last year.', ""Beyond earnings and profits that companies use to pay dividends, Buffett advocates for paying close watch to companies' revenues and cash flow\xa0growth rates. Such metrics provide valuable information on how a company operates and whether it can sustain its dividend program."", ""In some cases, a company's earnings used in paying dividends might be higher due to increased cuts in expenses rather than underlying revenue growth. However, if revenues are increasing, it means the company's core business is growing steadily to generate much-needed earnings for dividends."", ""Cash flow is another critical metric that Buffett pays close watch to as it represents the amount of money available to finance various operations. Any company with negative cash flow cannot continue operating for long and won't be able to pay any dividends."", ""The best dividend stocks have consistently proven their worth regardless of the prevailing market conditions. The stocks have played a significant role in affirming the S&P 500 returns over the years. The S&P 500 rose by about 777% between 1993 and the end of 2022. Including dividends, the index rose by about 1400%. In this case, dividends accounted for about 20% of the market's total return."", 'According to Buffett, investors should strive to invest in companies with a strong dividend history rather than investing in the overall stock market. Likewise, he constantly advocates for value stocks priced lower than their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have yielded a return of 626,000% since 1926, value stocks have generated\xa0a total return of 1,344,600%\xa0over the same period.', 'Amid the high inflation period in 2022, value stocks remained resilient, only going down by 7%. In contrast, growth stocks that some investors turn to because of their high dividend yield went down by about 28%.', 'Value stocks have not performed well as growth stocks in 2023, as depicted by the Russell 3000 Growth Index, beating its counterpart by 22%. Nevertheless, the stocks are expected to bounce back as their performance remains better in the long run.', ""Value stocks trading at discounted valuations have also proved their worth regarding dividend payouts. Given that the companies grow gradually and remain resilient amid challenging macroeconomics, they also tend to increase their dividend payouts gradually. Chevron is one such company in Buffett's portfolio that has increased its dividends for 36 years."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett's skillful stock-picking for passive income is evident as Berkshire Hathaway is anticipated to accumulate over $6 billion in dividend income in the upcoming year. Our examination of Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filings led us to identify top-performing stocks with consistent dividend payouts. The selected stocks are part of Berkshire Hathaway's Q3 2023 13F portfolio, and we specifically focused on those companies that regularly distribute dividends to their shareholders.

The firm expressed the following perspective:', '“The Kroger Co.\xa0(NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

However, the broader equity markets have started improving, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) recently crossing the 37,000 mark on Dec 13.', 'DJIA rallied amid speculations that the Federal Reserve is planning to cut interest rates several times next year. The Fed also kept interest rates unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, indicating that the inflationary pressure was easing now. The Dow is up 13.3% year to date. In comparison, the index was down 8.8% in 2022.', 'With Dow expected to continue its upward trajectory on rate cut speculations, investing in blue chip companies appears to be a prudent decision. These blue-chip stocks generally have a large market cap, solid cash flows, a healthy balance sheet and, in most cases, a stable dividend policy that aims to reward shareholders with risk-adjusted returns.', 'Investors can utilize the classic long-term stock picking strategy called ‘The Dogs of the Dow,’ which aims to deliver solid returns while maintaining low risk.', 'The strategy involves the purchase of equal dollar amounts of the ten Dow Jones Industrial stocks with the highest dividend yields (calculated by dividing a company’s dividend by its current stock price).', 'A very simple concept powers this strategy. The high-yielding stocks that make up the portfolio are the ones with prices that are lower relative to the dividend paid. This implies that these stocks have underperformed recently. These companies do not stay undervalued for too long as share prices of companies at the bottom of their business cycle appreciate relatively faster than companies at other stages of their business cycles.', 'In 1991, Michael O’Higgins, in his book, Beating the Dow, first introduced the investing strategy known as ‘Dogs of the Dow’ based on the DJIA.', 'However, the performance of this particular strategy remains uneven. Investors can consider this particular strategy as it is a dividend-based strategy. Generally, stocks with stable dividend policy are regarded as sound additions to one’s investment portfolio. Dividend-paying stocks carry low risk and are favored as these reduce the overall portfolio risk.', 'The yield on 10-year Treasuries, which is widely viewed as one of the safest havens, was closed at 3.89% as of Dec 19. With Fed planning rate cuts in the upcoming year, yields are expected to fall further. This makes investing in dividend stocks prudent.', 'We bring three stocks from the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ list that have a dividend yield of more than 3%.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'Added to the intrinsic value proposition of these stocks, a healthy dividend yield satisfies the appetite of risk-averse investors. The fact that these stocks have the potential to outperform the market while also historically providing a decent dividend yield has made them prized assets.', 'Let’s discuss three such stocks:', '3M Company MMM: Headquartered in St. Paul, MN, 3M Company, together with its subsidiaries, operates as a diversified technology firm.

', ""The strength of the Dow Dogs weakened in 2023 as rates remained high.

If you want to skip our take on how the gene editing industry sits right at the top of the global innovation food chain, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks. ', 'In the old days, alchemists were described as chemists who could turn lead into gold. A process undoubtedly perceived as magic, it offered dreamers a chance to untold riches by simply converting a low value metal into a high value asset. While modern day technology has still to convert anything into gold, it has also provided us with a slew of technologies that can comfortably lay the claim to being magical.', ""One such technology is the ability to manipulate genes. Genes are the 'software code' of the human body and they determine how tall we are, what color our eyes are, and when we'll start to lose our hair. At the same time, in a rather cruel demonstration of the human condition, they also determine if someone will get a deadly disease. Genetic disorders are some of the most debilitating diseases known to humans. Some examples of these diseases are Sickle Cell Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Brugada Syndrome. Among these, Sickle Cell Disease prevents patients, including children, from living their lives fully as their body cannot transport oxygen internally to lead to healthy functioning. People who suffer from Huntington's Disease target the human mind, making brain cells called neurons break down. If a sufficient number of neurons are significantly damaged, then patients, either children or adults, lose their ability to normally function."", ""Additionally, genetic diseases and their patients suffer from the additional complication of a lack of treatment options. Viral and bacterial infections such as the coronavirus or pneumonia can be treated by medicine that targets the invading pathogens. However, genetic diseases result from 'bugs' in the human body's software, so unless portions of this software are rewritten, the disease continues to wreak havoc. This re coding is at the heart of the genomic editing industry, and within its ambit is genetic engineering, a science that introduces new genetic material into the body."", ""This industry's potential also makes it quite lucrative. For instance, market research shows that the global genomics industry was worth $27.58 billion in 2021 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% until 2026 for a final value of $63.5 billion. If you're interested in knowing more about genomics, which is pure play gene editing, then you can check out 12 Best Genomics Stocks To Buy Now."", ""Shifting gears to see what's happening in the gene editing industry, the market is booming. In fact, December 2023 might be one of the most important months in the gene editing industry. This is because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two treatments for Sickle Cell Disease. These are developed through a partnership between Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) and by bluebird bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLUE). The Vertex+CRISPR treatment is the first of its kind that is developed through the CRISPR gene editing technology, and it marks a turn for the industry as it is one of the first genetic editing treatments that can be commercialized."", ""Of course, rewriting the human body's software is quite difficult. You can't use Python to do it, which makes such treatments among the costliest in the world. The Sickle Cell treatments from CRISPR+Vertex and bluebird cost an eye watering $2.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. While they are one time treatments, this price naturally will exclude most patients due to the high sticker price. Additionally, while they are cutting edge medical treatments, Sickle Cell medicine comes with its own side effects. According to the FDA, bluebird's treatment called Lyfgenia can cause blood cancer among patients - in a worrying example of from the frying pan into the fire."", 'So, as gene editing continues to make history, we decided to take a look at some of the most promising gene editing stocks according to analysts.

You should always be on the lookout for companies that can deliver rising dividends year after year. These stocks help to cushion your portfolio when volatility arises, and also put more cash in your pocket as you await a market recovery. Indeed, the best dividend payers don’t just offer attractive yields today. These companies consistently grow those dividends over decades, allowing compounding to work its magic.', 'What’s extra appealing is that many dividend stocks achieve S&P 500-beating total returns over time with substantially better risk profiles than the overall market. These companies’ defensive business models make them much less volatile than the overall index. This makes such dividend stocks the perfect long-term holdings for risk-averse investors like retirees and conservative portfolio managers looking for a lower portfolio beta. In short, when the broader market gets choppy, these seven dividend stocks act as safe harbor investments.', 'Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to stable industrial businesses, Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) stands out as one of the best buys right now. While not the most glamorous company, this industrial manufacturer has impressed me with its steady financial performance over the years. Through smart capital allocation and continuous efficiency gains, ITW has grown its earnings at a consistent clip in its mature sector.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Looking ahead, I don’t see any reason for this trend to stop. Analysts forecast almost 6% earnings per share growth for ITW this year. Notably, this number is expected to accelerate toward the double-digit range over the next few years. Revenue growth is also expected to pick up to more than 5% by 2026.', 'Sure, these aren’t breathtaking growth rates. But for a $75 billion industrial company, high single-digit earnings growth is mighty solid. To me, this shows ITW still has the legs to continue outpacing its peers.', 'With its proprietary business model, structural cost savings and proven recession resilience, I believe ITW makes for a compelling core industrial holding today. The stock won’t knock your socks off, but provides stable dividend growth to balance out the volatility in the rest of your portfolio. I continue to like what I see here.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/ampersandphoto', 'If you’re looking for a consumer staples stock that’s held up remarkably well over the decades, look no further than Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). This bakery company has seen its fundamentals remain healthy over time, with the company impressively recovering from downturns quickly. This makes Flower Foods one of the most stable stocks I’ve come across. However, FLO stock has broken its two-decade-long trajectory, since the pandemic scrambled things up.', 'However, this brief decline now looks like a temporary blip. Analysts forecast a quick earnings rebound in the company quarters as the company’s management team rights the ship. Flower Foods still holds leading brands and strong pricing power in its markets, which gives me confidence it can bounce back to new heights over the next couple of years. With the stock sitting near 2013 prices, I believe FLO stock has solid upside potential ahead as its results improve.', 'Sometimes, the highest-quality names get unfairly punished when unpredictable events hit. I think Flower Foods fits that bill today, given its long history of relative stability. Thus, I remain bullish on this company’s future prospects from this unusual rough patch.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'You won’t find many sectors more defensive than waste management. No matter the economic climate, volumes and pricing for trash haulers and recyclers tend to hold up well. But while some view Waste Management (NYSE:WM) as a boring low-growth company at this point, I see a quality cash cow still in its prime growth years.', 'Don’t let the perceived “boringness” fool you – analysts still forecast double-digit earnings growth for WM this decade, alongside 6%+ annual revenue growth. Waste Management holds an enviable competitive position in its sector, and produces ample cash to fund growth initiatives, hike its dividend, and continue repurchasing its shares.', 'Trash may stink, but WM stock smells like roses to me right now. Recession-resistant revenue and solid pricing power support an above-average growth trajectory in the years ahead. For investors seeking stability with a side of growth, WM stock checks the key boxes. The company’s premium valuation makes sense to me, given the defensive nature of the business.', 'Source: Michael T Hartman / Shutterstock.com', 'Looking for even more stability in waste hauling? Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) offers another solid choice. This trash and recycling giant holds a nearly identical profile: recession resilience, a strong market position, and double-digit forecasted earnings growth. Like Waste Management, Republic Services produces ample cash flow to fund tuck-in acquisitions, dividend hikes, and buybacks. That’s all while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.', 'I view both WM and RSG stock as long-term winners in this defensive sector. Their growth trajectory over the next decade looks largely similar in terms of revenue and earnings. But while these stocks have moved directionally together over the long run, RSG stock has actually outpaced WM stock over the past year. Notably, RSG stock is up almost 19% over that timeframe, whereas WM stock rose just 4%. This performance gap may close over time, but Republic’s relative strength is worth noting.', 'Ultimately, I don’t believe investors can go wrong owning either leader in the trash sector. The duo dominates the national landscape and their recession-resilient business models are worth investing in. If you want to double down on stability via the waste management sector, RSG stock should be on your shopping list.', 'While the recent passing of Charlie Munger initially spooked me on Berkshire (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), the stock has held surprisingly steady. Warren Buffett has prepared the company well for his eventual departure, with ample cash reserves, a diversified collection of “forever” stocks, and investing lieutenants in place to take over operations.', 'Even with Buffett still at the helm in his 90s, Berkshire remains a long-term winner in my book. The company has many levers to drive growth for years. These include a $157 billion cash pile for flexible investments, steadily-compounding stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), robust earnings from wholly owned subsidiaries, and its massive insurance float. Additionally, should crisis strike, Berkshire has prepared the mother of all rainy day funds. Buffett clearly sees the writing on the wall for a downturn, raising my conviction in this portfolio. Recession or not, Berkshire’s discipline and diversified earnings engines stand ready to churn out profits for generations to come.', 'Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com', 'For those looking to take a defensive posture and generate reliable dividend income, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) remains a must-own stock in my book. Walk the snacks aisle at any grocery store, and Pepsi’s dominance smacks you in the face. The company has effectively made its sugary treats a staple, etching itself into consumers’ daily lives. While discretionary by nature, Pepsi’s snacks and beverages generate dependable cash flows that hold up in a range of economic environments.', 'With PEP stock, you’re not just getting stability. You’re getting steadily-rising dividend income, too. This iconic company has achieved “Dividend King” status, now boasting 51 consecutive years of payout hikes. Yet, even as its business matures, Pepsi still delivers incremental growth, rewarding loyal shareholders with fatter dividend checks.', 'Trading at 22-times earnings, some call PEP stock expensive.

That's why new investors shouldn't jump in with both feet. Instead, take it slowly while you learn by doing (and hopefully by reading a few investment classics along the way, like Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor)."", 'A good starting place is to buy the stocks of companies you know because you regularly use their products and services, such as Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG).', ""It can be very easy to get caught up in the emotional side of Wall Street. That might have you chasing dangerous fads, like the meme stocks that blew up not too long ago. Or maybe today you'll be attracted to anything with an artificial intelligence angle even though there's no way to tell who the real winners will be just yet."", 'The point is, humans are fallible and particularly prone to greed and fear. If you are just starting out as an investor, you want to limit the risk you pose to yourself.', ""A great book to get your feet wet on the topic of the emotional mistakes you will likely make is The Little Book of Behavioral Investing. It's a quick read that covers a lot of ground, but you are almost certain to see your own mistakes reflected in many of the chapters."", ""Another good way to limit potential risk is to stick with a small number of stocks from companies you know. Some of the best options are probably sitting in plain sight, like retailers and consumer staples companies. In this way, you will have a better handle on the company's business, and you can keep tabs on it simply by living your daily life."", ""Costco and P&G are two stocks you might want to consider since they both have a growth bias to them. (To get a bit of background on growth investing, consider Philip Fisher's iconic book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits). Here is a quick look at these two companies."", ""As a club store, Costco is a bit different from most retailers because its customers pay a fee for the privilege of shopping there. This is a huge point of differentiation. Essentially, the membership fees provide a revenue source that supports Costco's profits and allows it to be more aggressive with its low-price ethos. That, in turn, keeps customers happily coming back and paying the annual dues each year. The more stores it opens, the more membership fees it collects, so store growth is also really important for the global retailer."", ""Some numbers will help. In the first quarter of its fiscal 2024, Costco posted revenue of $57.8 billion. The products it sold cost the company $50.5 billion, and selling, general, and administrative expenses tallied up to roughly $5.4 billion. In the end, the company's gross profit was a touch under $2 billion. But here's the interesting thing: Membership fees made up $1.1 billion of the company's revenue line and, thus, more than half of the gross profit. That's how important membership fees are to the company and why it works so hard to keep customer costs low."", ""Costco's stock is very rarely cheap. And it isn't cheap today. But it has a great track record of success behind it and is a wonderful way to learn while you invest. Given enough time, and new store openings (nine new stores were opened in Q1 alone), even paying a high price for the stock has historically worked out well for long-term growth investors."", 'While shopping at Costco, you might buy one of Procter & Gamble\'s products, sold under iconic name brands like Bounty, Crest, and Swiffer. That last brand is important because the product category that it dominates didn\'t even exist until P&G created it. It is an example of how the company uses research and development to create innovative new products and product advances. Nothing gets customers\' blood flowing like the words ""new"" and ""improved."" And that\'s exactly what P&G tries to offer again and again.', ""That's important because most of the products it sells are cash cows that have been around for a very long time (like toothpaste). The only way to differentiate a brand is by offering more value in some way. Many companies compete on price (selling products as cheaply as possible). P&G competes at the other end of the spectrum, charging premium prices for demonstrably better products."", ""Add in the industry giant's marketing and distribution strength, and it is a favorite of both retailers and end consumers. It isn't likely to grow as quickly as Costco, but slow and steady has been the long-term trend for decades."", 'Unlike Costco, however, P&G appears reasonably priced right now given that key valuation metrics, like price to sales and price to earnings, are below their five-year averages. But the extra attraction here for a new investor is that you can own a well-run growth company that is easy to understand and track.', 'Costco and P&G aren\'t perfect by any means. Note that neither is trading at bargain prices. It wouldn\'t be wise to ""bet the farm"" on either of them. But as a new investor, you\'ll want to stick with companies you know as you learn. These two industry bellwethers fit that bill, and they are historically well-run, too.', 'Once you build a little knowledge, hopefully by using the lessons of investors who have come before you (such as in the three books mentioned above), you can reach beyond this easy-to-understand-and-track pair and start swimming in the deeper end of the pool.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

Recent mortgage rate reductions and signals from the Federal Reserve about upcoming rate cuts have reignited the housing market.

Housing starts jumped to the highest level since May as the low inventory of existing homes on the market has created an opportunity for new construction.The Fed has also penciled in three rate cuts for 2024.

The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of 23% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Eaton’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Eaton ', ""According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 31.76x is currently well-above the industry average of 20.86x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Eaton’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Eaton. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ETN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ETN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ETN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ETN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

These diverse analyses will help you build your own Coke strategy, accounting for the company's strengths\xa0as well as its weaknesses."", ""Anders Bylund (Coca-Cola Bull): Like any other company, Coke has its shortcomings. The soft drink giant's sales took a harder hit from the COVID-19 crisis than archrival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), since Pepsi's large portfolio of snack foods softened that company's fall. Some bearish investors argue that Pepsi's more diverse product mix is a healthier business platform than Coca-Cola's sharp focus on various beverages. As a result, Coke's stock has lagged behind Pepsi in the coronavirus era."", ""But that's not the whole story. Despite its skinnier revenue streams, Coca-Cola's leaner business model generates far wider profit margins and free cash flows in the end. That's the power of outsourcing most of the production and distribution to a global network of partners and subsidiaries:"", ""Furthermore, I see Coca-Cola as a more innovative company than any of its chief rivals. For one, the conversion of in-house operations to outsourced partnerships continues. The company recently sold its Philippine operations to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners\xa0and a private equity firm, for example. That move puts nearly $2 billion of fresh cash in Coca-Cola's coffers while removing a low-margin contributor from the company's business mix.

Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 3 risks we have identified for PepsiCo visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by PepsiCo, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.36. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

368,fb32e1aa-90b0-3ec7-a36a-53e843f5b6db,DGX,2023-12-21,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) Unveils the 88-Compound NPS Test Panel,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-unveils-88-120100906.html,1703073660,STORY,"['DGX', 'HAE']","['Quest Diagnostics DGX recently launched its new confirmatory testing service for novel psychoactive substances (NPS). The new panel, which tests for 88 compounds, covers a broad array of drug classes, such as designer opioids, designer benzodiazepines, designer stimulants, fentanyl analogs, synthetic cannabinoids and other illicit additives.', 'The company developed the panel to address the changing drug epidemic, as revealed by its nationally representative Health Trends report, ""Drug Misuse in America 2023: The Growing Crisis of Novel Psychoactive Substances”. The Quest Diagnostics Health Trends reports are a series of data-supported scientific reports that provide insights into critical healthcare issues.', 'The “Drug Misuse in America 2023: The Growing Crisis of Novel Psychoactive Substances"" report sheds light on the drug crisis and its shift from the misuse of prescription opioids and fentanyl to NPS based on more than 3.6 million clinical laboratory drug tests performed by the company in 2022. The report also includes an analysis of 3,730 randomly selected ""remnant"" specimens tested using a pilot version of the new NPS test panel.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The findings align with a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), highlighting the increasing connection between xylazine and opioid overdose deaths while revealing the growing misuse of other NPS.', 'The Health Trends analysis also found that specimens in areas with low-income demographics were nearly seven times more likely to test positive for nonprescribed fentanyl than those linked to high-income communities. Researchers theorize that these differences are due to comparatively higher quality of care and generally greater access to resources in high-income communities.', 'NPS are versions of established prescription and illicit drugs that are routinely chemically altered to enhance drug effects and evade tracking by law enforcement. As their chemical composition frequently evolves, conventional point-of-care and laboratory test methods may fail to detect NPS, thereby increasing risks for individual patients and challenging efforts to understand their long-term health effects or prevalence in communities.', 'Two categories of drugs are rapidly accelerating the overdose crisis in America — other illicit additives (xylazine) and fentanyl analogs (acetyl fentanyl). In this context, Quest Diagnostics’ new test panel is designed to help healthcare providers detect potential drug misuse in patients prescribed controlled medications, such as opioids and other substances, amid a proliferation of synthetic or ""designer"" drugs in the nation\'s drug supply.', 'The new panel uses definitive liquid chromatography with advanced tandem mass spectrometry-based testing to establish NPS misuse. Quest Diagnostics’ team of toxicologists, medical experts and data analysts will periodically review and update the panel to include the most relevant and prevalent substances present in communities, backed by data.', 'Per a Research report, the drug screening market was valued at $8.48 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.4% till 2030.', 'Earlier this month, Quest Diagnostics was awarded a contract by the CDC to assess the burden of hepatitis C virus in the United States. The agreement marks a new phase of a decade-long collaboration between Quest and the CDC to improve hepatitis public health research based on insights from laboratory data.', 'In June 2023, the CDC published an MMWR report (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) based on Quest Diagnostics Health Trends data that found only one in three adults with evidence of hepatitis C viral infection have achieved viral clearance despite the availability of curative therapies.', 'In the past six months, DGX shares have decreased 1.5% compared to the industry’s rise of 3.3%.', 'Quest Diagnostics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).', 'Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Insulet PODD and DexCom DXCM.
