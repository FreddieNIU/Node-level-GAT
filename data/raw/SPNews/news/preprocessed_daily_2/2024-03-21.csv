If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating Social Security, you may go to 10 States That Won’t Tax Social Security Income in 2024. ', 'More than 71 million beneficiaries receive Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits in the United States of America. As of 2024, they were also entitled to a 3.2% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) to keep these benefits aligned with inflation. Albeit smaller than the 8.7% COLA that beneficiaries received back in 2023, the smaller raise implies that inflation in the country is finally witnessing some moderation.', ""If one perceives this year's COLA as small, the anticipation for what 2025 holds may prove even more eye-opening. Based on current inflation data, The Senior Citizens Group estimates that Social Security benefits will increase by 2.4% by 2025 only. This revelation may come as a surprise to individuals unfamiliar with the mechanics of this adjustment. Even for those well-versed in its workings, there remains a prevailing sentiment that their COLAs fall short of expectations, notwithstanding the mitigating effects of inflation."", '""Social Security benefits generally do keep up with inflation, though there is a lag,""', '-Rob Williams, managing director for financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).', 'Nevertheless, it must be noted here that Social Security isn\'t meant to be a complete replacement of one\'s retirement income. Rather, it is one of the ""three-legged stools"" of retirement income.', 'Here is what Rob from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) further has to say about Social Security:', '""If anything, these changes are a reminder that retirees\' incomes aren\'t truly fixed. Social Security benefits can change from year to year, and retirees can and should adjust their spending as their situation and the broader economic and financial environment evolve”.', 'If anything can be learned from these pointers from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), it is that Social Security mustn’t be your sole source of income in retirement. For those who are solely reliant on Social Security, things can get hard fast. Moreover, with these funds expected to be depleted by 2034, things are looking gloomy as beneficiaries expect cuts from then onward.', 'By the way, our website\'s expertise is in identifying stocks that insiders and hedge funds are piling into, and Charles Schwab is one of the those companies. Here is what one of those investors recently said about this promising stock: ""Charles Schwab is notable because the business and the stock both had a challenging year. The regional banking panic in the spring of 2023 created an opportunity for us to add to our position below $50 per share. Rising interest rates have impacted the business in ways both predictable and unpredictable, but the net result has been a crimping of earnings that will likely persist for another year or two. Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business. Further, Schwab’s enviable, high-return franchise remains, in our view, entirely intact. If we are right on both these counts, we should generate an attractive return from the current stock price across a range of long-term interest rate scenarios."" SCHW shares returned nearly 40% over the past year and as long-term interest rates fall over the next 12 months, SCHW should continue to deliver positive returns. You can find other stocks with huge upside potential on Insider Monkey. Now let\'s go back to our discussion about the social security benefits.', ""According to Turbo Tax by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), individuals who only have Social Security benefits in retirement don't have to include them in their gross income. According to these guys from Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), your gross income will therefore be equal to zero, and you won't have to file a federal income tax return. For those who have income that is not tax-exempt, they may have to pay income taxes in retirement."", ""If an individual's total income exceeds $25,000, or $32,000 for a married couple filing jointly, federal income taxes must be paid on their Social Security benefits. Below these thresholds, benefits remain un-taxed. It should also be noted here that the IRS will not tax more than 85% of your Social Security benefits."", 'For those who think that federal government tax on social security is a bummer, they should know that many states also tax these benefits at the state level. Yes, it’s true, Social Security is taxable in 2024 in quite a few states. The states that tax Social Security benefits in 2024 are Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia.', 'With that said, let’s check out all the states that don’t tax Social Security benefits in 2024.', ""A close-up of a person's hands counting a stack of coins, illustrating the importance of retirement solutions."", 'To compile the list of states that won’t tax social security, we began by listing out all the states in the USA and the District of Columbia.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Unum Group's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for Unum Group ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unum Group is:', '13% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Unum Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 14% seen over the past five years by Unum Group."", ""We then compared Unum Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.5% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Unum Group's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry."", 'Unum Group has a low three-year median payout ratio of 23%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 77% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.', ""Moreover, Unum Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 20%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 11%."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Unum Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years. While most investors are probably hoping for an end to this pattern in 2024, it nevertheless speaks to the unpredictable nature of stocks over the short term.', ""Historically, when volatility and uncertainty crop up, professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out companies that have consistently outperformed in virtually any economic climate. One perfect example of this is investors flocking to the FAANG stocks for more than a decade. But in recent years, it's stocks enacting splits that have been the cream of the crop."", 'A ""stock split"" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count. It\'s cosmetic in the sense that a stock split doesn\'t change a company\'s market cap or its operating performance.', ""A forward-stock split can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Conversely, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange. With few exceptions, investors tend to focus on high-flying businesses conducting forward-stock splits."", 'Companies that enact forward splits are usually highly profitable and on the leading edge of the innovative curve within their respective industries.', ""Since the midpoint of 2021, just shy of a dozen high-profile companies have completed forward-stock splits, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Amazon and Tesla conducted forward splits of 20-for-1 and 3-for-1 in 2022, respectively, while Walmart's 3-for-1 forward-stock split went into effect last month."", 'The reason these businesses have outperformed is because of their well-defined competitive advantages:', ""Amazon is an absolute juggernaut in e-commerce. The nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales it accounted for in 2023 was nearly six times more than Walmart, its next-closest competitor. Amazon is also the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform."", ""Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's producing a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced just shy of 1.85 million EVs and will likely make a run at topping 2 million production vehicles this year."", 'Walmart has been able to use its size as an advantage. Buying products in bulk helps to lower per-unit costs, which provides a competitive edge on price compared to most local stores and grocery chains. Meanwhile, the vastness of its stores and direct-to-consumer site encourages shoppers to stay within its ecosystem of products and services.', 'On Tuesday, March 19, another top-notch company announced that it would joining this exclusive group of stock-split stocks.', ""Following the closing bell on March 19, the board of directors of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced a 50-for-1 stock split, which is one of the largest forward splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Assuming the split is given the green light by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June, Chipotle will begin trading at a post-split price on June 26, 2024."", ""Chipotle went public in January 2006 at an initial offering price of $22 per share, but has never split its stock. Shares of the company neared the $3,000 mark shortly after the announcement. A 50-for-1 stock split would reduce Chipotle's share price to just shy of $60 per share, based on where it's trading at the time of this writing."", ""Said Chipotle's chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung,"", ""This is the first stock split in Chipotle's 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors. This split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth."", ""Interestingly, Chipotle's desire to make shares more nominally affordable for its employees echoes what Walmart said when in late January when it announced its 3-for-1 stock split."", ""Chipotle's continued outperformance, which led to this monumental stock split, can be summed up by three catalysts: food quality, its menu, and innovation."", 'With regard to the former, Chipotle has strived to use locally sourced vegetables and responsibly raised meats. Just as grocery stores benefited from the organic food push two decades ago, Chipotle is enjoying exceptional pricing power and increased demand because of its use of fresh ingredients.', 'Secondly, Chipotle tends to keep its menu relatively small. A small menu makes food preparation easier on its staff, which can expedite service times. A limited menu can also lead to more excitement when new food items are introduced.', 'Lastly, innovation has played an important role in the outperformance of Chipotle\'s stock. A perfect example is the introduction of ""Chipotlanes,"" which are drive-thru lanes specifically designed for mobile orders. Management has done a phenomenal job of improving the operating efficiency of its stores over time.', ""With Walmart completing its split in late February and Chipotle Mexican Grill on track to conduct its first-ever split in late June, it's just a matter of time before another high-quality company joins this exclusive club of stock-split stocks.

That's music to the ears of Broadcom."", ""Broadcom's operating performance is liable to be fueled by its Jericho3-AI chip, which the company introduced last spring. Jericho3 has the ability to connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units at once in AI-accelerated data centers. In other words, Broadcom boasts the critical infrastructure that'll be needed to support generative AI solutions and large language model training."", ""In addition to its undeniable AI ties, Broadcom's highly profitable foundation is its wireless chip segment. It's a leading provider of 5G wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones. A steady stream of consumers upgrading their wireless devices to take advantage of faster download speeds has led to a healthy backlog of orders for Broadcom."", ""Although Avago's management team has never pulled the trigger on a stock split, a share price north of $1,200 may be the catalyst needed to make the company's stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

Wage growth is outpacing the rate of inflation. Household net worth has increased since the pandemic,” said Furner. “There are a lot of objective indicators that the economy is in a really good place, but asking consumers about it, maybe their sentiments don’t match the reality.', '“The nagging problem is the stubborn inflation. Food inflation has been high but moderating.”', 'Furner’s comments came Wednesday during his discussion on the state of retail and the consumer with Matt Shay, president and chief executive officer of the NRF, which is now projecting that 2024 retail sales will increase between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent to between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion.', '“The resiliency of consumers continues to power the American economy, and we are confident there will be moderate but steady growth through the end of the year,” Shay said. “Successful retailers offer consumers products and services when, where and how they want to shop with prices they want to pay.”', 'The 2024 forecast compares with the 3.6 percent sales growth to $5.1 trillion last year, according to the NRF. The trade organization also pointed out that the 2024 forecast is “in line” with the 10-year pre-pandemic average annual sales growth of 3.6 percent.', 'The NRF also predicts that non-store and online sales, which are included in the total figure, should increase 7 to 9 percent, to between $1.47 trillion and $1.5 trillion, compared to $1.38 trillion last year. NRF’s\xa0retail sales numbers exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on what it considers core retail. NRF analyses use data from various U.S. government sources as well as the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, powered by Affinity Solutions.', 'Among those also participating in the presentation was Jack Kleinhenz, NRF’s chief economist, who said that GDP will grow around 2.3 percent this year, slowing somewhat from the 2.5 percent in 2023. Job growth will be sustained, he added, but there won’t be as much in 2024.', 'Kleinhenz, Shay and Furner concurred that consumers in the U.S. are resilient, and one reason is that wages have been growing recently. Last year, Walmart brought its average hourly U.S. wage to more than $17.50. Walmart’s previous minimum wage was $12 an hour.', '“The economy is primarily supported by consumers who have shown much greater resilience than expected, and it’s hard to be bearish on the consumer,” Kleinhenz said. “The question for 2024 ultimately is, will consumer spending maintain its resilience?”', 'Kleinhenz said he expects about 100,000 fewer jobs on average per month compared with 2023 and the unemployment rate to average 4 percent in 2024.', 'Still, Kleinhenz also cited the “wealth effect” of rising home and stock prices seen in 2023 probably continuing in 2024.', 'Katherine Cullen, NRF’s vice president of industry and consumer insights, described the current state of consumer spending, saying, “Consumers continue to spend in January and February and are not afraid to splurge on special events.” Also, “spending on health and personal care surged in January and February.”', 'With general merchandise, “We are seeing some deflation,” Cullen said. But due to inflation, a lot of consumers are more choiceful, she said.', 'Furner emphasized that convenience in the shopping experience has become increasingly important. “People are willing to trade off for things that are more convenient — things that save time,” Furner said. “People are looking for more and more ways to spend time with families and experience things they didn’t experience before. The underlying trend of convenience I think is here to stay.”', 'Regarding the state of the supply chain, Furner said, “At Walmart we generally see things as much more stable than they have been for several years. We are proud of the diversification of some of the ways we procure and source goods.” Flexibility “is really important, to weather unexpected events. A whole series of things can be out of your control.”', 'Furner also emphasized the importance of combating organized retail crime, which is plaguing the industry. “Historically we talked about shrink, but there is a real human dimension that impacts everyone in the stores and drives up prices. It happens at the port of entry, online and not only in stores. This is an issue that affects communities, access to products, causes prices to rise, and can cause stores to close, and that affects employment, taxes and services in communities. We need to keep prices low despite improvements in the economy and wages growing.', '“The industry, lawmakers, the Department of Homeland Security, we need to work together to solve this issue,” Furner said.', 'Best of WWD', 'Inside the Demise of Lord & Taylor\xa0', 'COVID-19 Spikes Elevate Retail Concerns', ""Selfridges' New Owners Bank On a Retail Renaissance in City Centers""]"

The concept alludes to creating a highly liquid asset profile that can withstand financial shocks while being able to deploy capital to fund spending pursuits. In 2023, U.S. consumer balance sheets were expected to wither under elevated levels of inflation and a tightened monetary policy environment—however, the level of excess savings and spending power continued to be underestimated. Consumers demonstrated a willingness and capacity to spend on goods and services throughout the year, while market participants continued to miss the mark on when consumer savings would be depleted. Notably, personal savings increased 46.4% year-over-year (YOY), albeit, compared to near historically low savings levels experienced in 2022. This culminated in Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) surging past consensus estimates, increasing 3.3% YOY, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.', 'In 2023, the economy witnessed a substantial shift in spending that heavily favored the Services segment. Personal consumption expenditures on services increased 7.4% YOY, over double the YOY growth experienced by goods spending (3.3%). This marked the widest difference of services spending growth over goods spending growth since 2009. Areas such as Recreation Services, Food Services & Accommodations, and Housing & Utilities Services exceeded overall growth in services spending. Evidence of this trickled into M&A markets, with Food-adjacent sectors and the Home Goods space registering YOY increases in total M&A transaction volume.', 'It remains to be seen if the Federal Reserve can start their victory lap on achieving the heralded soft-landing scenario that dominated headlines throughout the year. At the conclusion of 2023, it seems the U.S. economy has avoided the drastic recession that many market participants had anticipated.

During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, which Microchip Tech falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Microchip Tech is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share, indicating a change of -65.2% from the year-ago quarter.

In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Microchip Tech is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

The energy produced by its West Virginia solar sites will support economic growth in the region, as more companies demand that a certain percentage of the electricity purchased comes from renewable sources.', ""The company has five proposed solar projects in West Virginia, the second of which is the Rivesville facility. The company's first solar site, which sits on 80 acres at the Fort Martin Power Station, was connected to the distribution grid in January 2024 and can produce up to 18.9 megawatts (MW) of solar energy per hour.The proposed 27-acre Rivesville solar facility in Marion County will be located along the Morgan Ridge Road. Once deployed, the solar panels at the facility have the potential to generate up to 5.5 MW of clean energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association states that 1 MW of solar energy can power approximately 173 homes across the nation.In the end, it is anticipated that the five locations owned by the corporations will produce 50 MW of renewable energy. It is expected that work on the Rivesville site and a third site (5.7 MW) in Berkeley County should be completed by the end of 2024. After consumers subscribe to the electricity produced, the businesses also intend to apply for final approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission to construct two more solar sites in Davis, Tucker County (11.5 MW), and Weirton, Hancock County (8.4 MW)."", ""According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will increase 24% and 25% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.As stated by EIA, the electric power sector added 19 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in 2023 (an increase of 27%). It expects 36 GW to be added in 2024 and another 35 GW in 2025. With this new capacity, EIA expects solar to provide 6% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2024 and 7% in 2025, up from a contribution of 4% in 2023.Along with FE, some other electric power industry companies like Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, AVANGRID AGR and Dominion Energy, Inc.

More than 150,000 houses will have access to the 710 MW project's yearly energy supply.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.02%.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.52b', 'US$11.7b', 'US$13.3b', 'US$14.5b', 'US$17.2b', 'US$19.6b', 'US$21.3b', 'US$22.7b', 'US$24.0b', 'US$25.0b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x26', 'Analyst x23', 'Analyst x25', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Est @ 8.75%', 'Est @ 6.81%', 'Est @ 5.46%', 'Est @ 4.51%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% ', 'US$8.0k', 'US$10.3k', 'US$10.9k', 'US$11.1k', 'US$12.3k', 'US$13.1k', 'US$13.3k', 'US$13.3k', 'US$13.1k', 'US$12.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$118b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.3%) = US$547b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$547b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$279b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$397b.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is not viewed as a risk.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.', 'Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.', 'Threat', 'Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.', 'Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

The attention is still novel, despite having struck viral fame a few years ago with a TikTok post of her skateboarding on sandstone in the desert that has racked up 1.8 million views.', 'All in all though, living “in the middle of nowhere,” Glasses said, “we’re very off-the-grid so I don’t come in contact with [that many] people all the time. I’m kind of in a little bubble out here.”', 'That may be, but her surroundings and her artistic heritage continue to benefit the masses and foster a great appreciation for the Navajo Nation and Indigenous people in general.', 'Acknowledging how much “Killers of the Flower Moon” actress Lily Gladstone has helped to bolster Indigenous representation in the media, Glasses also praised model Quannah ChasingHorse, actress Amber Midthunder and the FX teen-centered series “Reservation Dogs” as some of the other contributors. She added, “We as Indigenous people are having our big moment. I really hope that it’s not just a moment, but something that continues and we can just become mainstays as part of the bigger world.”', 'Asked why such recognition of Indigenous people hadn’t happened sooner, Glasses chalked that up to timing. “At this time, when everyone is calling for change and more representation, this is the right time and the right moment for it.” She speculated that 20 years ago increased exposure wouldn’t have been as impactful, given how much more engaged people are now on social media, how much easier it is to reach artists and how more people are increasingly willing to listen.', 'The just-out Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi Glasses’ “Color in Motion” drop features 24 styles of women’s, men’s and unisex styles in bold colors and Glasses’ contemporary takes on Navajo motifs such as four-directional crosses.

However vibrant the new collection is, Glasses said she is accustomed to such bold hues. ”I pulled a lot of inspiration from different parts of our surroundings. When I look at some of the designs, it almost feels like home to me,” she said.', 'Once again the new campaign was shot by a Native crew that included Ryan RedCorn (Osage) and Daryn Sells (Diné/Navajo) and this time Shaandiin Tome (Navajo) handled the video. — and features some of Glasses’ friends and fellow community members.

CROX appears well-poised for growth, thanks to its robust business strategies. The company has been gaining from solid consumer demand across the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, backed by effective pricing actions. In fourth-quarter 2023, its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 15th consecutive time. Buoyed by such upsides, this currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has gained 28.7% in the past three months against the industry’s 5.9% drop.', 'Crocs has been seeing strength in clogs, sandals and personalization for a while now. Each of the three categories grew double digits during 2023. In 2023, the HEYDUDE brand delivered revenues of nearly $950 million and more than $200 million in operating income. The company’s Jibbitz business has also been doing well for quite some time now. This business increased 17% to more than $0.25 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the total mix in 2023.Management continues to view personalization as a mega-consumer trend, with the opportunity of expanding the Jibbitz penetration in 2024 via better wholesale execution, deeper international penetration and advanced speed to market capabilities.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Crocs has been witnessing a decline in inbound freight costs, which has been contributing to gross margins for quite some time now. Also, favorable ocean freight rates, the absence of air freight and lower promotional activity in the Crocs brand have been acting as tailwinds. In fourth-quarter 2023, the adjusted gross profit rose 6.1% year over year, while the adjusted gross margin expanded 240 basis points to 55.7%, owing to gains from lower freight costs across both brands.Such factors make us optimistic about the stock. Crocs had earlier outlined its long-term strategy and key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. It had then expected to generate revenues of more than $5 billion by 2026, representing compounded annual growth rate of more than 17% by 2026. It anticipated attaining the revenue target driven by strong digital sales, improved market share for sandals, growth in Asia and innovative product and marketing. Management expects four times revenue growth in sandals by 2026. The company targets at least 50% of total revenues to come from digital channels by the end of 2026. Driven by strong revenue growth, the company anticipates improved profitability and cash flows through 2026.To wrap up, Crocs seems to be an attractive investment bet, given all the aforementioned positives. In addition, analysts seem quite optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $4.1 billion and $12.38, respectively. These estimates show corresponding growth of 3.9% and 2.9% year over year.

Nationwide, sellers listing during that week are likely to see the best conditions for listing prices, buyer demand and sales pace, as well as lower chances of price reductions and competition from other sellers. A recent survey from Realtor.com® found that the majority (53%) of home sellers took one month or less to get their home ready to list, so the time to start prepping is now.', '""Spring is generally the high season for home sales, and buyers tend to be more plentiful earlier in the year,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Because listing a home is a process, sellers should start preparing now so they can list their home at a time when conditions are likely to be most favorable, giving them the best chance of selling their home quickly and at a competitive price.""', ""Why is April 14-20 the best time to sell in 2024?While some home buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to fall further before entering the housing market, it's still a good time for homeowners to sell as buyers continue to be in need of more for-sale options, with inventory still almost 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Those looking to take advantage of seasonal market trends should consider getting ready to list April 14-20 for the best mix of market conditions for sellers, including:"", ""Above-average prices – The prices of homes listed during this week have historically been 1.1% higher than the average week, and are typically 10.4% higher than at the start of the year. If 2024 follows last year's seasonal trend, the national median listing price could be $7,400 higher than the average week, and $34,000 more than at the start of the year."", 'Above-average buyer demand – The more buyers looking at homes, the better it is for offers and sales. Historically, this week saw 18.4% more views per listing than the typical week, but in 2023 this week got 22.8% more views per listing than the average week during the year. Demand will in part depend on mortgage rates – falling rates may increase spring demand, while steady or rising rates may prompt some buyers to hold off.', ""Faster market pace – Thanks to above-average demand, homes tend to sell more quickly during this week. Historically, homes actively for sale during the week of April 14 sold 17%, or about 9 days, faster than in the average week. In 2023, this week typically saw homes on the market for 46 days on average, 6 days faster than the year's average. With inventory levels remaining low, sales may happen more quickly as buyers compete for fewer properties."", 'Less competition from other sellers – With past seasonal trends likely to persist, there would be 13.7% fewer sellers in the market this week compared to the average week during the year. Active inventory was 14.8% higher in February versus last February, but still 39.7% lower than pre-pandemic levels. This gap means there will continue to be opportunities for sellers entering the market this spring.', 'Below-average price reductions\xa0– Price reductions tend to be lowest in late winter and early spring as buyer activity ramps up. Historically, about 24.6% fewer homes have had a price decrease this week compared to the average week of the year. In 2023, this week saw about 8,000 fewer listings with price reductions compared to the average week of the year.', ""Key factors for the 2024 housing market and tips for getting ready The 2024 housing market is expected to behave according to typical seasonality, but will likely offer slightly better conditions than in 2023.

For almost half (48%), it took less time than expected to list their home, while 11% said it took more time than they expected. Here are some market and other factors for sellers and buyers to keep an eye on as they navigate the spring housing market and beyond:"", 'Prices tend to peak later in the year – but so will competition. By the end of June, prices have historically reached near-peak levels (+13.8%) compared to the beginning of the year, while the number of new sellers increased by even more (+49.3%). By entering the market earlier, sellers can head off that competition, increasing the odds of a successful close and favorable terms. Working with an experienced agent can help sellers prepare for and navigate their local market dynamics. Realtor.com® RealChoice Selling lets sellers get proposals from multiple agents in their area to compare and pick the right professional who can help with their sale, and all without a commitment.', ""Mortgage rates will determine the level of market activity. Mortgage rates are expected to ease to the mid-6% range later in the year, and once rates decline, we'll likely see an increase in potential buyers based on a recent Realtor.com®\xa0survey of Americans looking to buy this year, welcome news for those on the fence about selling.

Amidst the current rally (bubble?), we’ve seen stocks rise, plummet, and rise again, pushing investors toward small-caps, tech, and growth stocks. But, while profitable thus far, that might be the wrong move, while blue-chip represents foundational stability sorely lacking within many portfolios.', 'The economic landscape remains uncertain, far from a clear path to recovery as inflation remains frustratingly above the Fed’s 2% target.

This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.', 'This uptick in housing movement directly benefits U-Haul, as more individuals opt for the cost-effective DIY moving approach. Recent statistics show that only 22% of movers hire a company for their moving needs, while 37.5% choose to rent a truck and move themselves. With household budgets remaining constrained, a decrease in interest rates and an increase in residential relocations are expected to further bolster the preference for DIY moving, underscoring U-Haul’s strategic advantage in the market.', 'Source: xalien / Shutterstock', 'Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mounting an epic comeback, surging more than 200% following its 2022 slump, reasserting its position as a blue-chip stock. At that time, intense competition and faltering subscription growth dimmed its allure among investors, casting doubt on its status as a former FAANG heavyweight. But this narrative is swiftly shifting as Netflix reclaims its blue-chip media stock spot, underscored by its impressive fourth-quarter earnings report in January.', 'In a challenging year for consumer cyclicals, marked by tightened household budgets in 2023, Netflix demonstrated its unique position within our media consumption ecosystem. The company reported a 12% increase in overall revenue for the year, while its operating margins rose to 21% from 18%. Furthermore, Netflix welcomed over 13 million new subscribers in the final quarter alone, highlighting the platform’s enduring appeal.', 'Netflix’s strategy to enforce stricter password-sharing policies has evidently paid off, contrary to fears of alienating users who previously accessed the service through borrowed credentials. Instead, these individuals appear to have transitioned into paying subscribers. Should this pattern persist, Co-CEO Greg Peters’ assertion that curbing password sharing will “support increased conversion of our addressable market in many years to come” could very well materialize, signaling a bright future for Netflix in the competitive streaming landscape.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock.com', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a unique choice among blue-chip stocks, perfectly bridging the gap between “hard tech,” robotics, and global healthcare. A member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is lauded as one of the most stable and omnipresent manufacturers of high-end, niche medical hardware. Unlike its competitors, who typically focus on traditional medical hardware like MRI machines and the like, Intuitive Surgical infuses the surgical space with robotics and automation, adopting an innovative, high-growth approach.', 'As post-pandemic challenges within the healthcare sector ease, Intuitive Surgical is pushing forward with its international expansion efforts. The most recent quarterly update highlighted a significant 21% year-over-year growth in global procedures using Intuitive Surgical’s flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, alongside a 14% increase in new da Vinci installations. Supporting its status as a blue-chip MedTech stock, Intuitive Surgical also announced a 17% increase in sales and a substantial rise in net income to $606 million, up from $325 million. All in all, it’s one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.', 'Watch ISRG stock closely this year as the company anticipates launching its next-generation da Vinci platform shortly.

Moreover, the company has a track record of regularly increasing its dividend, with a recent 8% hike to $0.46 per share, marking a consistent rise for five consecutive years and maintaining a 100% quarterly payment rate throughout this period, underscoring its commitment to delivering shareholder value.', 'In 2023, Steel Dynamics celebrated its second-highest revenue year, with sales reaching $18.8 billion and net income standing at a solid $2.5 billion.

But, as American media consumption shifts towards next-generation formats, NWSA stands out for its successful pivot toward those emergent trends.', 'The push for NWSA’s evolution partly comes from Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently acquired a significant stake in the company. Following the investment, NWSA’s quarterly revenue jumped 3% year-over-year, alongside a 94% net income boost. CEO Robert Thomson credits these financial improvements to the company’s strategic move towards digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the unpredictability of advertising revenues.', 'This approach mirrors the strategy of many software-based blue-chip stocks, which prioritize recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For example, NWSA is allocating effort toward digital subscription acquisition instead of high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers Photoshop subscriptions for a monthly fee rather than a hefty one-time purchase.', 'This strategic shift is proving fruitful as NWSA also zeroes in on niche markets, notably its Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, showcasing strong performance. While NWSA currently de-emphasizes dividends to streamline its operations for the digital age, it still maintains a modest 1.55% total yield, balancing operational adjustments with shareholder returns.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Though travel stocks tend to be cyclical and, at times, volatile, there’s no doubting Marriott International’s\xa0(NASDAQ:MAR) blue-chip stock status.

During his March 7 program on CNBC, Cramer wondered “how big is AI” and said the AI-led “technological revolution” is “crossing all barriers” and could potentially become the “heart” of the American national security apparatus. Jim Cramer said that AI could be key to making the “biggest amount of money” over the next five years.', 'Jim Cramer yet again took a swing at AI naysayers who he called “bubble busters.” Cramer said these AI bears are “all around” him and it drives him “crazy.” After discussing Nvidia’s dominance in the AI industry and how the company is expected to remain at the top of the AI food chain because of its high performance chips, Jim Cramer started discussing stocks that would benefit from the AI revolution. Some of these companies would benefit from AI directly while others would see a huge demand for their products and services indirectly.', 'Jim Cramer also attended the recently-concluded Nvidia GTC conference and televised his program directly from there. Cramer said that there are many non-tech companies in partnership with Nvidia and keeping an eye on these companies could unlock huge opportunities for investors. Cramer believes these non-tech partners should “represent the best opportunities” since these companies usually stay under the radar.', 'Cramer often talks about mega-cap tech stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that will grow because of AI. But in this article we decided to take a look at some of the lesser known and under-the-radar stocks Jim Cramer believes would grow thanks to the AI revolution. Most of these are non-tech companies that would benefit from the AI wave directly or indirectly due to the AI ecosystem that is forming as companies begin to develop generative AI applications for hundreds and thousands of use cases.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15', 'Jim Cramer is excited about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) after the company revealed its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer recently admitted he hasn’t been a fan of Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) in the past because the company became public via a SPAC. Most of the SPAC IPOs, according to Cramer, were “garbage.” However, Cramer said it’s time to open the books on Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) since he believes Nvidia’s partnership could infuse a “life” in the stock.', 'In addition to GETY, Cramer also recommends NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).', ""During the company's Q4 earnings call Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)'s management talked about partnership with Nvidia:"", '""In partnership with NVIDIA, we announced and launched a truly unique generative image offering, an offering that is trained on licensed and released data and rewards content creators for the training, and offering that respects third-party intellectual property rights and a social and responsible and that it cannot produce deepfakes, an offering that is commercially safe and indemnified, an offering that produces high-quality outlets.', 'We launched Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) and VA-API in Q4, a nice stock in January of this year. Of course, with all things AI, the pace of innovation is break-neck. In recent weeks, we have already introduced expanded controls and capabilities such as in-panning and out-panning. We’ll be releasing a newly trained model soon and we will also enable AI capabilities across our entire pre-shop creative library. We also have big plans for video and partnership with NVIDIA and Runway, which we expect to launch later this year aligned to the commercial needs of our customers. While we continue to face macro challenges, as always we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers and long-term returns to our shareholders. At the core of Getty Images is high-quality content and coverage that is derived from top-notch talent, exclusive access, extensive research and rare expertise.', 'We pair this with world-class customer service across committed and long-standing relationships and the delivery of technology that truly enhances the creativity, productivity and efficiency of our customers without risks. With our solid foundation and clear vision and focus, we’re excited to return to growth in 2024.""', 'Read the entire earnings call transcript here.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 33', 'Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is among the list of companies that are set to benefit from the rising demand of clean energy amid the AI-based data centers wave. Cramer thinks companies deploying massive data center resources for generative AI applications would need to power their systems via cheap energy, which should also be clean. Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) provides solutions to enhance the efficiency of solar energy systems. That’s why Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is poised to benefit in the coming days.', 'Last month Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) posted strong quarterly results. J.P. Morgan increased its price target on the stock to $73 from $61.', 'During its Q3 earnings call Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) talked about data center-driven demand and opportunities:', '""Over the last few years however, energy usage has increased dramatically driven by growth and data centers, electrification of appliances and transportation and reindustrialization across the United States. At the same time there has been a significant retirement of legacy power plants.', 'The combination of these factors has caused the U.S. Energy Information Administration to forecast a 5% annual increase need for new power generation capacity in the grid over the next five years. The result is that almost 300 gigawatts of new power plants are needed over the next five years and about 500 gigawatts of new power is needed over the next decade. Where is this massive amount of new power going will come from? The U.S. CIA historically very conservative on renewables is forecasting that solar and wind power will comprise the vast majority of new power generation. Solar is expected to have a 26% compound annual growth over the next five years and within 10 years be the number one source of electric generation in the United States comprising almost a quarter of all electric energy.', 'Naysayers point to the intermittency of renewable power as an impediment to its large scale adoption in the grid. We believe this issue will improve. Sharp decreases in battery costs have enable steep ramping of battery storage, power plants in the grid both co-located with renewable power and standalone project.""', 'Read the full earnings all transcript here.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 48', 'Jim Cramer, who has been bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) for the past several months, thinks the huge rise of datacenters after the AI wave could further boost Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) since the company would play a key role in AI infrastructure building.', 'In January, Cramer grilled Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) bears, who, according to the analyst, were talking about “bogus” concerns about inventory slowdown problems for the company. Cramer, whose charitable trust owns a stake in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), said he held onto the stock and got rewarded. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shares are up by about 58% over the past one year.', 'Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Caterpillar Inc.\xa0(NYSE:CAT), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, also performed well this quarter. Caterpillar has managed to leverage increased capital investment from various end markets, contributing to better than expected fiscal results for Q2. The company is poised to be one of the largest beneficiaries of several government funding initiatives, including the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) bill, CHIPS Act and infrastructure bill. These measures are expected to support construction spending for several years, providing a robust backdrop for Caterpillar’s continued growth.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 41', 'Jim Cramer recently said that the rise of generative AI applications are creating huge demand for data centers, which in turn creates demand for power and energy management solutions. Cramer said AI data centers have to be connected to the grid that have low energy costs and “for many” this energy has to be clean. This is where companies like Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) come into play, according to Cramer. Cramer said that Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) is helping major companies become carbon neutral as it provides clean energy.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 56', 'Jim Cramer is bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) because the company has a partnership with Nvidia. Cramer believes the new AI wave could revolutionize the medical diagnostics systems. In a latest program, Cramer said Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) could create a more effective endoscopy module to better detect colorectal cancer.', 'In addition to MDT, Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).', 'Polen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is the largest medical technology company in the world. Despite a few tough years characterized by post-COVID supply chain issues, Chinese market payment changes, and diabetes business challenges, the company has continued to invest aggressively in its R&D pipeline. Because of this long-term mindset and commitment to product innovation, the company is in a position today where it has numerous significant new product launches across the business, helping to accelerate growth and improve profitability. More recently, the market’s infatuation with the promise of GLP-1 drugs has resulted in valuation de-ratings across the medtech industry broadly, to which Medtronic was not immune. The combination of all of these factors has resulted in Medtronic shares trading at their lowest valuation in a decade.

However, investors have grown bullish about the industry again, thanks to exciting prospects in sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.', 'As a result, the same index is up 51% year over year. Investors have rallied over the ""Magnificent Seven,"" a phrase used to describe the seven most influential companies in tech. The seven include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla.', 'These companies are investing heavily in AI, an industry projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, chipmaker Nvidia has seen exponential growth over the last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide.', ""Nvidia's stock is up 245% since last March. However, earnings per share (EPS) estimates indicate it has much more to offer as the AI market develops. Here are three reasons to buy this Magnificent Seven stock before it rises 40%."", ""Nvidia achieved an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs last year. The company's massive success in the industry motivated several tech firms to venture in, as well. In 2024, AMD and Intel began shipping new AI GPUs specially designed to challenge Nvidia's offerings. However, Nvidia has pulled so far ahead in the industry that it's unlikely to lose its dominance any time soon."", ""In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales."", ""In addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion."", ""Despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy."", ""Despite a soaring stock price, Nvidia's stock has increased in value over the last year."", ""The chart above shows that Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months."", ""P/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow."", ""These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. Nvidia's declining figures indicate that now could be the best time to consider adding its stock to your portfolio."", ""As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position in tech. In addition to supplying its hardware to AI developers, the company's chips can be found powering a wide range of devices, from cloud platforms to video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more. While a spike in AI GPU sales is mainly responsible for Nvidia's stellar financial growth over the past year, the company has also benefited from a recovering PC market."", ""According to Gartner, PC shipments popped 0.3% in Q4 2023, marking the first such increase in over a year. Market improvements have been reflected in Nvidia's sales, with its PC-centered gaming segment reporting a 56% year-over-year rise in revenue in its latest quarter."", 'A leading role in AI and a recovering PC market suggest that Nvidia has a strong outlook in the coming years. EPS estimates seem to support this.', ""The table above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit close to $35 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36 yields a stock price of $1,252."", ""Considering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 41% over the next two years. The company may not replicate last year's growth but would still beat the S&P 500's 23% growth since 2022.

For what it\'s worth, this article is predicated on my belief that most of these companies are overvalued right now, and returns for the next three years consequently look modest to me.', ""Against this backdrop, I believe Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has a much higher chance of skyrocketing over the next three years. Its market-beating potential isn't a guaranteed outcome. But there are several reasons to believe this stock is a coiled spring ready to be released. Here are three of them."", 'If the ""Magnificent Seven"" is expensive as a whole, Roku stock is downright cheap. This is the first reason to be optimistic about its potential over the next three years.', ""Roku stock is down nearly 90% from its all-time high in 2021. Since its high, the company's price-to-sales (P/S) valuation has dropped from almost 30 to where it trades now at a P/S ratio of 2.6."", 'This represents about a 90% drop in the valuation of Roku stock -- in other words, the drop in stock price is 100% valuation related. And this is a good thing for investors who buy shares today. A cheaper stock can be less risky than an expensive one, provided the business creates shareholder value in the future.', 'Roku can create shareholder value with profitable growth, which brings me to my next reason why this stock can perform well over the next three years.', ""Many skeptics question Roku's competitive advantage for providing a connected-TV operating system and hardware. And it's a fair question. Some Roku shareholders might point to the neutrality of the platform compared to companies such as Amazon, which provides similar products and services but also has its own streaming service."", ""To me, this argument for Roku's competitive advantage isn't satisfying. Therefore, it's fair to worry about competition when it comes to Roku."", ""That said, competition hasn't been a problem so far, and this is an important point. The company ended 2023 with 80 million active accounts, up 14% year over year, making it the largest connected-TV company."", ""Roku's 80 million active accounts is significant for its growth potential for two reasons. First, it's still attracting new users at a compelling rate, which bodes well for its future revenue potential. Second, there's a strong case that its current accounts are undermonetized."", ""Roku generates revenue by displaying ads. Active accounts are up, and streaming hours are up, too. But its average revenue per user dropped 4% year over year in the most recent quarter, reflecting a weak advertising market. I'm not sure when it will happen, but I expect a full advertising rebound within the next three years."", ""Roku's revenue could go up by gaining new accounts and by increased advertising demand, which would lead to higher ad rates. These two sources of top-line growth could consequently lead to explosive revenue growth at some point in the near future."", ""Roku had nearly an $800 million operating loss in 2023 -- when discussing shareholder-value creation, this is a problem. That said, the company has demonstrated profitability in the past, so it's possible. And the profit margin was actually quite good for a brief time."", ""According to management, Roku's current losses are intentional -- it's aggressively lowered its hardware prices and is spending money to gain market share. One might disagree with the premise or the approach. But if true, this suggests that the company's losses are temporary and at some point, profits will improve."", 'When it comes to Roku stock skyrocketing over the next three years, I feel very comfortable making two statements: The stock is cheap now, and its revenue will likely soar in coming years. That forms the basis for my conviction that it could outperform the Magnificent Seven.', ""The third issue regarding Roku's profits is more of a wild card, but nonetheless important. Part of the reason the stock is cheap is the market doesn't believe the company has what it takes to sustainably generate positive cash flow. If Roku bucks the bearish narrative and turns the corner on profits, expect the market to finally give it more credit."", ""On the other hand, if in three years Roku is still racking up losses like it is today, I'd expect Roku stock to be a market laggard. The company can't operate indefinitely with losses this large."", 'Personally, I believe Roku has what it takes and believe its prospects will get better with scale.

Conversely, industry data suggests independent jewelers accelerated their deep discounts in lab-created diamonds and stepped up their discounting for natural diamonds modestly.', ""This resulted in heavy AUR declines among independents. Our life cycle product management continues to be a source of strength, driving inventory levels down 10% compared to the prior year. As we take markdowns from slower moving products earlier, this also allows us to bring in relevant new items faster, which have higher margins. Continuing the trend we saw for most of fiscal '24, jewelry retailers that catered to the low-priced Fashion category outperformed."", ""Likewise, Banter, our value-oriented Fashion banner delivered the strongest same-store sales in the U.S. this quarter, nearly flat. We also saw strong performances at Peoples in Canada and value banner H.Samuel in the U.K., both of which delivered positive same-store sales over the holidays. Offsetting the stronger performance in our core, we had challenges at our digital banners from operational and integration issues resulting in lower fulfillment, which have continued into fiscal '25."", 'This was caused by the integration of Blue Nile with production partners, resulting in lower conversion rates in the last six weeks of the quarter, reducing our overall North American same-store sales by 1 point. We are working to resolve these issues and expect to have fixes implemented later this year. We also underperformed in our Ernest Jones banner in the U.K., in part from macro challenges as well as a more negative halo impact from the November sale of our luxury watch stores. We estimate our U.S.', ""jewelry merchandise market share for fiscal '24 was approximately 9%, down modestly from the prior year, driven by mix shift with lower engagements as well as the relative strength in lower-priced self-purchase items where we have less penetration. We believe that we expanded our market share in the Bridal category for fiscal '24 by approximately 50 basis points, which is where we over-indexed to the industry with nearly 30% market share. The second takeaway today is that our flexible operating model is working as designed and generating significant cash, fueled by continued cost savings, sourcing efforts and inventory discipline. We continue to drive working capital efficiencies in our business, which led to a 97% free cash conversion to non-GAAP operating income."", 'We believe our ability to drive free cash flow will continue. This allows us to invest in the growth of our business, bringing critical newness and to return significant capital to shareholders. Last year, we returned nearly $200 million to shareholders, and we have returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders over the last three years. This morning, we announced a $200 million increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total remaining availability to approximately $850 million.', ""This is higher than the outstanding conversion market value of the LGP preferred shares. We believe share buybacks remain a very attractive use of capital for our shareholders. We also announced a 26% increase in our common dividend to $0.29 this quarter, our third consecutive year growing our dividend, which even after this increase represents less than 10% of our free cash flow in fiscal '24. Our strong free cash flow also strengthened our balance sheet."", ""We ended fiscal '24 with $2.5 billion in total liquidity, which is $1 billion above our target of $1.5 billion. This gives us the dry powder to handle both our $148 million unsecured notes that mature in June as well as the convertible preferreds that mature in November, while staying well within our liquidity goals. As a reminder, the convertible preferreds also represent approximately 15% of diluted common shares, which provides potential EPS upside to our fiscal '25 guidance and our midterm goals. We are in active discussions with our board and LGP on the best way to retire the preferred shares in fiscal '25, and we plan to give further updates as these discussions progress."", ""The third takeaway is that we believe Signet will see sequential same-store sales improvement throughout fiscal '25. One component is the return of engagements in the U.S. We saw industry engagement unit sales consistent with our expectations in the fourth quarter. And after a deceleration in January and early February, we saw notable improvement in the back half of February and March."", 'The milestones that we track show that the number of couples that have experienced more than 25 of the engagement milestones has increased 500 basis points since early 2023. We believe engagements in the U.S. should increase this year between 5% and 10%. This is a clear opportunity to attract new customers.', ""Signet provides tenured knowledge, known brands, consistent newness, and a full range of customization options. We believe the shape of this year's engagement growth will have a more material impact in the second half of the year, as customers continue to plan the majority of engagements around October through February. Our customer data platform now includes 17 million customers known to be in dating relationships, and we use this data to provide personalized marketing and education to attract engagement customers. After a customer's engagement ring sale, we look to build lifelong relationships as we'll be there for birthdays, anniversaries, and milestone occasions as well as providing the services to keep their jewelry collection protected and looking its best."", ""We will also continue to build brand equity, utilizing scale capabilities that will win new customers, including targeted personalized marketing. In fact, recently, we tested 28-day sprints of personalized marketing among Kay customers, and early results are driving a more than 10% revenue lift versus a control group. Over the last 6 years, we got smaller through fleet optimization to set ourselves up to get bigger. In fiscal '25, we will invest to grow strategically in markets where we see great returns, including a hometown market strategy for Kay, and to improve the shopping experience for our customers within our stores through renovations."", ""We are opening up to 30 new stores and renovating an additional 300 stores in order to drive brand relevance in our highest productivity doors. We've seen strong returns from these early investments of between 15% to 25% IRR. Services, which outperformed merchandise by more than 1,000 basis points for the fourth quarter remains a key area of growth in fiscal '25. We look to expand services further through B2B services with independents and insurance companies, where we offer exceptional value given our scale and breadth of service offerings."", ""We will also drive post-repair Extended Service Agreement or ESA offerings to customers who did not buy an ESA initially or are seeking repairs on a piece not purchased at Signet. Following our nearly 350 basis points increase in fiscal '24, we continue to see the opportunity to further improve attachment rates in fiscal '25, both in-store and online. Now I'll briefly comment on results so far for fiscal '25. Similar to Christmas, Valentine's Day shoppers were late and highly value motivated."", 'As a result, January and early February trend was quite soft, with comp sales down mid-teens. Since early February, trends have notably improved with same-store sales down mid- to high single digits. The core business continues to outperform with digital banners operational issues dragging comps down. We believe consumers will remain focused on value this year as they make important trade-offs in their budgets and our ability to bring newness and innovation will be a differentiator.', ""To summarize my comments today, I'd like to reiterate our three key takeaways. First, we delivered on our commitments again this quarter, including non-GAAP EPS above our high guide. Second, we generated over $600 million in pro forma free cash flow for the fourth year in a row. Our flywheel operating model is driving strong free cash conversion, which we're using to return capital to shareholders, improve our balance sheet, and invest in our business to drive growth."", ""And third, we believe we will see same-store sales improvement through fiscal '25 with same-store sales turning positive during the back half of the year in our core banners, driven by: engagement recovery; strengthened brand equities; product newness; and new customer acquisition, all while maintaining cost discipline. I'll now turn the call over to Joan."", 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was within our expectations at $2.5 billion, down 6% compared to the prior year. Same-store sales were down 9.6%, but improved to the third quarter. This reflects acceleration in Bridal and Fashion categories.', 'While December was our best same-store sales performance of the quarter, January was somewhat below expectations, driven in part by integration issues in our digital banners. Our engagement performance improved several hundred basis points compared to the third quarter, and our overall incidence of engagements were in line with our expectations, excluding digital banners. This quarter included a 53rd week, which generated $103 million in sales and was largely the difference between total sales and same-store sales decline. Our North America ATV for the quarter declined 60 basis points to last year and transactions were down roughly 7%.', 'The relatively flat performance in ATV is notable, compared to the more significant declines in AUR for independent jewelers due to their deep discounting. Our stable AUR during the quarter was driven by our assortment strategy, which provided our customers with several options to trade up through innovation and value engineering. Services grew 5% to last year, driven by an attachment rate that increased by nearly 350 basis points, reflecting newly implemented offerings like post-repair ESAs as well as point-of-sale prompting for our jewelry consultants. We delivered gross margin of $1.1 billion this quarter or over 43% of sales, with non-GAAP gross margins up 170 basis points to the prior year.', 'Merchandise margin also grew by 140 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, led by services and an increased mix in units and LCD merchandise. Turning to SG&A. Our non-GAAP expense of $670 million reflects 26.8% of sales, 70 basis points higher than last year as we deleveraged somewhat against fixed costs. However, this reflects meaningful improvement to prior quarters with cost savings near the high end of our expectations.', ""Our non-GAAP operating income was $410 million for the quarter or 16.4% of sales, delivering $5 million more than the prior year on lower revenue. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $6.73 per diluted share, up 22% from the prior year on higher operating income, higher net interest income and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year, we delivered $7.2 billion in sales, reflecting a 11.6% decline in same-store sales with gross margin of $2.8 billion or more than 39% of sales. This is up 30 basis points from fiscal '23 on a non-GAAP basis."", 'Reflecting a merchandise margin increase of 110 basis points, partially offset by deleveraging of fixed costs on a lower sales base. Non-GAAP SG&A for the year of $2.2 billion or 30.4% of sales was up to last year, largely due to the fixed cost portion of labor. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $643 million and resulted in a $10.37 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, with EPS above the high end of our expectations. Our GAAP EPS of $15.01 was positively impacted by a $263 million nonrecurring benefit or $4.88 per share from the impact of new tax legislation in Bermuda, which resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in Q4.', ""Due to this new legislation, beginning in fiscal '26 or a year from now, our effective tax rate on income in Bermuda will increase to a minimum of 15%, which is expected to increase our overall effective tax rate nearly 4%. This $263 million benefit also provides an offsetting impact on cash taxes owed over the next 10 years or roughly $26 million a year. This means our cash tax rate will be well below our effective tax rate. Our ending inventory of $1.9 billion was down 10% to the prior year, a larger reduction than year-over-year sales and down more than $600 million compared to pre-pandemic, excluding acquisitions; and including memo inventory, it was down more than $1 billion in our core businesses."", 'We continue to focus on life cycle management, taking markdowns earlier when merchandise performance does not meet our turn expectations, in order to capture more margin before SKUs reach clearance. We continue to see opportunity in optimizing our inventory, particularly as we lean into AI to drive assortments at the store level. These efficiencies translate directly to cash flow and higher margins. We ended the year with inventory turns of 1.4 times, in line with the prior year.', 'Turning to leverage. Gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of negative 0.7 times as our cash of $1.4 billion exceeded approximately $800 million of outstanding debt. We continue to grow confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow each year, driven by our flexible operating model and continued efficiencies. As we look forward into the year and the maturities ahead of us, we are reducing our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target down by 0.25 turns to be at or below 2.5 times.', ""And we are introducing a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA target of at or below 1.25 times, which would imply net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 0.5 times at the end of fiscal '25. This year, our unsecured notes mature in June and our convertible preferred shares mature in November. Our fortress balance sheet and strong liquidity and cash conversion allow us to address these maturities in full, and further debt issuances would be done opportunistically. Turning to real estate."", ""Last year, we closed 114 locations, mostly comprised of lower performing mall locations and U.K. stores. We ended the year with roughly 2,700 locations across our banners down more than 500 stores from fiscal '20. Our end store count also reflects the sale in November of 15 prestige watch locations in the U.K., for an accretive multiple to continue our focus on our core higher-margin jewelry business, as well as two additional locations subsequent to that transaction, including one in February."", ""Based on the strong performances we've seen up-tiering Jared, Diamonds Direct new stores, and the Kay new and remodeled stores, we plan to increase our investments in our fleet. In total, we expect approximately $160 million to $180 million in capital expenditures this year, including 20 to 30 new stores and renovating approximately 300 locations, including 200 in Kay stores, 50 Jared locations, and 6 Diamonds Direct stores to enhance the customer experience. We also expect to invest $40 million to $50 million in digital and technology in support of our consumers and team member experiences. Turning to guidance."", ""Looking to the first quarter, we expect total sales in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion, with same-store sales down between 11% and 7%, including a 2-point negative impact from our digital banner issues mentioned earlier. As a result of modest fleet optimization and luxury watch store sales, returning to a 52-week fiscal year and as a generally popular investor request, we are reintroducing same-store sales guidance. Early Valentine's Day shopping was down mid-teens, consistent with January performance. Since Valentine's Day, same-store sales have improved notably up 2 to 3 points to the fourth quarter and a further point when excluding our digital banners."", 'We forecast that the number of engagements in the U.S. will be down low- to mid-single digits in the first quarter of the year. We expect non-GAAP operating income between $40 million and $60 million. We are also introducing adjusted EBITDA guidance this year upon request from investors.', ""In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $87 million to $107 million. We expect flat-to-modest improvement in gross margins in the first quarter, while deleveraging in SG&A on lower same-store sales. For the year, we expect fiscal '25 total sales in the range of $6.66 billion to $7.02 billion. We expect a range of down 4.5% to up 0.5% for same-store sales this year, including a 1.5% to 2% drag from our digital banners and an approximately negative 0.5% impact from the negative halo of our Ernest Jones banner in the U.K."", ""We believe our core banners will continue to outperform with same-store sales approximately flat at the midpoint for the year, we expect to resolve the issues in our digital banners in the second half of the year, but it is not reflected as such in guidance. These issues are solely related to the James Allen and Blue Nile integration, and are not tied to, nor are they impacting the e-commerce channels of our core banners, which are performing well. We believe consumers will continue to be impacted by the elevated inflation over the last two years in fiscal '25. Consumers continue to focus on value in the current environment, and our new items will be focused on price points that appeal to consumers across a variety of demographics."", ""We also anticipate continued elevated promotions among independent jewelers this year. We expect engagement activity to be up 5% to 10% for the U.S. in fiscal '25. As such, we expect our same-store sales to improve as the year progresses."", ""Our guidance range assumes a fairly similar three-year same-store sales stack in Q1 and for the full year. We are also cycling off a 53rd week that was over $100 million, $75 million in the U.K. from selling 17 prestige watch locations, and closing up to 30 Ernest Jones locations, and another $50 million from total closures in FY '24 and fiscal '25. Net of new store openings, we expect our overall net square footage to be flat or to decline slightly."", 'The closures of the Ernest Jones locations in the U.K. is part of our efforts to rightsize that banner and shift sales to digital and other locations. We are also streamlining our overhead in the U.K. and expect to achieve margins in line with the rest of the company within three years.', ""Fiscal '25 non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $590 million to $675 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $780 million to $865 million, with modest non-GAAP operating margin expansion. This reflects cost savings of $150 million to $180 million this year from a new 3-year initiative to drive $350 million in costs out of the system, leveraging AI, streamlining noncustomer-facing expenses in addition to increasing sourcing efficiency. We expect cost savings to be more impactful in the second half of the year as we see the benefit from sourcing savings and inventory turn. We expect modest deleverage in SG&A from the reset of incentive compensation and investments in e-commerce channels and customer and team member experiences, offset by gross margin expansion."", 'Full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $9.08 to $10.48. Importantly, our EPS estimates for the year assumes the dilution of the preferred shares for the entire fiscal year. As I close my comments today, I want to thank our talented Signet team members, their passion for our millions of new and loyal customers and their dedication to ongoing consumer-inspired innovation resolved in an unrivaled experience in our industry. Our team is why we have excellent Net Promoter Scores, both online and in our stores.', ""I'll now open it up for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Your line is open.', 'Brandon Cheatham -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Hey, everyone. Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I wanted to dig in on what you're seeing on the engagement side to update your forecast. Now, you're looking for 5% to 10% increase for the year versus what I think was a 10% increase previously."", 'Just wondering, can you walk us through the progression as the year continues? And does that assume an acceleration in 4Q? Does 4Q end up higher than 10% to get there?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hi, Brandon. Thanks for your questions. So we're seeing engagements recover as we expected they would. We saw the trough happen in Q4, and we're expecting, as you'll recall, a gradual and incremental improvement in engagement trends over the next three years."", ""So it takes a bit to recover. We've also continued to see progress on the 45 milestones that we track. We have statistically significant data that shows us that once a couple has experienced a certain number of the proprietary milestones that we've identified, and that number being 25, they're much more likely; statistically, significantly, and likely, in fact, to get engaged, and that's up 500 basis points versus just a year ago. So we expect engagements to strengthen as fiscal year '25 progresses."", ""We think it's 5% on the low side of our guide, 10% on the high side of our guide for the fiscal year, but that will naturally be back-weighted. And that has to do with both the gradual recovery as well as the seasonality of engagements. More couples tend to get engaged in the October to February time frame. So it will likely be more back-weighted."", 'Brandon Cheatham -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Got it. And I was wondering, could you quantify the ticket and transactions that you saw, particularly in the first half of February, and where those metrics are now? And did you see pressure in any particular segment, Bridal or Fashion? And is there incremental pressure that you weren't expecting on the high end?"", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So I think if we go back to Q4 and we don't quantify all the tickets. But one of the things that we were proud of how our team executed in the fourth quarter was maintaining a stable average transaction value, despite significant discounting from independent jewelers, especially on lab-created, that was in Bridal and in Fashion. So that did put some pressure on average transaction value, but because we brought so much newness, which sold through so well and we value engineer that newness to provide an exceptional value, we were able to hold. Those trends of independent deep discounting have pretty much continued into the first quarter, I would say."", 'And I think what we saw in the jewelry category in January and early February was pretty similar to the rest of retail. It was a low-traffic time and a challenged consumer.', 'Brandon Cheatham -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks and good luck.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Lorraine Hutchinson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the engagement discussion. You did talk about unit sales consistent with expectations for engagement in the fourth quarter.', 'Was there some softness in pricing versus your expectations? And then, how has that competitive landscape been included in the guidance for this coming year?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So the reason -- Lorraine, the reason that we talk about units is because we're thinking about the number of couples getting engaged. And that, like I said, has been recovering very consistently to what we thought. Similar to my answer to Brandon, we have seen some pressure on average transaction value, both in Bridal and in Fashion, particularly driven by deep discounting among independent jewelers. You'll remember, they didn't predict the engagement trough as well as we did."", ""And so, we're over-inventoried all year. They were working through that inventory still in the fourth quarter, and so a lot of pressure on moving that through. I think that, while we have seen their continued discounting into the first quarter, I would anticipate that the inventories are recovering somewhat, and so that could be a help. I also think that consumers are becoming more aware that lab-created diamond prices are falling."", ""And so while they might be great for Fashion jewelry, there's something very, very rare and individual about a natural diamond. And so we think that that is a potential tailwind for natural diamonds in the year ahead."", 'Lorraine Hutchinson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'And then, can you talk -- give us some of your insights on the competitive landscape on the non-Bridal business? And what your expectations are for that this year?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. So the part of the category overall that has been performing the best is low-priced Fashion jewelry. So Banter, our value banner competes in that space, H.Samuel and the U.K. competes in that space.', 'But overall, we have reasonably low exposure to very low-priced Fashion jewelry. The place where we think we have an opportunity, in particular, is in gold, where we have some sourcing advantages and direct partnerships with factories to really value engineer jewelry, also bringing lab-created into Fashion proved to be a good strategy for us over the holidays. And our newness was well-positioned to trade customers up into price points that we do uniquely carry over the holidays. We have a 700 basis point improvement in how our new items sold through over holiday by pursuing that strategy.', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I would just add on to that, the idea of newness and the green shoots that we saw on holiday, particularly in Fashion and in our new Bridal offerings. Our intention and included within the guidance that we've given for FY '25 is a higher complement of newness, based on the run rate and testing that we saw in the holiday selling period, Lorraine."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, maybe for Joan, embedded -- well, first of all, on the gross margin line, I think you commented it to be slightly up in 1Q, on that kind of negative comp, that's pretty impressive. Can you kind of just walk us through the headwinds -- the moving pieces on gross in the first quarter? And how you're able to kind of sustain that?"", 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ike. So our first quarter continues with the sourcing savings and sourcing efficiencies that we've been able to work with our vendors and work with our sourcing team to provide. And what's really important in the margin equation is newness."", ""And so, we are bringing in more newness as I just mentioned. And we expect throughout the year that the margin improvement will be more back-half weighted as part of our cost savings program because the newness coming in and the incremental newness will turn, and we'll see more of that happen throughout the year, largely related to the back-half. So sourcing is a big opportunity. I would also say our disciplined inventory management."", ""Our teams have done an amazing job of being nimble and synchronizing our inventory position to demand and trends. And so we are not -- we are in a position where we are not over-inventoried, particularly in clearance or sell down. And so we're able to manage a leaner mark earlier before product goes to clearance. So I would say inventory management is another key component."", ""And then while we face the promotional discounting that we're seeing in the industry, we've also been able to target pricing within specific areas within our product base. So we're not -- it's not a broad-based discounting or promotional posture that we have. So those are the levers that we're using to continue to drive gross margin as an opportunity for us in Q1 as well as fiscal '25."", 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'And then, Joan, you had mentioned you expect margin improvement to be more 2H weighted. Is that just operating margin? Are you saying that gross margins could also improve year over year as you move into the back half?', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Goes margin. Yes, gross margin will improve. The sourcing savings as we roll or turn our inventory, last year it was 1.4 times and sourcing newness comes in and the sell-through largely will occur more back half on the new items.', 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then just to stick with the gross margin. I think your total revenue plan is like down two to seven. Can you tell us just high level, like what is your services expectation? I assume you outgrow that number, but is there a number you can share with us for the year that you're planning?"", 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Not specifically on services, but what I would tell you is we continue to implement new tools and opportunities within the services business. We mentioned a couple on the call that are wraparound opportunities. So POS prompts for our jewelry consultants is rolled out to all of our banners as well as post-repair ESA, which is something that we've been ramping up and we see traction. Our stores team has done a great job in training and really understanding the benefit to our customer for those services as a one-stop for all of their jewelry needs."", ""So we continue to evolve that. Our attachment rates as another note on that to consider, Ike, is attachment rates to Bridal are much higher than Fashion, they're almost double. And as with the return to engagements and as we see that scale up and progress throughout the year, we would expect the services business to respond similarly as well. So a lot of great opportunity in services for us."", 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""OK. So it sounds like service will outperform, but we're not -- you're not going to quantify the exact amount that you're planning to that?"", 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""No. We don't quantify the exact, but we expect it to continue to grow. And it did outperform our merchandise by 1,000 bps in the fourth quarter."", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Great point.', 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Understood. And sorry, last question. Just on the tax rate comment, Joan, you went through you talked about the step up like 3 or 4 points. Is that incorporated in this new 19 to 20 that you have this year? Or should we -- are you saying that we should be expecting like 23% to 24% going forward in the out years?', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So thank you for the clarification, Ike. The impact for the new tax legislation for Bermuda will affect FY '26, not FY '25. There was no impact in FY '25. We recorded the deferred tax benefit at the end of the year, and it does affect -- it will affect tax rate a year from now."", 'And associated with that is a cash tax benefit that will occur ratably over the next 10 years.', 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Got it. So '23, '24 as the go-forward based on what you said earlier, right?"", 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""FY '26."", 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Correct.', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""It starts at '23, '24. Yes. Yes."", 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much.', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yep. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mauricio Serna from UBS. Your line is open.', 'Mauricio Serna -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just wanted to get a sense of what are you thinking about the total jewelry industry growth considering also like Fashion and the nonengagement part of Bridal.', ""How are you thinking about the industry growth for the year? And then, just also maybe you could provide a little bit more details on the digital part of the business. Can you elaborate a little bit more like what are the issues happening in there? What -- if I recall, I think you were already expecting some benefits in Q4 of integration from both banners. And then lastly, just on the comment -- based on the commentary that you provided for Valentine's and how things have trended since then? Like is there a way to get a sense of like what are the quarter-to-date comps?"", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hi, Mauricio. So I'll start on your questions, and then Joan can chime in on that. So in terms of what we're expecting from the category in this year ahead, we're expecting the jewelry category to be down mid-single digits. We'd expect to be able to grow share in that environment, particularly in Bridal."", ""We're seeing consumers continue to be value-oriented. That's how they were at Q4 and Valentine's Day, a late shopper, highly focused on value. Our strategy that worked in Q4 was: first, to leverage our industry-leading banner portfolio to appeal to customers across all price points; second, to bring more newness and innovation in a tougher economy, customers still get excited by things they haven't seen before by innovative new items and we value engineer that newness to offer an especially good value without the level of heavy discounting that we saw in the category; and finally, we believe we are positioned to win as engagements return because of our tenured store teams, our well-known brands, trust is a more important factor in the engagement ring purchase, and we're using proprietary data. I mentioned in my remarks that we -- our customer data platform today includes 17 million people who are in dating relationships, we would expect only 2.5 million or so of those to get engaged in the next year or so."", ""So we have more than enough people in our proprietary database to really be talking to those pre-engagement customers in advance. So that's kind of what we see coming in the market and why we think we're positioned to perform better than the industry in this environment. Your second question was about digital banners. And so, the first thing I want to start with is just emphasizing that the issues that we saw were not to do with our core e-commerce business."", ""It was Blue Nile and James Allen as a result of the integration. Our core e-com business is performing well and the investments that we've put in place have led us to hit an all-time high in Net Promoter Score in digital. What we saw with James Allen and Blue Nile were some operational issues related to the replatforming of the business. Frankly, we thought we had it all wired and that the pipes were connected well, but they weren't."", ""And we had, unfortunately, some problems integrating Blue Nile with its production partners, which caused us to see a dip in conversion with much longer fulfillment times. So, we've got the team very focused on getting this fixed. We believe that we are on a very good path to get these issues resolved. We expect the fixes in place later during the year, although our guidance does not reflect significant improvement in the digital banners."", 'In fact, our fiscal year guidance assumes a 2-point comp drag in total coming from the digital banners.', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Then, Mauricio, with respect to your comp question, as we mentioned, early V Day or Valentine's Day was down mid-teens. Post Valentine's Day, we're seeing a down -- mid- to high single-digit comp, and if it helps to put the year in context for you. Our first half of FY '25 same-store sales range should be down high-single to mid-single digits, followed by a second half of down slightly to low single-digit growth. That's how to put the year in context."", 'Mauricio Serna -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Very helpful. And very lastly, a follow-up on the cost savings initiative. Any way you could break it down like into the three big buckets that you mentioned on the sourcing, the AI and others like the noncustomer-facing expenses?', 'Joan Hilson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So as we think about the $350 million, we expect or anticipate $150 million to $180 million this year in cost savings. It's through sourcing savings is roughly half of that is, I would say, for this year and would look for that to continue into the out years with that sort of balance. And then the AI and customer facing -- noncustomer-facing expenses would be the other half of that savings."", 'And again, as I mentioned, the sourcing savings would be more back-half weighted.', 'Mauricio Serna -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Very helpful. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.', 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the 300 renovations you're planning this year. That's, I think, about 10% of your store fleet."", 'Can you outline the benefits you would expect this year or if this is a later-year benefit? And any feedback on what you think the improvement in store sales volumes would be from those remodels?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Jim. We're excited about this program. We've been able to test within our Kay stores, which I mentioned were largely -- were roughly 200 stores and consistent with Hometown strategy for Kay, the renovations have delivered a mid-single-digit lift for us, and we call them renovation lights, which means from a capital perspective, it's very efficient."", ""And what they include are: new carpet, LED lighting, really supporting the sustainability and environment strategies that we have in goals. We'll take care of expanding services, which again, as we talked with Ike is a significant investment for us overall and drive top-line growth. And then will affect the cases, the lighting in cases and really upgrade the presence of the shopping environment for our jewelry consultants as well as our customers. And then we'll include digital displays as well as basic loss prevention updates."", ""So as you can see, it's capital light, but it's delivering top-line growth for us. And there's a store in Texas that we've done this work on, and we're really pleased with the response from our store team as well as the customer. I would also note that Jared stores, I mentioned this, that we're up-tiering Jared -- the assortment, we've tested different layouts and different design within the Jared banner. We're investing in 50 stores, and we're very excited about that."", ""That has an overall lift that's in excess of 10% on the top line. The IRR on it is 18% to 22%. And we feel that it better supports the tiering up of the assortment -- and then we're seeing a very nice sell-through on newness in that assortment, too. And it's a holistic upgrade for us because we're also increasing inventory toward the new assortment in the Jared banner."", ""We're also testing different formats in other banners such as Banter, which Gina mentioned performed very well at holiday, and we're looking to improve services and increase the services level of business in the Banter portfolio. And we believe that those investments will -- the tests, we'll read, we'll play out, and we'll put investments against a strong test rate."", 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', ""Is -- are the benefits primarily to be -- to take place next year. So this isn't really a fiscal 2025 story? Or is part of that baked into your expectations?"", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's a back half story. We have to invest upfront here, it will take us probably through to the end of the third quarter to address all the stores that we have targeted. So yes, definitely later in the year."", 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', ""OK. And you mentioned a comment about some fixed costs slightly higher on a year-over-year basis. I'm just wondering what is your outlook on labor inflation? And not only just inflation, but perhaps investment in labor as you grow going forward?"", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. We feel very strongly about investing in training, especially within our store teams, we have to -- we've provided for that in our guidance and in our investments for FY '25. So very cognizant of that, and we believe it's very important to do that outside the store, take our jewelry consultants and give them a right training environment that enables them to really gain full benefit and come back and train the balance of stores and so forth. So a very important investment for us."", ""Inflation itself is included within our guidance for FY '25. We've done through our cost savings program. We have made every effort to offset inflation as we give our guidance throughout the -- for the year, and we're very keen on making sure that we reach out indirect procurement, noncustomer-facing costs that we protect marketing and our people and really drive out the cost that the customers don't -- that the customer doesn't see nor do they care about."", 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', 'OK. OK. I have one last question, just talking more broadly about the shift to growth in the engagement category. Is there anything in your data set that helps us understand the opportunity for average transaction value to increase or if the engagement consumer is perhaps more value-oriented or frugal, hoping to invest in other parts of the wedding ceremony or engagement process.', ""Just any feedback there based on what you're looking at?"", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So what we know about engagement customers is that they really think about this purchase as a long-term purchase. It's often the most expensive purchase that a couple has ever made together, and they really wanted to represent more than just a piece of jewelry. It's representing their declaration of love to each other for a lifetime. So they tend to think in terms of a budget, which tends to be based on income."", 'And so what they can get for that budget is generally what we see them asking for. We have -- at this point in time, I would say, a group of customers who come in definitely wanting to spend that budget on a natural diamond, because they believe that it has more potential to retain its value over time. We see some customers coming and wanting a lab-created because they have realized that they can get a bigger carat size for their same budget. And then we have some customers, the biggest percentage who come in looking for the advice of our expert jewelry consultants to really help them make that choice.', 'But it tends to be a more fixed budget kind of a situation as opposed to a value orientation, which is what we do see on Fashion. So Fashion tends to fluctuate a bit more with -- the macroeconomic environment.', 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', 'You mentioned lab-grown diamonds. Is your assortment, do you expect to expand that assortment in Bridal for lab grown for the back half of the year?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""We've been very intent on following the customer and being customer-inspired with our inventory. What I could tell you is that lab-created still remains in the teens percentage of jewelry sales overall. For us, it tends to be a little bit lower than the category, especially given that we're skewing more to Bridal and a little bit less to low-priced Fashion. So we offer it, and it's been a good opportunity for some more value-oriented customers to get more for their limited budget."", ""But I think, we'll continue to be very consumer-inspired on that front and make sure that we have a great offering of any kind of engagement ring or fashion product that customers are looking for across our banner portfolio."", 'Jim Sanderson -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst', ""Very good. Thank you very much. I'll pass along."", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jim.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.', 'Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning, everyone. As you think about the Services business, what impact on the merch margin is that having? How you're planning the Services business this year compared to last year? And anything of how you're planning in the first quarter in light of the first quarter guidance. And then when you think about the store openings that you're doing, I think, 20 to 30."", 'Malls, out of malls, where are they going to be? And then you had closed some stores overseas. Is there a further store closing program that you anticipate there?', 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So thanks, Dana. Services is a growth opportunity for us. We mentioned that it outperformed merchandise margin or merchandise sales by 1,000 basis points, and it's really -- it carries a 20-point higher margin for us compared to merchandise margins. So it's definitely a gross margin expander as well as a top line growth driver for us."", ""So we expect it to continue to outpace merchandise sales within Q1 as well as for fiscal '25 -- for the full year. And our new -- the new programs that are -- the wraparound that I mentioned earlier, post-repair ESA, POS comps and so forth, are very engaging for the jewelry consultant to have an opportunity to basically ask the customer, the question, would you like to hear about the benefits of these packages for warranties as well as repairs. So I believe that, that's a continued driver. With respect to stores, the 20 to 30 store openings that we're looking forward to -- are largely off-mall."", ""We believe that when we look at the performance that we've seen over the past year Dana, off-mall has outperformed our mall stores as well as outlet has outperformed our mall stores. So we're continuing to drive on the economics of an off-mall -- of off-mall opportunities for us. So we'll continue on that. We also -- for the U.K., we've closed -- we sold the Ernest Jones locations that we mentioned, and we also will be closing more of the Ernest Jones stores focusing on jewelry, largely in the H.Samuel."", ""That's also H.Samuel banner. It's also a great story on real estate and refits renovations for the H.Samuel. We're seeing the new store format there, be very positive for the performance of the U.K. International segment."", ""So we'll continue to keep our eye on that and invest somewhat in the H.Samuel, but continue to close on the Ernest Jones locations."", 'Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to turn it back to Gina Drosos, chief executive officer, for closing comments."", 'Gina Drosos -- Chief Executive Officer', ""In closing, I'd like to take a moment to thank Todd Stitzer for his service as chair to Signet's board of directors. Todd will complete his 12-year term in June and will roll off our board in accordance with Signet's board tenure requirements. I know, I speak for the entire board when I say we are so grateful for Todd's leadership and vision. We have transformed Signet into a data-driven, digitally focused, and consumer-inspired company."", ""And Todd's trusted guidance unwavering support and smart counsel have been an invaluable asset. Helen McCluskey will take over as chair in the coming months.

Further down the income statement, Signet's selling, general, and administrative expenses rose 60 basis points to 26.9% of sales."", 'Adjusted operating income rose 1.2% to $409.7 million, giving Signet an operating margin of 16.4% in the seasonally strong quarter. On the bottom line, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.73, which was ahead of $5.52 in the quarter a year ago, though the latest result was boosted by a tax benefit equivalent to $0.38 per share. Analysts had expected $6.37 in EPS, meaning Signet essentially matched the consensus estimate when excluding the tax benefit.', '""As we look to Fiscal 2025, we are expecting sequential same-store sales improvement over the year as engagements gradually recover,"" said CEO Virginia Drosos in the earnings release.', 'The company also raised its dividend by 26% to $0.29 a quarter, which at current share prices gives it a dividend yield of 1.3%.', ""Investors were also disappointed with the company's guidance, as the recovery from engagements is expected to be weighted toward the back half of the fiscal year.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Signet Jewelers'  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Signet Jewelers is:', '21% = US$462m ÷ US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Signet Jewelers seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 21%. This certainly adds some context to Signet Jewelers' exceptional 58% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Signet Jewelers' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 26% in the same period, which is great to see."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is SIG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SIG is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Signet Jewelers' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 7.4%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 93% of its profits. So it looks like Signet Jewelers is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", ""Besides, Signet Jewelers has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.6% over the next three years. However, Signet Jewelers' future ROE is expected to rise to 27% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE."", ""On the whole, we feel that Signet Jewelers' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

That's putting it lightly as the shares are trading at levels they haven't seen since the previous millennium.

Could now, after the company has made multiple adjustments, be an optimal time to take a contrarian stance and assume that it may have finally bottomed out? Or is Walgreens a stock that's still too risky to invest in?"", ""One thing that has always troubled me about Walgreens as an investment and that has prevented me from wanting to own the stock is that the business's fundamentals have never been all that strong. In retail, companies have to fight for customers and that puts pressure on margins. Even though Walgreens focuses more on the healthcare and pharmacy side of things, that hasn't made things any easier."", ""Over the past decade, Walgreens' gross margins have been shrinking and unsurprisingly, that hasn't done any favors for its profit margin, which has struggled to stay above even a few percentage points."", ""Walgreens' low-margin business is problematic because without the massive volume of an Amazon or Walmart, it can be incredibly difficult for it to turn a profit, which is necessary to pay its dividend and support its long-term growth objectives."", ""There is some reason for optimism that Walgreens can turn things around before it's too late. New CEO Tim Wentworth has shown he isn't afraid of making difficult decisions. At the start of the year, the company slashed its dividend. Previously, Walgreens had been growing its dividend for decades and abruptly putting an end to that wouldn't have been an easy choice to make. But it was necessary given the company's underwhelming financials."", ""Walgreens is also reportedly considering the sale of assets, including spinning off its Boots UK segment, which could generate billions in cash. Moves like that could bolster Walgreens' financial position and give it the resources necessary to build out its healthcare business, which includes the launch of hundreds of primary care clinics at its stores. But while selling assets will add to its cash flow, those are temporary measures that still don't fix the company's core problems relating to its low margins and modest volumes."", ""These are, however, still the early innings of what's likely to be a long and complex turnaround plan for the business; Wentworth only took over at Walgreens in October 2023. It could take a while, but there's some hope that with new management in charge, the company could be on a better path forward."", ""Walgreens is an intriguing healthcare stock to watch right now given the changes the business is undergoing. But whether the company can turn things around isn't yet clear."", ""I'd like to see Walgreens get much smaller and scale down significantly (i.e., decrease the number of locations it has) to get rid of a lot of overhead and reduce the number of items it carries to focus primarily on higher-margin products. By running a leaner operation, the business could be more likely to turn a profit and become a more sustainable investment."", ""Right now, Walgreens is still too big, and until the company drastically improves its margins and prospects for long-term profitability, this is a stock I'd stay away from right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

This significant move in the market reflects Wall Street traders' optimism about the prospect of the Fed adjusting its monetary policy in response to economic conditions. The Federal Reserve's indication of a potential shift in its approach to interest rates prompted a rally in short-term bonds, as investors reacted to the reassurance of forthcoming cuts. The central bank's communication, including the 'dot plot' which confirmed expectations of three rate cuts within the year, provided clarity to market participants and fueled confidence in future economic stability. This development comes amid ongoing global economic shifts, including challenges within China's property market, as highlighted by Bain Capital's assessment that there is no immediate solution to the issues faced. Despite these broader economic concerns, the Fed's decision to maintain rates unchanged while signaling potential cuts has injected optimism into financial markets. The rally in equities was widespread, with various sectors experiencing gains, particularly those that had previously underperformed, such as small-cap stocks. This suggests a broad-based confidence in the resilience of corporate profits, bolstered by the anticipated supportive monetary policy. Moreover, the outperformance of short-term Treasury bonds underscores the shifting sentiment among traders, who now anticipate the possibility of the Fed's initial rate adjustment occurring as early as June. This heightened expectation reflects a dynamic market response to evolving economic signals and central bank communications.

With the UK economy slipping into a technical recession at the end of 2023 due to various factors including a gas supply shock following the Ukraine crisis, the Bank of England is under pressure to support economic recovery. Economists are divided on the timing of rate cuts, with some suggesting a possible reduction as early as June, aligning with market expectations. Despite the encouraging inflation figures, policymakers remain cautious, with uncertainties surrounding the extent and timing of rate adjustments. The Bank's decision may hinge on further data, particularly on wage growth and services inflation, with some analysts suggesting a more prudent approach towards rate cuts, possibly in August.

Rising population growth, increased urbanization, and water scarcity are some of the modern-day issues that water supply systems currently encounter. The quality of water from these supply systems is a fundamental concern. At least 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water contaminated with fecal matter. A good water source doesn’t necessarily guarantee better drinking water. This is because water might even get contaminated while being transmitted through pipes or where sanitation is not properly maintained.', 'West and Central Africa continue to be significantly deprived of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene. As reported by UNICEF, more than a third of the total population in the region cannot access safe water. Alternatively, they consume contaminated and untreated water. The impact of these conditions is rather substantial, even resulting in gender inequalities since young African women and girls are primarily responsible for collecting drinking water. This water not being accessible on the premises further aggravates the inequality situation. Simultaneously, only less than 50% of the regional schools have access to water.', 'The consequences of unsafe drinking water for health are even worse. The African Region reported 95,763 cases of cholera and 2,317 deaths between November 2022 and January 2023. These cases were witnessed in countries including Burundi, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi, and Zambia. As reported by the United Nations, Africa is currently going through a water catastrophe. West and Central Africa tends to be one of the most water-insecure and climate-impacted regions globally.', ""The countries majorly affected by this water-related crisis are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia. One-third of children across these countries lack access to at least basic water at home. This has resulted in a huge death burden among African children. The severity of the situation is evident from the fact that two out of five children under the age of five who die around the world from water-related diseases belong to these countries. Environmental concerns for the region include dropping groundwater levels, temperatures rising higher than the global average, and scarce water supplies being contaminated by unpredictable patterns of rainfall."", 'Companies including Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.

And so that causes acceleration in growth rates."", ""On retail, I'd also throw out this expedited shipping, this faster and faster shipping that Amazon has been rolling out for a while for about a year now, actually.

The company's shares are down by 5% since Jan. 1. It has dealt with some issues lately, especially subpar financial results that have disappointed investors. Though Amgen remains one of the world's largest and most prominent drugmakers, its status alone isn't enough to make the stock a buy."", ""Let's look deeper into what's going on with the business to determine whether it is worth buying its shares today."", ""Last year, Amgen's total revenue increased by 7% year over year to $28.2 billion. While that's a decent performance for a biotech giant, some of that growth was due to the company's acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics for about $28 billion. The acquisition closed in early October but had time to contribute $954 million to Amgen's sales. Excluding that figure, Amgen's total revenue rose by 3.5% year over year, which isn't particularly impressive."", ""Amgen has been dealing with competition for some of its medicines. The key will be to develop newer drugs. Amgen is working on that goal, including in the highly exciting weight loss area. One of its most promising pipeline candidates is AMG133, which is currently undergoing phase 2 studies. In an article published in Nature -- arguably the world's top scientific journal -- the authors presented results from a phase 1 study for AMG133."", 'Not only did it help patients lose weight, but they were also able to keep the weight off for up to 150 days following the last dose of the medicine. Amgen plans on releasing results from phase 2 studies later this year. The anti-obesity drug market is projected to soar in the coming years, with the condition rising to worldwide epidemic levels. So there is plenty of space here for Amgen to carve out a niche for itself.', ""The biotech is also working on many other programs. Newer approvals like cancer medicine Lumakras and asthma therapy Tezspire are still seeking label expansions. Overall, Amgen has 29 programs in phase 3 studies and a dozen in phase 2. It should earn important approvals in the next few years. The company will also help its new subsidiary, Horizon Therapeutics. Horizon's most important asset, Tepezza, for treating thyroid eye disease (TED), hasn't been on the market that long. It was first approved in the U.S. in early 2020."", ""Though it is the only treatment on the market for TED, there is a lot of work to be done. Amgen thinks about 100,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Tepezza, with many more abroad. The company has the sales force and funds to make things happen that Horizon Therapeutics, a much smaller drugmaker, didn't have by itself. That's why the increased adoption of Tepezza among TED patients could be another meaningful growth driver for Amgen."", ""Despite experiencing unimpressive revenue and earnings growth, Amgen has maintained its dividend growth. The drugmaker has raised its payouts by 55.17% in the past five years. Clearly, management isn't too worried that a precarious financial situation will lead to the company having to decrease or suspend its dividends. Meanwhile, it offers a yield of 3.35%, much higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.47%, while its cash payout ratio remains reasonable at just under 62%.\xa0Amgen's dividend isn't in any danger."", ""The nature of Amgen's business -- that of developing and selling important drugs -- makes it so the company should continue delivering reasonably consistent results regardless of economic conditions, though it won't always blow investors away. That, along with Amgen's solid dividend, makes it an excellent defensive stock. Investors looking for a reliable passive-income machine need look no further; Amgen fits the bill.

Now that's nearly a 20% rise in a little over just five months. Since those October 2023 lows. But there's been a divergence in how to play commodities amid persistent inflation."", ""Central banks have been purchasing more gold while ETF investors are looking at rising real interest rates and selling gold. As part of our ETF strategy brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Let's bring in Robert Miltner. Aberdeen director of ETF investment strategy. To discuss the smartest ways to invest in the precious metal trade."", ""Thank you for joining me in this morning. So first as we look at what we've seen with gold prices here, and we're looking at that inverse relationship that we typically see with treasuries and gold. How should people be looking at investing via ETF in this space?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So the story really has always been that investors trade gold based off of real interest rates. And so as real interest rates minus inflation rise, gold would tend to drop in price. So that is in fact, what ETF investors have been doing for the last two years. As real interest rates have risen. They've sold 750 tons across the industry of gold."", 'Which is a very large amount. And the only reason that gold prices are not lower than they are today, given all that selling is because there were two very large buyers in the market. One was the collective central banks which bought 2000 tons over the last two years. And more recently open interest has spiked higher from hedge fund and investing.', ""And that's just been recently in the last couple of weeks. So those two segments of the market have been buying and ETF investors continue to sell. They would tend to start to buy once we get a Fed funds rate cut. Actually come through."", ""- So Robert, so it sounds you don't necessarily think that the fundamentals support where gold prices have gone if it weren't for those two big buys that you were talking about? Wouldn't be the record that we saw last week. Where does it go from here then with the expectation that there could be a rate cut from the Fed come June?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So last three times that we reached this point of the Fed hiking cycle, which the last hike is already done. We're in the pause period of the cycle. Right before a cut and whether the cut happens in June or some other month this year it really doesn't matter much to us. The point is that the hikes are over and the next move is going to be a cut."", ""And when it occurs-- last three times that happened was in 2000 2008, 2000 2006 and 2018. And those last three times resulted in a 57% 235% and 69% rise in the price of gold. So past is not the future. However, that's how all the AI machine learning and trading systems work. So that has gold on our radar."", ""- And so as we look at some of the other things that are on your radar. I mean, you have to wonder if investors are perhaps either overlooking or undervaluing gold. As they perhaps look at some of these sexier things like they're seeing with NVIDIA and chips and other things. How should people be looking at allocating precious metals in their portfolio and some of the names you like?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So commodity cycles tend to run in a bit longer than the average investor thinks. So we look at data since 1870. And the average cycle is about 18 years. So when tend to be good times to increase commodity exposure from a very broad level without getting into all the fundamentals and miner activity, et cetera. And so there's really two events that can warrant increasing commodity exposure."", ""Very low physical inventories. There's not a lot of it around. That's true right now across a lot of the commodity spectrum. And the second thing is, very low or short money manager positioning to commodities. And that's very true now also. So with both of those true, it's really interesting to us and we heard a little bit of it from your prior guests. That there's increasing difficulty adding to commodity supplies from miners."", ""Due to environmental concerns, changing taxes, government regulation hurdles et cetera, that are changeable. And in addition, we're seeing a better outlook for the global economy and for commodities in particular. It's very exposed to the Chinese economy. So with this-- in this sort of a setup, we think commodities warrant a little bit closer attention. Particularly industrial exposed commodities and silver."", ""- So Robert, let's talk strategy. How do you put your money to work in the space?"", 'ROBERT MINTER: Here. So--', ""- You've got your eye on."", 'ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So with gold at or near all time highs and silver trading at a 50% discount to its all time high. Which occurred in 2011. Think silver is really interesting about 50% of demand for silver comes from industrial activities. And so we SIVR which is a silver ETF.', ""We also BCIM which is a Bloomberg industrial metals. Commodities Index. It's purely passive. Has large weighting to copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead. All the things that drive both the energy transition and the industrial economy.

Happy to be here.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I want to talk about this acquisition, first of all. You all acquiring CrownRock. It was announced back in December.', ""And of course, you're not the only one. We've seen this spate of acquisitions in the industry. What is this all about? What is the goal here in acquiring CrownRock?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: I think every company has their own set of goals for us. In the Permian Basin, we had a very large position in the Delaware. And that position was gave us the scale we need to bring the efficiencies of not just the proximity, but the size of what we're doing there."", 'So Delaware basin was fine. We wanted to apply the same model to the Midland basin. But we had a position that was pretty small in the Midland', 'Basin. So acquiring CrownRock gives us a little more scale. The scale also is in the right position. So it was a perfect fit with the assets that we already had.', 'And in addition, it brought with it an inventory. That actually helps to improve our inventory by fitting into tier one of the prospects that we have to drill in the future. So that was important.', ""And the other thing is it does bring forward cash flow. So part of the way we'll pay for some of the acquisition is to sell some of our oil and gas areas that are further out in terms of development and time. So this is an acceleration of value to our shareholders, improving our inventory, giving us the opportunity to become much more efficient in the Midland."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And how is the timeline looking for selling off those assets that you mentioned to help fund this transaction?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: Yeah, we expect to meet our timeline that we laid out. And that's 12 months past timeline for the initial phase. And then by 18 months, we'll have everything that we need to finalize what we want to do with the acquisition."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And should investors think of this. I mean, when you talk about scale, you're not just talking about scale, you're also talking about efficiency, you're talking about profitability of these various shale areas. So should investors think of this as a 1 plus 1 equals 2, or some exponential exponent of that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It'll be 1 plus 1 equals more than 2. Because with what we'll be able to do with the efficiencies that we create will create more value not only from that particular development, but again, it's the acceleration of value to the shareholders that from an NPV basis is much better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, I talked to one analyst after this transaction who talked about wondering if this is a sign Occidental is moving a little bit back towards a low shareholder return phase. And he was wondering when you'll get back to a sort of higher shareholder return phase. Can you talk to us about how you're thinking about that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: If the shareholder return that he's talking about is buybacks, then yes, we will in the near-term over the next couple of years, we'll continue to pay debt down. Post those two years, we'll get back to repurchasing shares. We've had a very healthy repurchase program over the last couple of years because of the fact that our stock right now is very undervalued in our view."", 'And so we think that the two important ways to return value to shareholders are through a growing dividend, which the CrownRock acquisition does for us and to repurchase shares. But also, we get a really good return on capital employed by investing organically in our oil and gas development. So those three things are the way that we can continue to create value for our shareholders.', 'JULIE HYMAN: I want to talk about another big project that you all are working on. And this is on the energy transition front direct air capture, which is effectively pulling CO2 out of the air and trying to bury it underground sequestering it. This is something that I believe Occidental fairly uniquely is doing in the oil and gas business.', ""Why did you decide to go that route versus capturing the CO2 that comes from the oil and gas processes? And what's the long-term outlook for this?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Well we've actually been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for more than 50 years. And so that's a core competence of us. We know how CO2 works."", 'We know how to manage it. We know how to deal with it. We have the infrastructure for it in the Permian Basin.', ""And so for a long time, we were trying to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industry. But that's a difficult process. Because when you're trying to get an industrial site to commit, to putting retrofitting equipment on their facility to capture carbon, that's not an easy negotiation. It's not an easy agreement to get to."", ""And quite frankly, we started back in 2008 trying to make that happen. We couldn't make it happen with anybody. And then we came across this Carbon Engineering technology to extract CO2 out of the atmosphere."", ""When we found that technology, that was more like the Holy Grail for us, because now we didn't have to talk to any emitters. All we had to do, and we controlled our own destiny with our schedule in terms of what pace we could develop these at and how well we could develop the direct air capture. And that allows us to do it when and where it makes sense to do."", ""And the other thing about that technology is that just so happens that it's potassium hydroxide that will extract the CO2 out of the air. We're the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the US, second largest in the world. And to make the mixing happen in the contact tower so that you get the most efficiency and pull the most CO2 out of the air."", 'You have to have the mixing happen in a good way. And PVC will help that will be the diffuser in the tower. And we make PVC, too. So not only did we have the synergy with our oil and gas business of having used CO2 in enhanced oil recovery, but also the synergies with the infrastructure that we have as a result of that and then the synergies with chemicals. And it was like this was meant for us to do.', ""JULIE HYMAN: When is it going to make money? What's the timeline? Because it's the economics of it. And not just with direct air capture, but with your rivals are doing. It's quite difficult."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Actually, we will have the first phase of Stratus which is our direct air capture facility that we're building in the Permian. That will be up starting up in mid next year. We've already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for that 500,000 tons per year that will ultimately have for that facility. And that's been going well."", 'There is a demand from airlines, from tech companies, and even from a consulting company and some others that want to reduce their carbon footprint. This is the voluntary compliance market. These are people who care about their carbon footprint, and who want to make a difference, want to offset that carbon footprint.', ""They're buying these credits. So we will have cash flow coming in from that facility."", 'JULIE HYMAN: When do you think it will pay for itself and actually get into the black?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: The payout really is dependent on what the credits are beyond what we've sold out today. We've done a really good job. And so we haven't sold them all."", ""But the cost of credits right now are going up because there's a limited number of reduction credits that companies can buy. So I hope to be able to tell you in two years exactly what that looks like. But it's evolving."", ""JULIE HYMAN: We'll check back in with you."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It's evolving and going well actually."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Vicki Hollub, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time here.', 'VICKI HOLLUB: Thank you.']"

Today you've got Brent briefly surpassing 86 bucks for the first time that we've seen that level since November. And you also have crude surpassing 80 just above 81 bucks a barrel.

He is RJ O'Brien's global market insights managing director. RJ, it's great to have you here. So we've seen this March to the upside ahead of CERAWeek. There is certainly a lot of focus on energy on transition on M&A, a number of the top themes that our colleague Julie Hyman was just talking about playing out within the energy space."", ""Talk to us just about this move higher that we've seen in prices and what that tells us about what's likely to come within the space?"", ""TOM FITZPATRICK: Thanks very much and thanks for having me. I think in terms of this move higher, one of the things we should always remember is that oil is an industrial commodity but it's also to a certain extent, a financial asset. And how it trades is not always a function totally of the supply and demand dynamics out in the economy. The classic example of that being 2007, 2008 when the oil price tripled in price."", ""But you certainly couldn't validate that there was a demand backdrop, which actually created that. So this move certainly, initially is very technical. We completed a bullish outside week on oil last week. And in fact on WTI, that's the second one in the last three weeks. But outside of that, you haven't seen this development since April of 2022. And when we got that in April 2022, oil ended up going significantly higher in the following eight weeks."", ""And we also posted this bullish outside week in Brent crude last week, which is the first one that we've actually seen on that since April 2022. So big technical developments and breaking out of the three month trading range and the weekly reversals suggest that we can continue to push higher. We have some good levels around 8350 on WTI and 89 on Brent. But if we get through those levels, then there could be a real danger that we could be pushing even further to topside towards 95 to 97."", ""And think what's going to be very important is figuring out the ultimate reasonings for this because the feedback loop depending on that can be very different."", 'BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Tom, I mean, we think back to April 2022. And remember what was happening that also influenced some of the price action there. It was geopolitical conflict. It was Russia Ukraine. Are we just one exogenous event away from seeing another massive spike in oil?', ""It's a valid point. But I mean, who knows what tail risks are out there. But sometimes price action tells you what we are susceptible to. And if there was a new event that would certainly suggest that given the way price action is already trading that the up move could accelerate to the top side. But with outside those events, I think we'd have to look at this and say that this doesn't necessarily indicate we'd see a move of that magnitude. And this doesn't come off the low of the trend either."", ""So it's not as an aggressive reversal as we would have seen then when oil was already moving down. Whereas we've already moved up about 20%. So it is important if we do get another event. But I would suggest that this dynamic that we're seeing at the moment is very much absent that event. And while it's been a good push of about 20% since December, it doesn't yet rise to the significance of what we saw back in 2022."", 'SEANA SMITH: Tom when we take a look at a lot of the M&A activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, record $144 billion worth of deals were signed for energy producers that was according to the latest data here from inverse. What does that tell us just about the setup then for 2024 and whether or not we could expect a further uptick in deals within the space.', ""I mean, at the end of the day at a minimum, what it tells you is that fossil fuels are not dead, the transition in terms of fossil fuels to alternative forms of energy, certainly been a main focus. But that takes time. That takes investment. And in a global economy where a lot of countries are already very stretched in terms of their fiscal position, you're already seeing a scenario where that may take a transition period longer than people had previously thought."", ""So as a consequence, you're sitting at an oil price that's back to where it was a year ago. You're sitting in an oil price that from an historic perspective, no it's not at the 2008 highs or not even at the highs, we saw after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But at 80, 85, 90, $95. It's certainly at very elevated levels compared to what we've seen on a multitude of occasions in the last 10 to 15 years."", ""And as I guess as a backdrop when people look at that. They look at the geopolitical tensions that Brad has talked about. They look at the underlying dynamic of the overall economy where we're probably producing as much as we can potentially produce. And they see where the oil price is. That feedback loop probably suggests to them that seems to be a very resilient commodity and therefore an area on that basis that's probably worth continuing to look at from an investment perspective."", ""BRAD SMITH: To what extent do you expect what we're monitoring within the oil market and Brent crude. Even for the assets and review over at BlackRock at the top end of their 2024 range at this juncture to what extent does this all pass into the Fed and what they're going to be discussing this weekend and moving forward?"", ""TOM FITZPATRICK: I think that's a hugely interesting topic because often people look at the oil price and they think oil price up. That's interest rates up. Oil price down, interest rates down. Inflation, disinflation. What's much more important and I think particularly for policymakers is to identify why the oil price is doing what it's doing. If you go back to 2022, when oil prices surged."", ""Let's not forget that oil prices were surging at the same time as we had the biggest fiscal and monetary stimulus in the history of mankind. At the same time when employment was picking up quite dramatically and the savings rate was growing exponentially due to that fiscal stimulus. So the economy was recovering, the amount of money and free money in the economy was abundant."", ""And therefore rising oil price was not really a drag. But fast forward to today if you do not believe that this oil price move is a function of some significant pick up in economic activity. And I would suggest looking at China, Japan, Europe out on the borders of Ossetian. US real growth high but nominal growth falling. It doesn't look like a very demand driven move. And therefore it's no different from a tax hike."", 'And you would not raise interest rates or you would not get more aggressive in terms of your monetary policy if prices were pushing higher because of a tax hike. So sure it has a danger of showing up in headline inflation. But with unemployment rising with the savings rate lower, with salary increases moderating. What it feels like a lot of people tapped out, this is far more likely to result in a substitution effect we already see very weak retail sales coming through.', ""And an underlying drag on the economy. So we've seen the ECB plenty of times in the past make the mistake of reacting to dynamics that were only due to a non demand driven move in the oil price. I don't think we will see the Fed do that. I think they will be looking through that dynamic because if anything this has the potential to be disinflationary at the core."", 'If it means that spending, which is not really discretionary in terms of oil, takes away from the ability for people to spend and at a time when mortgage rates are close to 7% and interest rates are much higher. So I think the Fed needs to be prepared to back from this and not be looking at this as something they should be reacting to at this point.', ""BRAD SMITH: Tom really great insights and analysis.

But NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) bucks the trend in a good way. The price of the stock is up 3,750% since 1980. That's a long time for sure, but long-term investors have benefited mightily from owning this millionaire-making utility."", ""The best part of the story, however, is that the stock is currently in a funk, and offering investors a historically attractive chance to buy. Here's what you need to know."", ""There are two parts to NextEra Energy's utility business. The first, which makes up around 70% of the company, is a fairly boring regulated utility. This is similar to what most utilities own, but there's a growth twist: NextEra Energy owns Florida Power & Light, the largest utility in the state of Florida. The Sunshine State has benefited from net population growth for years. More residents means more customers, and that leads to top-line growth for utilities."", ""The key to this business is that it is regulated. That means that NextEra Energy has a government-granted monopoly in the regions it serves, but it must get its rates and investment plans approved by regulators. Regulators focus on balancing reliable, cost-effective power access for customers against providing adequate returns for NextEra Energy. This business is generally a slow and steady grower, providing a solid foundation for NextEra Energy's other business."", ""The second big story here, at around 30% of the overall company, is NextEra Energy Resources. That's a pretty nondescript name for a business that counts itself as one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world. This is the company's growth engine. To put some numbers on that, NextEra Energy Resources currently has 36 gigawatts of generating capacity. Management is hoping to increase that by as much as 41.8 gigawatts by the end of 2026. In other words, the business could double in size."", ""Given the transition the world is making away from carbon-based energy and toward renewable and cleaner power sources, it seems likely that there's a long runway for growth here. That in turn should power earnings and dividend growth for years to come, maintaining NextEra Energy's status as an exciting growth and income play."", ""As the chart above shows, NextEra Energy's stock price is up massively over the long term. It has clearly helped make many shareholders rich over that span. But look at the tail end of the graph -- the stock has fallen notably from its highs. The reason for this is largely related to two factors."", ""First, interest rates have risen. That will increase the company's costs, but regulators are highly likely to adjust for that, as will the market-driven renewable power business. Given enough time, investment returns will recover. Second, Wall Street has broadly soured on the clean energy business after an initial period of what might best be described as over-exuberance. The transition to clean energy will likely take decades, however, so investors probably don't need to worry too much about this business suddenly becoming a dog."", ""The recent price drop, meanwhile, has pushed the dividend yield up to 3.4%. That's near the highest levels in a decade. Given that the dividend has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years and management is currently calling for roughly 10% annualized dividend increases through 2026, the historically high yield looks like a buying opportunity."", ""NextEra Energy isn't going to be a great fit for every investor -- the dividend yield might not be high enough for those focused on maximizing the income they generate, for example. However, if you are a growth investor or a growth and income investor, this utility has an incredible track record of making investors wealthy and a historically high yield.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?"", ""Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about NextEra Energy (NEE)."", 'NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.65, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.65 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70.6% and 5.9% of all recommendations.', 'Check price target & stock forecast for NextEra here>>>The ABR suggests buying NextEra, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is NEE a Good Investment?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $3.44.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for NextEra.

This resurgence is particularly beneficial for homebuilding companies, driven by factors comprising slightly more favorable mortgage rates and a shortage of existing houses for sale.', ""Despite challenges posed by higher mortgage rates, builders are adapting by implementing strategies such as price reductions and offering incentives to stimulate sales. Additionally, they are adjusting the size of homes being built to mitigate the impact of rising material costs. These measures not only support the industry's resilience but also present opportunities for homebuilding companies to thrive in the current market conditions."", 'According to Commerce Department data released on Mar 19, housing starts jumped 10.7% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.521 million units in February, beating the consensus estimate of 1.453 million units by 4.7%.

This reduction in rates is promising for individuals planning to purchase homes as the spring homebuying season commences.', 'Furthermore, the sentiment among homebuilders echoes this positive trend. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, recently published, indicates that homebuilder sentiment increased three points to 51 in March. This marks the fourth consecutive month of growth in sentiment among homebuilders.', 'However, with robust buyer demand persisting and the anticipation of more consumers entering the market amid declining mortgage rates, companies are likely to encounter obstacles linked to elevated building expenses.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) shareholders have enjoyed a 94% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 76% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 50% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Masco ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', ""Over half a decade, Masco managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Masco's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Masco's TSR for the last 5 years was 111%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""We're pleased to report that Masco shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 50% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Now that's nearly a 20% rise in a little over just five months. Since those October 2023 lows. But there's been a divergence in how to play commodities amid persistent inflation."", ""Central banks have been purchasing more gold while ETF investors are looking at rising real interest rates and selling gold. As part of our ETF strategy brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Let's bring in Robert Miltner. Aberdeen director of ETF investment strategy. To discuss the smartest ways to invest in the precious metal trade."", ""Thank you for joining me in this morning. So first as we look at what we've seen with gold prices here, and we're looking at that inverse relationship that we typically see with treasuries and gold. How should people be looking at investing via ETF in this space?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So the story really has always been that investors trade gold based off of real interest rates. And so as real interest rates minus inflation rise, gold would tend to drop in price. So that is in fact, what ETF investors have been doing for the last two years. As real interest rates have risen. They've sold 750 tons across the industry of gold."", 'Which is a very large amount. And the only reason that gold prices are not lower than they are today, given all that selling is because there were two very large buyers in the market. One was the collective central banks which bought 2000 tons over the last two years. And more recently open interest has spiked higher from hedge fund and investing.', ""And that's just been recently in the last couple of weeks. So those two segments of the market have been buying and ETF investors continue to sell. They would tend to start to buy once we get a Fed funds rate cut. Actually come through."", ""- So Robert, so it sounds you don't necessarily think that the fundamentals support where gold prices have gone if it weren't for those two big buys that you were talking about? Wouldn't be the record that we saw last week. Where does it go from here then with the expectation that there could be a rate cut from the Fed come June?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So last three times that we reached this point of the Fed hiking cycle, which the last hike is already done. We're in the pause period of the cycle. Right before a cut and whether the cut happens in June or some other month this year it really doesn't matter much to us. The point is that the hikes are over and the next move is going to be a cut."", ""And when it occurs-- last three times that happened was in 2000 2008, 2000 2006 and 2018. And those last three times resulted in a 57% 235% and 69% rise in the price of gold. So past is not the future. However, that's how all the AI machine learning and trading systems work. So that has gold on our radar."", ""- And so as we look at some of the other things that are on your radar. I mean, you have to wonder if investors are perhaps either overlooking or undervaluing gold. As they perhaps look at some of these sexier things like they're seeing with NVIDIA and chips and other things. How should people be looking at allocating precious metals in their portfolio and some of the names you like?"", ""ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So commodity cycles tend to run in a bit longer than the average investor thinks. So we look at data since 1870. And the average cycle is about 18 years. So when tend to be good times to increase commodity exposure from a very broad level without getting into all the fundamentals and miner activity, et cetera. And so there's really two events that can warrant increasing commodity exposure."", ""Very low physical inventories. There's not a lot of it around. That's true right now across a lot of the commodity spectrum. And the second thing is, very low or short money manager positioning to commodities. And that's very true now also. So with both of those true, it's really interesting to us and we heard a little bit of it from your prior guests. That there's increasing difficulty adding to commodity supplies from miners."", ""Due to environmental concerns, changing taxes, government regulation hurdles et cetera, that are changeable. And in addition, we're seeing a better outlook for the global economy and for commodities in particular. It's very exposed to the Chinese economy. So with this-- in this sort of a setup, we think commodities warrant a little bit closer attention. Particularly industrial exposed commodities and silver."", ""- So Robert, let's talk strategy. How do you put your money to work in the space?"", 'ROBERT MINTER: Here. So--', ""- You've got your eye on."", 'ROBERT MINTER: Sure. So with gold at or near all time highs and silver trading at a 50% discount to its all time high. Which occurred in 2011. Think silver is really interesting about 50% of demand for silver comes from industrial activities. And so we SIVR which is a silver ETF.', ""We also BCIM which is a Bloomberg industrial metals. Commodities Index. It's purely passive. Has large weighting to copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead. All the things that drive both the energy transition and the industrial economy. So we like both of those right now."", '- All right, Robert Minter Aberdeen director of ETF investment strategy. Appreciate you stopping by today.

What is the goal here in acquiring CrownRock?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: I think every company has their own set of goals for us. In the Permian Basin, we had a very large position in the Delaware. And that position was gave us the scale we need to bring the efficiencies of not just the proximity, but the size of what we're doing there."", 'So Delaware basin was fine. We wanted to apply the same model to the Midland basin. But we had a position that was pretty small in the Midland', 'Basin. So acquiring CrownRock gives us a little more scale. The scale also is in the right position. So it was a perfect fit with the assets that we already had.', 'And in addition, it brought with it an inventory. That actually helps to improve our inventory by fitting into tier one of the prospects that we have to drill in the future. So that was important.', ""And the other thing is it does bring forward cash flow. So part of the way we'll pay for some of the acquisition is to sell some of our oil and gas areas that are further out in terms of development and time. So this is an acceleration of value to our shareholders, improving our inventory, giving us the opportunity to become much more efficient in the Midland."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And how is the timeline looking for selling off those assets that you mentioned to help fund this transaction?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: Yeah, we expect to meet our timeline that we laid out. And that's 12 months past timeline for the initial phase. And then by 18 months, we'll have everything that we need to finalize what we want to do with the acquisition."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And should investors think of this. I mean, when you talk about scale, you're not just talking about scale, you're also talking about efficiency, you're talking about profitability of these various shale areas. So should investors think of this as a 1 plus 1 equals 2, or some exponential exponent of that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It'll be 1 plus 1 equals more than 2. Because with what we'll be able to do with the efficiencies that we create will create more value not only from that particular development, but again, it's the acceleration of value to the shareholders that from an NPV basis is much better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, I talked to one analyst after this transaction who talked about wondering if this is a sign Occidental is moving a little bit back towards a low shareholder return phase. And he was wondering when you'll get back to a sort of higher shareholder return phase. Can you talk to us about how you're thinking about that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: If the shareholder return that he's talking about is buybacks, then yes, we will in the near-term over the next couple of years, we'll continue to pay debt down. Post those two years, we'll get back to repurchasing shares. We've had a very healthy repurchase program over the last couple of years because of the fact that our stock right now is very undervalued in our view."", 'And so we think that the two important ways to return value to shareholders are through a growing dividend, which the CrownRock acquisition does for us and to repurchase shares. But also, we get a really good return on capital employed by investing organically in our oil and gas development. So those three things are the way that we can continue to create value for our shareholders.', 'JULIE HYMAN: I want to talk about another big project that you all are working on. And this is on the energy transition front direct air capture, which is effectively pulling CO2 out of the air and trying to bury it underground sequestering it. This is something that I believe Occidental fairly uniquely is doing in the oil and gas business.', ""Why did you decide to go that route versus capturing the CO2 that comes from the oil and gas processes? And what's the long-term outlook for this?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Well we've actually been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for more than 50 years. And so that's a core competence of us. We know how CO2 works."", 'We know how to manage it. We know how to deal with it. We have the infrastructure for it in the Permian Basin.', ""And so for a long time, we were trying to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industry. But that's a difficult process. Because when you're trying to get an industrial site to commit, to putting retrofitting equipment on their facility to capture carbon, that's not an easy negotiation. It's not an easy agreement to get to."", ""And quite frankly, we started back in 2008 trying to make that happen. We couldn't make it happen with anybody. And then we came across this Carbon Engineering technology to extract CO2 out of the atmosphere."", ""When we found that technology, that was more like the Holy Grail for us, because now we didn't have to talk to any emitters. All we had to do, and we controlled our own destiny with our schedule in terms of what pace we could develop these at and how well we could develop the direct air capture. And that allows us to do it when and where it makes sense to do."", ""And the other thing about that technology is that just so happens that it's potassium hydroxide that will extract the CO2 out of the air. We're the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the US, second largest in the world. And to make the mixing happen in the contact tower so that you get the most efficiency and pull the most CO2 out of the air."", 'You have to have the mixing happen in a good way. And PVC will help that will be the diffuser in the tower. And we make PVC, too. So not only did we have the synergy with our oil and gas business of having used CO2 in enhanced oil recovery, but also the synergies with the infrastructure that we have as a result of that and then the synergies with chemicals. And it was like this was meant for us to do.', ""JULIE HYMAN: When is it going to make money? What's the timeline? Because it's the economics of it. And not just with direct air capture, but with your rivals are doing. It's quite difficult."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Actually, we will have the first phase of Stratus which is our direct air capture facility that we're building in the Permian. That will be up starting up in mid next year. We've already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for that 500,000 tons per year that will ultimately have for that facility. And that's been going well."", 'There is a demand from airlines, from tech companies, and even from a consulting company and some others that want to reduce their carbon footprint. This is the voluntary compliance market. These are people who care about their carbon footprint, and who want to make a difference, want to offset that carbon footprint.', ""They're buying these credits. So we will have cash flow coming in from that facility."", 'JULIE HYMAN: When do you think it will pay for itself and actually get into the black?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: The payout really is dependent on what the credits are beyond what we've sold out today. We've done a really good job. And so we haven't sold them all."", ""But the cost of credits right now are going up because there's a limited number of reduction credits that companies can buy. So I hope to be able to tell you in two years exactly what that looks like. But it's evolving."", ""JULIE HYMAN: We'll check back in with you."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It's evolving and going well actually."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Vicki Hollub, thanks so much.

We have some good levels around 8350 on WTI and 89 on Brent. But if we get through those levels, then there could be a real danger that we could be pushing even further to topside towards 95 to 97."", ""And think what's going to be very important is figuring out the ultimate reasonings for this because the feedback loop depending on that can be very different."", 'BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Tom, I mean, we think back to April 2022. And remember what was happening that also influenced some of the price action there. It was geopolitical conflict. It was Russia Ukraine. Are we just one exogenous event away from seeing another massive spike in oil?', ""It's a valid point. But I mean, who knows what tail risks are out there. But sometimes price action tells you what we are susceptible to. And if there was a new event that would certainly suggest that given the way price action is already trading that the up move could accelerate to the top side. But with outside those events, I think we'd have to look at this and say that this doesn't necessarily indicate we'd see a move of that magnitude. And this doesn't come off the low of the trend either."", ""So it's not as an aggressive reversal as we would have seen then when oil was already moving down. Whereas we've already moved up about 20%. So it is important if we do get another event. But I would suggest that this dynamic that we're seeing at the moment is very much absent that event. And while it's been a good push of about 20% since December, it doesn't yet rise to the significance of what we saw back in 2022."", 'SEANA SMITH: Tom when we take a look at a lot of the M&A activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, record $144 billion worth of deals were signed for energy producers that was according to the latest data here from inverse. What does that tell us just about the setup then for 2024 and whether or not we could expect a further uptick in deals within the space.', ""I mean, at the end of the day at a minimum, what it tells you is that fossil fuels are not dead, the transition in terms of fossil fuels to alternative forms of energy, certainly been a main focus. But that takes time. That takes investment. And in a global economy where a lot of countries are already very stretched in terms of their fiscal position, you're already seeing a scenario where that may take a transition period longer than people had previously thought."", ""So as a consequence, you're sitting at an oil price that's back to where it was a year ago. You're sitting in an oil price that from an historic perspective, no it's not at the 2008 highs or not even at the highs, we saw after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But at 80, 85, 90, $95. It's certainly at very elevated levels compared to what we've seen on a multitude of occasions in the last 10 to 15 years."", ""And as I guess as a backdrop when people look at that. They look at the geopolitical tensions that Brad has talked about. They look at the underlying dynamic of the overall economy where we're probably producing as much as we can potentially produce. And they see where the oil price is. That feedback loop probably suggests to them that seems to be a very resilient commodity and therefore an area on that basis that's probably worth continuing to look at from an investment perspective."", ""BRAD SMITH: To what extent do you expect what we're monitoring within the oil market and Brent crude. Even for the assets and review over at BlackRock at the top end of their 2024 range at this juncture to what extent does this all pass into the Fed and what they're going to be discussing this weekend and moving forward?"", ""TOM FITZPATRICK: I think that's a hugely interesting topic because often people look at the oil price and they think oil price up. That's interest rates up. Oil price down, interest rates down. Inflation, disinflation. What's much more important and I think particularly for policymakers is to identify why the oil price is doing what it's doing. If you go back to 2022, when oil prices surged."", ""Let's not forget that oil prices were surging at the same time as we had the biggest fiscal and monetary stimulus in the history of mankind. At the same time when employment was picking up quite dramatically and the savings rate was growing exponentially due to that fiscal stimulus. So the economy was recovering, the amount of money and free money in the economy was abundant."", ""And therefore rising oil price was not really a drag. But fast forward to today if you do not believe that this oil price move is a function of some significant pick up in economic activity. And I would suggest looking at China, Japan, Europe out on the borders of Ossetian. US real growth high but nominal growth falling. It doesn't look like a very demand driven move. And therefore it's no different from a tax hike."", 'And you would not raise interest rates or you would not get more aggressive in terms of your monetary policy if prices were pushing higher because of a tax hike. So sure it has a danger of showing up in headline inflation. But with unemployment rising with the savings rate lower, with salary increases moderating. What it feels like a lot of people tapped out, this is far more likely to result in a substitution effect we already see very weak retail sales coming through.', ""And an underlying drag on the economy. So we've seen the ECB plenty of times in the past make the mistake of reacting to dynamics that were only due to a non demand driven move in the oil price. I don't think we will see the Fed do that. I think they will be looking through that dynamic because if anything this has the potential to be disinflationary at the core."", 'If it means that spending, which is not really discretionary in terms of oil, takes away from the ability for people to spend and at a time when mortgage rates are close to 7% and interest rates are much higher. So I think the Fed needs to be prepared to back from this and not be looking at this as something they should be reacting to at this point.', ""BRAD SMITH: Tom really great insights and analysis. Thanks so much for taking the time to have the conversation with us today. Tom Fitzpatrick, Andre O'Brien global market insights managing director. Appreciate it.""]"

So Inés talk about some of the action that we're seeing here in terms of a combination of production cuts and what the demand picture is looking like."", ""INES FERRE: Yeah, Rachelle. Well, let me start out with the International Energy Agency and OPEC don't agree on many things. But in this case, now the International Energy Agency is saying that there will be a deficit of oil this year. And part of that has to do with the OPEC plus production cuts which IEA anticipates will go through 2024. Right now those production cuts are set through the second quarter of this year for now."", ""So the IEA again revising its supply forecasts, now anticipating a deficit and the OPEC plus production cuts by the way are 2.2 million barrels per day. Also the IEA revised its global demand growth upwards to 1.3 million barrels per day. All of this to say is that these are revisions which are bullish for oil prices. We have seen oil running up in the last few days. We're looking at Brent crude that's right now trading above $85 a barrel."", ""We're also watching WTI that's around $81 a barrel, surpassing that $80 barrel a very psychological level for traders for the industry as well. We have seen attacks on Russian refineries. That is very much impacting supplies because those Russian customers have to go elsewhere in the world to get their supplies. So all of this boding, it's bullish for oil prices and we are now seeing year to date oil is up for Brent, 15% for WTI that is."", 'And for Brent crude prices also up about 12%.

The pandemic significantly disrupted its operations, initially leading to worse financial results than hoped. Various economic issues, including supply chain problems, have also affected Intuitive Surgical in the past half a decade. Still, the medical device specialist has delivered solid returns during this period.', ""Though Intuitive Surgical still has some challenges to deal with (more on that later), the company has all the makings of an outstanding stock to hold onto for a while. Let's find out why."", ""Intuitive Surgical develops robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) systems. The da Vinci system is the company's flagship product. Though these cost between $700,000 and $2.5 million, the medical device specialist makes most of its money from its instruments and accessories segment. The more procedures performed with its machine, the more instruments physicians need to order, and the higher the company's revenue."", ""Intuitive's top line should continue moving in the right direction as long as it expands its installed base, which it has been doing for a long time. It ended 2023 with 8,606 installed da Vinci systems, an increase of 14% year over year. Furthermore, a general rise in demand for the kinds of procedures done with the da Vinci system should also lead to higher revenue."", 'The da Vinci system is used to perform a range of surgeries, from hernia repairs to colon resection procedures. With an aging population, many of these operations will become much more common, a powerful tailwind from which Intuitive Surgical will benefit. The company has been riding the wave of the increased adoption of RAS for a while (the da Vinci system was first cleared in the U.S. in 2000), leading to excellent financial results. Can the medical device specialist keep it up?', ""Several things could get in Intuitive Surgical's way. Let's consider two of them. The first is competition. Other healthcare giants, most notably Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, are trying to get a piece of the RAS market. However, both have some ways to go before catching up to Intuitive Surgical. J&J's robot system, Ottava, has not yet been cleared in the U.S. The company plans to submit an application in the second half of this year to start clinical trials in the country."", ""The U.S. is generally the most lucrative market, so Johnson & Johnson is far behind. Medtronic's Hugo is already running clinical trials in the U.S., but it has yet to receive full regulatory clearance. Even if those two companies join the market, the RAS industry is severely underpenetrated. As Medtronic's management recently noted, only 5% of procedures that can be performed robotically currently are."", 'So there is room for multiple winners here over the long run.', ""Second, Intuitive Surgical runs the risk that demand for some of the procedures performed with its crown jewel will decrease. That has happened with the recent rise in popularity of weight loss medicines like Wegovy, which reduced volume growth in bariatric procedures. But as management notes, these make up only between 4% and 5% of total worldwide procedures. Even if these are cut in half, given the massive runway for growth in the RAS market, it shouldn't matter too much for Intuitive Surgical's financial results over the long run."", ""Intuitive Surgical has shown incredible resilience in the past few years, handling difficult conditions and slightly outperforming the broader market. That speaks volumes about the company's underlying business.

That's the day the company plans to complete the spinoff of its healthcare business, Solventum. The company will distribute 80.1% of the shares to its existing investors. It will retain the remaining 19.9% of Solventum, which it intends to monetize within the next five years. "", ""With that stock spinoff looming, you might wonder whether you should buy shares of 3M now. Here's why it's better to wait until after April 1 if you really want to purchase shares of the beaten-down industrial conglomerate or its healthcare unit."", ""3M's board of directors approved the spinoff of its healthcare business earlier this month. It expects Solventum to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker SOLV starting April 1. Existing 3M shareholders will get one share of Solventum for every four shares of 3M they own as of the record date for the distribution, which was March 18. "", ""Because that date has already passed, investors who buy 3M stock between now and April 1 might not receive shares of Solventum. The company noted in a press release that there will be two markets for 3M stock from March 26 through March 28. Some shares will trade with the right to receive Solventum stock, while others won't have that right. Because of that potential confusion, investors are better off waiting to buy shares. "", ""Another reason to be patient is that you could get a better deal on Solventum stock if you wait. Stock spinoffs tend to trade lower in the months following the transaction as existing investors unload shares of a company they don't want to own. That has been the case for Johnson & Johnson's consumer health products spinoff, Kenvue:"", 'KVUE data by YCharts', 'As that chart shows, Kenvue has lost a quarter of its value since its initial separation from Johnson & Johnson last year. Solventum could face a similar fate.', 'Likewise, investors interested in owning what remains of 3M could fetch a better price by waiting. Shares could face the same selling pressure as Solventum because investors who only want to own the spun-off entity could sell out of their remaining position in the industrial giant.', ""On top of that, there's another potential downside catalyst. 3M might opt to reset its high-yielding dividend after spinning off Solventum, which contributed a quarter of its revenue and earnings. We saw a similar outcome with W.P. Carey after the diversified REIT spun off its office properties into a new office-focused REIT, Net Lease Office Properties, last year. W.P.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.12b', 'US$2.30b', 'US$2.55b', 'US$2.77b', 'US$3.02b', 'US$3.20b', 'US$3.36b', 'US$3.50b', 'US$3.63b', 'US$3.75b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 6.18%', 'Est @ 5.01%', 'Est @ 4.19%', 'Est @ 3.62%', 'Est @ 3.22%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% ', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Republic Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.981. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Higher interest rates, buyouts, opening new branches and decent loan demand will aid net interest income (NII), though rising funding costs will weigh on it.While there has been a resurgence in M&A activities so far this year, a complete revival in deal-making is not certain. Thus, the performance of the investment banking (IB) business is not expected to improve significantly.Along with this, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates, will likely hamper fee income growth. Mounting operating expenses will hurt profits.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)Merck shares have gained +15.7% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +16.7%. The company’s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. The company is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line.

Last year, it spent $2 billion on strategically located natural gas storage assets to serve the growing LNG market. ', 'It has also looked into investing directly in LNG developments, including evaluating an acquisition of Tellurian (NYSEMKT: TELL), which is developing Driftwood LNG. Investments to support the growing LNG market could give it more fuel to grow its cash flow and 5.1%-yielding dividend. ', ""However, Williams has opted against acquiring Tellurian, deeming Driftwood too risky. Here's a look at why and what that means for Tellurian."", 'Natural gas pipeline giant Williams recently confirmed that it looked at buying Tellurian. The troubled LNG developer has been considering its strategic options. It hired advisors to help find potential strategic partners to fund its Driftwood LNG project and customers to buy the LNG it would produce. ', 'The company also put its natural gas production business up for sale. It would also consider a full sale if it got the right offer. ', ""It won't get that from Williams, which decided against putting in an offer because it considers Driftwood too risky. The issue is that Tellurian doesn't have commercial contracts with LNG buyers to back the facility. "", ""Tellurian previously had some customers for the project but terminated those deals because it wanted to offer a strategic partner the ability to invest in the project and be a major customer of its capacity. That strategy backfired after it couldn't find a partner willing to be both an investor and a customer. "", ""Rival LNG project developers, like Energy Transfer's (NYSE: ET) Lake Charles LNG, have secured commercial agreements with several natural gas producers and LNG buyers. Because of that, it has lined up a few companies interested in investing in the project, and some of them would also sign offtake agreements. While Energy Transfer still has a regulatory hurdle to clear before it can start building the project, its ability to secure long-term contracts with customers proves Lake Charles LNG is commercially viable -- something Tellurian can't offer potential investors. "", ""Tellurian is currently exploring all its options as it's seeking to find a way to move forward with Driftwood LNG. It's working with a financial advisor looking into alternative debt and equity financing options, including selling interests in Driftwood and Tellurian and the company's natural gas production business. "", 'The LNG developer has a huge task ahead. It ended last year with $1.3 billion in assets and only $75.8 million in cash. The company only generated $166.1 million in revenue from natural gas sales last year, down from $391.9 million in 2022, due to lower prices. Meanwhile, its net loss ballooned to $166.2 million, up from $49.8 million in 2022. ', ""Because of these issues, the company doesn't have the financial resources to develop Driftwood independently. It expects the first phase will cost $14.5 billion. While it has already invested over $1 billion into the project and has secured a sale-leaseback transaction for the 800-acre property where it's developing the project that would bring in another $1 billion, it needs one or more strategic partners willing to fund 60% to 65% of the equity required to build the project. "", ""It hasn't found partners willing to commit to investing in the project. That's likely because, unlike Energy Transfer's Lake Charles LNG, Tellurian hasn't secured commercial contracts to derisk the project. "", ""Tellurian is a very risky investment. It was so risky that even a deep-pocketed natural gas infrastructure giant like Williams wasn't willing to invest in the company. While it's still possible that Tellurian will find the strategic and commercial partners it needs to move forward with Driftwood, it's not a sure thing."", ' Because of that, investors should steer clear of the stock and consider investing in a financially stronger natural gas infrastructure company like Williams or Energy Transfer instead. In addition to their LNG-fueled upside potential, both companies pay attractive and growing dividends.

Passenger demand is steadily recovering post-COVID, in both the leisure and business segments, and the airlines overall are finding themselves able to meet the travel volumes. Reductions in general inflationary pressures, and the prospect of lower interest rates, are helping to offset likely permanent increases in labor and maintenance costs.', 'There are still idiosyncratic factors that the airlines have to deal with, in overall industry safety and reputation, but that’s likely to be counterbalanced by the increased presence of business travelers. Customer loyalty will also factor in as a supportive factor for some individual airline stocks.', 'UBS analyst Atul Maheswari has been looking into the details of the airline sector, as it continues to recover from the hit it took during the pandemic. He finds several reasons for optimism, and writes, in starting up his coverage of the US airline sector, “The key factor driving our positive bias is potential for cost pressures to moderate and margins to begin moving higher towards the end of 2024 and into 2025… We recommend buying select airline stocks in advance of this upcoming margin improvement later in 2024 and into 2025… We like airline stocks that have: 1) Strong FCF generation & solid or improving B/S, 2) Better near-term relative margin potential; 3) Exposure to business travel; 4) Strong customer loyalty & attractive loyalty program economics.”', 'Maheswari follows this up with several specific airline stock picks, choosing carriers that should see more gains going forward. According to the TipRanks database, these stocks have ‘Buy’ ratings and 20%-plus upside potential; here are the details.', 'Alaska Air Group (ALK)', 'First on our list is Alaska Air. This airline operates primarily on the West Coast of North America, and despite its name, the carrier is based in Seattle-Tacoma, in the State of Washington. While Alaska Air flies mainly along the West Coast, it does offer travel to destinations across the US, in much of Canada, and to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Alaska Air has a strong reputation for quality, but that took a hit recently when one of the airline’s Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft suffered a door blowout during flight.', 'The repercussions of that blowout are still rippling through the industry. Only minor injuries were reported in the accident, but investigations revealed that the aircraft in question had already been tagged for additional maintenance, and large-scale groundings of Boeing aircraft are still impacting the industry as a whole. The 737 is a widely popular passenger liner, and the MAX 9 is one of its most modern iterations – and makes up approximately 20% of Alaska’s fleet, 65 out of 314 total aircraft.', 'In another recent development, Alaska Air announced in December of last year that it had entered into a purchase agreement with Hawaiian Airlines. The deal will see Alaska buy Hawaiian for $1.9 billion, a sum that includes an $18 per share purchase price as well as Alaska’s assumption of $900 million in Hawaiian Air’s debt. The deal was approved by Hawaiian’s stockholders in February, but still requires regulatory approval before proceeding. The US Justice Department has requested additional information from the two airlines before rendering a decision. Pending approval, the airlines expect that the purchase transaction will be completed within 12 to 18 months of the original announcement date.', 'Turning to the financial side, we find that Alaska reported record-level revenues for the full-year 2023, of $10.4 billion at the top line. In the fourth quarter, revenue came to $2.55 billion, skimming above the forecast by $20 million and growing 3% year-over-year. The company’s quarterly bottom line, in non-GAAP measures, came to 30 cents per diluted share, based on net income of $38 million. The non-GAAP EPS was 12 cents per share better than had been expected. While the company burned cash in 4Q23, it saw a net positive operating cash flow for the full year of $1.1 billion.', 'Laying out the UBS view, analyst Maheswari notes that the stock stands to see benefits no matter how the Hawaiian Air deal shakes out, writing, “We believe ALK’s -15% underperformance vs the JETS ETF post HA deal announcement has created a compelling entry point. We think either one of the two outcomes (deal or no deal) will have positives for the stock. The merits of its standalone investment case are strong as our analysis shows the market is pricing in $1.57 bn in EBITDAR for ’25 vs. UBSe standalone ~$1.85 bn. Plus, we see optionality from higher synergies should\xa0the HA deal go through (UBSe proforma ’25 EBITDAR $2.35 bn).”', 'Summing up the situation, the analyst comes down with a bullish outlook: “Alaska is one of the best run US airlines with\xa0close to industry leading margins and a strong balance sheet. We see potential for ALK to benefit from several positive industry drivers over the next 12-18 months including improving revenue per available seat mile (RASM), moderation in cost pressures, and acceleration in biz travel. Plus, its West Coast exposure with hubs in SEA/ SFO/LAX makes it uniquely well placed to participate in an uptick in demand in that region. At these levels, we see a solid 3:1 upside/downside reward.”', 'Maheswari gives ALK shares a Buy rating along with a $54 price target that implies a one-year potential upside for the shares of 39%. (To watch Maheswari’s track record, click here)', 'Zooming out, the stock gets a Strong Buy rating from the Wall Street consensus, based on 11 reviews that include 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are trading for $38.78 and their $48 average target price points toward a gain of ~24% in the next 12 months. (See ALK stock forecast)', 'Delta Airlines (DAL)', 'Next on our list, Delta Airlines, is one of the industry’s largest legacy carriers, as well as a component of the S&P 500 index. The airline keeps its headquarters, and its chief transport hub, in Atlanta, and maintains additional hubs across the US – in NYC, in Boston, in Detroit, in Seattle-Tacoma, and in Los Angeles, to name a few. Delta is consistently ranked among the top-five largest US airlines, whether counting by passengers carried, destinations served, daily flights, or fleet size. On the global scene, Delta flies to major destinations around the world. The company has international hubs in Amsterdam, London, and Paris, as well as Tokyo and Seoul.', 'Delta’s airliner fleet totals nearly 1,000 mainline planes, with a wide variety in types and models. The company operates both narrow- and wide-body aircraft, on both long- and short-range routes. Historically, the company has preferred to fly Boeing aircraft, but since 2008 has been adding significant numbers of Airbus planes to the fleet. For regional flights, the company operates a smaller fleet of jets from Bombardier or Embraer. The variety in the fleet composition poses challenges for maintenance and training, but helps to insulate the company from large-scale regulatory groundings. This is an important factor, as a variety of issues with Boeing, including regulatory matters and manufacturing delays, have caused Delta to delay delivery of ordered 737 MAX 10 aircraft – the most modern version of the 737 – until 2027.', 'The air industry’s rebound from the COVID shutdowns can be seen in the headline number from Delta’s 2023 financial results. The airline reported record full-year revenue of $58 billion, and 2023’s operating income of $5.5 billion was nearly double the 2022 figure.', 'For 4Q23, wrapping up the year, Delta reported $14.2 billion at the top line, up 5.8% y/y and beating the estimates by $420 million. The company saw quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share by non-GAAP measures, 12 cents better than had been anticipated pre-release. The company’s quarterly adj. operating income came to $1.3 billion, and had an operating margin of 9.7%.', 'The company’s anticipated margin profile caught the eye of UBS analyst Maheswari, who uses it as a starting point in his bullish update on the company, writing of Delta, “We are bullish on DAL as we see potential upside to FY’24E & FY’25E margins driven by an inflection in unit revenues and moderation in cost pressures beginning 2H’24. Our FY’24 pretax margin est is 9.9%, up ~30 bps YoY, vs cons of 9.5% while our FY’25 est is 10.9% vs. cons 10.6%. We believe DAL’s revenue per seat mile (RASM) growth will positively surprise the market in 2H’24E as domestic RASM moves higher & Atlantic RASMs remain steady with these tailwinds persisting into ’25 assuming continued supply discipline. This coupled with our expectations for a meaningful moderation in cost pressures in ’25 from better employee productivity, lower maintenance expenses, and slowing pilot wage increase to ~4% from ~7% in ’24 should lead to a more material acceleration in DAL’s margins in ’25E. We recommend buying the stock now in advance of this upcoming multi-quarter period of margin expansion beginning in 2H of this year.”', 'Maheswari puts his stance into perspective by giving DAL an initial rating of Buy, and complementing that with a $59 price target showing his confidence in a 30% upside on the one-year horizon.', 'DAL gets plenty of love from Wall Street, and the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 13 positive analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $45.38 and the $54.33 average price target points toward a 20% upside over the next year. (See DAL stock forecast)', 'American Airlines (AAL)', 'We’ll wrap up this list with American Airlines, another of the giant legacy carriers in the US air travel sector. American, like Delta, is a perennial contender for the top slots among the US airlines, by fleet size, annual revenue, and number of passengers carried. The company is the world’s largest operator of the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody jets, and also has a significant fleet of Boeing 737 models. The company’s widebody planes are all from Boeing, mainly of the 787 family. American Airlines saw its mainline fleet increase by more than 4% year-over-year in 2023, up to 965 aircraft. This is supplemented by 556 regional aircraft.', 'American Airlines, with its regional partner carriers, offers passengers nearly 6,700 daily flights, to some 350 destinations in over 50 countries around the world. The airline’s chief hub and headquarters are in Fort Worth, Texas, one of the nation’s major airports, serving Dallas as well, and the company has additional hubs in LA, Miami, New York, Chicago, Phoenix, and DC.', 'This airline maintains one of the youngest air fleets in the industry, and earlier this month announced a major purchase plan, totaling 260 new aircraft, primarily from Airbus and Embraer. The order includes 85 new A320neo models, and is planned to boost American’s premium seating capacity by up to 20% by 2026. The 90 Embraer E175 models included in the order will be operated by the company’s regional carriers.', 'American finished last year with $53 billion in annual revenue, a record for the company. Quarterly revenue in Q4 came to $13.06 billion, a figure that was down 1% from the prior-year period and was in-line with expectations. Fourth quarter earnings were 29 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, a full 21 cents per share better than the forecasts. The airline had a full-year operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, and recorded its highest full-year free cash flow, at $1.8 billion.', 'In his coverage of American, analyst Maheswari is impressed by the cash flow – and expects it to remain strong. He is bullish on this airline, saying of it, “We expect AAL should see both strong FCF generation and profit acceleration in the next 2-3 years, unlocking higher equity value as net debt moves lower and B/S is delevered. Importantly, we don’t think this is priced in as our analysis suggests the market is pricing in just ~$8 bn in EBITDAR for ’25 (vs. UBSe $8.7 bn) with cons. estimating only ~$3.1 bn in FCF for ’24 and ’25 combined vs. UBSe $4 bn. We see the potential for upwards earnings revision with our ’25 pretax margin est. at 5.9% vs. cons. 5.3%. The stock is trading at ~19% FCF yield on our ’24 ests, which should provide downside support, in our view. Also, a unique near-term catalyst for AAL will be the renegotiation of its 10-year-old co-branded card program, which should drive an acceleration in high margin loyalty income.”', 'All told, these comments support Maheswari’s Buy rating, and his $19 price target points toward a 30.5% share appreciation for the year ahead.', 'While the UBS view is decidedly bullish, Wall Street generally is a bit less so. That said, the stock still claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 14 recent analyst recommendations that break down to 9 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares have a trading price of $14.57 and their $17.56 average target price suggests an upside of 20.5% this year.

It has been streamlining operations in the U.S. by prioritizing larger planes and major hubs, but relying less on hubs in Europe as flight activity decreases, according to a report published Thursday.', 'The air logistics unit’s meteoric growth has ended after seven years, but the company was able to maintain operating levels at a time when many cargo airlines, including FedEx and UPS, parked aircraft and reduced flights in response to the downturn in air cargo demand.', 'Perhaps more noteworthy, Amazon Air (NASDAQ: AMZN) largely kept its fleet and flight schedule intact even as growth in e-commerce sales normalized and the mega-retailer shifted to a regional fulfillment model that decreases reliance on air transport.', 'The report from the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University described how Amazon has 4.6% more payload capacity than a year ago despite having one fewer plane. It has also mostly transitioned to a hub-and-spoke model that mirrors FedEx and UPS, with less point-to-point flying. While total daily flights fell by 1.8%, to 202 per day, Amazon Air’s available ton-miles grew.', '', 'The researchers, led by Chaddick Institute Director Joseph Schwieterman, relied on geospatial mapping with flight tracking data for their analysis.', 'More than four in five Amazon Air flights within the U.S. mainland operate to or from its five largest hubs, up from 65.6% in early 2021. Flight activity at four of its five busiest hubs — Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky (CVG); San Bernardino, California; Ohio’s Wilmington Air Park; and Florida’s Lakeland-Linder — all grew over the past year.', 'Only Fort Worth Alliance Airport in Texas diminished in flight activity, a result researchers attributed to Amazon’s decision to discontinue use of five ATR-72 turboprop aircraft operated by Silver Airways and which accounted for a tiny fraction of the terminal’s tonnage.', 'Amazon relies on partner carriers, such as Silver, to operate its network because it isn’t a pure airline with its own operating authority. Amazon’s active fleet has plateaued in the past 18 months at about 80 aircraft, according to various aircraft databases. But during the peak of pandemic home shopping the fleet reached 88 aircraft.', '', 'Lakeland is now Amazon’s second-largest hub, with nearly 21 flights per day.', 'The Ohio Valley has become Amazon Air’s strategic center, accounting for more than half the flights in the U.S. mainland. After initially borrowing space from DHL Express, Amazon opened its own $1.5 billion facility at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky airport. Flights at CVG increased from 57.5 to 63.3 per day in the past 12 months, not including about six flights by unmarked partner carriers, according to the report. Wilmington Air Park, only 60 miles away, handles 20 flights per day. Concentrating flights at the Cincinnati hub, and clustering them into two tight arrival and departure blocks, allows for efficient plane-to-plane transfers that support overnight delivery.', 'Amazon Air still lags FedEx and UPS in proficiency, with turnaround times for aircraft of about five hours versus two to three hours for the integrated logistics providers, the Chaddick report said. At 8 years old, Amazon Air is still maturing. FedEx and UPS have operated air transport networks with huge hubs for decades.', 'Ditching the small turboprops was one of several adjustments Amazon made to its freighter fleet to better align the network with consumer demand and the renewed emphasis on regional order fulfillment. E-commerce sales in 2023 increased 7.6% to $1.1 trillion — more than three times the rate of growth for total retail sales. Last year, online shopping accounted for 15.4% of total sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. After exploding 43% during the first year of the pandemic, annual e-commerce sales growth is expected to be less than 10% in the coming years.', 'Amazon returned five Boeing 767-200 freighters because the lease expired and they were old. (It is scheduled to give back an additional seven 767-200s next month, the lessor recently said.) Meanwhile, Amazon added three 767-300 planes, all operated by contractor Air Transport International, and its first Airbus A330-300, operated by Hawaiian Airlines. In the process, the percentage of the fleet consisting of Boeing 737 or smaller planes, has fallen from 38% to 33% over the past year.', 'Amazon has signed leases for nine more A330-300 converted freighters, which are larger than the 767 widebodies.', 'The Silver Airways freighters — and air service to Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Wichita, Kansas — became expendable as Amazon moved to a fully regional, rather than national, fulfillment model. With orders distributed from eight regions, a good truck linehaul can perform as well as aircraft in key city pairs at lower cost with little to no impact for customers in small markets, logistics experts say.', 'In its effort to simplify the U.S. network, Amazon Air also ended regular flights to Mobile, Alabama; San Jose, California; and Tampa, Florida. Tampa is less than an hour’s drive from Lakeland-Linder airport. The company also halved air service to Las Vegas, which is less than four hours by truck from its San Bernardino hub, and cut service by about a third at Baltimore-Washington airport, which is a 7.5-hour drive from the Wilmington hub.', '', 'Last month, Amazon gave notice it is pulling out of San Antonio’s airport, closing on April 10. Amazon has air service to Austin, Texas, which is only an hour from San Antonio by truck. By April, Amazon will be in 47 U.S. airports, down from 53 last year.', 'In 2022, Amazon restructured fulfillment operations and transportation networks across the U.S., dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed the retailer to better utilize close-by inventory, while reducing stops per package and decreasing reliance on air transportation. Amazon says shortening the distance that deliveries have to travel to reach customers and improving inventory placement have helped achieve the fastest-ever shipping speeds.', 'Amazon always placed some inventory in regional warehouses to improve delivery times and reduce cost, according to a former Amazon executive who asked not to be named, but has now engineered its entire logistics network around that model. That means distribution centers have a limited mix of products available for same-day or next-day delivery. If a shopper, especially in a non-major metro area, wants a ruffled bed sheet instead of a standard one, he or she may have to wait more than two days for it to be shipped from a larger distribution center farther away.', 'Trucks do well for short and medium lengths of haul to less populated areas because customers have learned to accept that a special delivery may take longer, or that the order cutoff time may be earlier for day-definite delivery, the industry source said. In this scenario, freighters become more of a luxury used to enhance customer satisfaction with a speedy delivery from one regional center to another when there is a mismatch in regional inventory levels.', '“I would argue that some of these 737s that they fly, say from Dallas to New Orleans, are not necessary because nothing you’re flying on short haul is profitable,” the individual said.', 'The report noted that Amazon is increasingly reluctant to deploy many flights at passenger-focused airports that are crowded and have limited room for warehouse expansion. Chicago-Rockford, Lehigh Valley airport in Pennsylvania and Sacramento airport in California have picked up flights while flights have diminished, or stayed flat, at Chicago O’Hare, New York John F. Kennedy and San Francisco airports.', 'A Chaddick Institute report last August found that cargo-focused airports outside large metropolitan areas give freighter operators several advantages, including faster shipment discharge and developable land for cargo facilities.', 'While Amazon Air slightly increased U.S. capacity and added a handful of daily flights in Canada and India, flight activity in Europe dropped by more than a third over the past year. That followed a 29% reduction in flights in 2022. Reductions included flights carried out by partner airlines using their own unbranded aircraft. Amazon has about nine branded aircraft in its European fleet.', 'Late last year, Amazon closed its regional air hub at Leipzig/Halle International Airport in Germany in response to a downturn in e-commerce sales and parcel volumes. Activity peaked in early 2022 at 18 flights per day, operated by contractor ASL Airlines Ireland using Boeing 737-800 converted freighters. All but one route was shifted to Hannover in northern Germany and Liege airport in Belgium. Leipzig now averages fewer than two Amazon flights per day.', 'Amazon Air completely exited Germany’s Cologne/Bonn airport in late 2022 and has sharply cut back flights at two U.K. airports in the aftermath of Brexit.', 'The network currently serves 10 airports, down from a high of 13 three years ago. More than 80% of Europe’s population remains within 300 miles of an Amazon Air airport. Such distances can be covered within a day on a truck, the report says.', 'Amazon’s domestic fleet outperformed normal seasonality in February with the flight count up 13% year over year after being flat in January, according to the Alpha Parcel Tracker report from Morgan Stanley.', 'The Chaddick researchers predicted that in the next year Amazon Air will gradually begin to expand flight operations, mostly at its CVG national hub and four large regional hubs. By mid-2025, the combined daily flight activity at CVG and Wilmington will grow to more than 125, including partner flights, with CVG alone having at least 85. Nonhub flying will be simultaneously reduced.', 'Amazon will remain relatively small in Europe, but it will grow again in a measured way, especially near where logistics infrastructure is being built, the report said. Potential growth areas include Scandinavia, Greece and the Balkan countries.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.', 'Contact Reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\xa0', 'Pilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks', 'Amazon’s largest cargo jet makes debut', 'Amazon’s return of leased cargo jets hurts ATSG profit', 'The post Amazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

This significant move in the market reflects Wall Street traders' optimism about the prospect of the Fed adjusting its monetary policy in response to economic conditions. The Federal Reserve's indication of a potential shift in its approach to interest rates prompted a rally in short-term bonds, as investors reacted to the reassurance of forthcoming cuts. The central bank's communication, including the 'dot plot' which confirmed expectations of three rate cuts within the year, provided clarity to market participants and fueled confidence in future economic stability. This development comes amid ongoing global economic shifts, including challenges within China's property market, as highlighted by Bain Capital's assessment that there is no immediate solution to the issues faced. Despite these broader economic concerns, the Fed's decision to maintain rates unchanged while signaling potential cuts has injected optimism into financial markets. The rally in equities was widespread, with various sectors experiencing gains, particularly those that had previously underperformed, such as small-cap stocks. This suggests a broad-based confidence in the resilience of corporate profits, bolstered by the anticipated supportive monetary policy. Moreover, the outperformance of short-term Treasury bonds underscores the shifting sentiment among traders, who now anticipate the possibility of the Fed's initial rate adjustment occurring as early as June.

With the UK economy slipping into a technical recession at the end of 2023 due to various factors including a gas supply shock following the Ukraine crisis, the Bank of England is under pressure to support economic recovery. Economists are divided on the timing of rate cuts, with some suggesting a possible reduction as early as June, aligning with market expectations. Despite the encouraging inflation figures, policymakers remain cautious, with uncertainties surrounding the extent and timing of rate adjustments. The Bank's decision may hinge on further data, particularly on wage growth and services inflation, with some analysts suggesting a more prudent approach towards rate cuts, possibly in August.

This happens because while you are getting the same dividend, it is now costing you less money to acquire it. As long as the dividend remains sustainable, buying a dividend stock on a dip in price or near a low can be an advantageous thing for income investors to do.', ""Pharma stock Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has dropped more than 30% in value over the past 12 months and is now trading near its 52-week lows. Today, its dividend yield is an incredible 6.1%, which is well above the S&P 500 average of 1.4% and also far higher than what Pfizer's dividend has been in the past. Has Pfizer become an incredible buy for dividend investors, and is it the best dividend stock you can own today?"", ""A crucial question for investors any time they deal with a high-yielding dividend, particularly one that's yielding more than 5%, is whether or not the payout is safe. If a dividend isn't sustainable, then that means a dividend cut could be around the corner, and it may not be much of a deal for investors."", ""If you were to look at Pfizer's payout ratio based on earnings, it would look unsustainable. For 2023, its diluted earnings per share totaled just $0.37; the company's dividend totals $1.68 per year. But that is a bit misleading because while Pfizer did have an off year in 2023, its results were hampered by asset impairment charges, which don't affect cash and are nonrecurring."", ""In terms of free cash flow, Pfizer's dividend looks much more sustainable, with the company typically generating more free cash than its dividend payments."", ""This suggests that while Pfizer's dividend is high, it may not be in danger of a cut."", 'Another important question for dividend investors to consider is the state of the overall business. While the dividend may look safe based on its recent results, what matters is what the future holds and whether the upcoming results will be strong enough to support the dividend.', 'This is the bigger risk for Pfizer. The company is facing many headwinds as top products are losing exclusivity in the near future, and revenue from its COVID vaccine and pill is also likely to diminish. The healthcare company is leaning on acquisitions and its pipeline to help fill in the gap and to grow its top line.', ""The acquisition of cancer company Seagen last year will assist with that goal. The deal is part of a broader plan for Pfizer to add $25 billion in revenue by 2030. That would be great news if the company wasn't also facing an $18 billion loss in revenue as multiple key drugs lose patent protection in the years ahead, including Eliquis, Vyndaqel, Xeljanz, and others."", ""It isn't an easy path ahead for Pfizer, but the business is planning ahead. This is a good thing, as that reduces some of the long-term risk for investors. By acquiring companies and investing in its pipeline, Pfizer's business should be in good shape."", ""Pfizer has paid a quarterly dividend for 341 consecutive quarters -- that's a span of more than 85 years.

Ugur Sahin, our CEO and Co-Founder; Ozlem Tureci, Chief Medical Officer and Co-Founder; Jens Holstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Richardson, Chief Strategy Officer.With this, I would like to hand over to Ugur."", 'Ugur Sahin', ""Thank you, Victoria. A warm welcome to all those joining us today.Slide 5. Let me start by reiterating our vision and company goals. BioNTech was founded 15 years ago with the vision to harness the power of the immune system to fight human diseases, particularly cancer. The emergence of the pandemic accelerates our mission leading to the development of our COVID-19 vaccine. This achievement not only showcased the (inaudible) clarity of our mRNA technology, but also highlighted our unique expertise and ability to execute fast.Our vision was realized and prudent, eliminating the potential of our science across other therapeutic areas. Building on this, our 3 objectives moving forward are to establish a multiproduct company covered by our pioneering technologies and science to address medical needs worldwide.To contribute to the development of innovative precision medicines against cancer, aiming for multiple product approvals in the coming years. And to expand and strengthen our sustainable respiratory infectious disease vaccine business, building on the success of our COVID-19 franchise.Slide 6. On the next slide, I want to talk about our clinical achievements in 2023. We successfully advanced our clinical pipeline and enhance our technology platforms, digital capabilities and infrastructure by executing across our key strategic initiatives. We continue to develop and empower our innovative oncology and infectious disease pipeline.Today, we have over 20 programs in oncology and 7 programs in infectious disease being evaluated in more than 40 clinical trials, including multiple Phase II or Phase III clinical trials.I'm particularly excited about our recent achievements in shaping our oncology pipeline. We started 7 clinical trial, in-licensed 6 clinical assets throughout the year. Most importantly, several assets have advanced to mid- and late-stage development with Phase II and Phase III clinical trials ongoing.This task feature antibody-drug conjugate mRNA vaccines and novel IO therapies in indications such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast and endometrial cancer, adjuvant colorectal cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer.In infectious disease, we started 3 first-in-human Phase I clinical care, leveraging our [proprietary] mRNA vaccine technology including candidates being evaluated against shingles, tuberculosis and mpox.Over the course of 2024, we aim to advance and prioritize additional product candidates to late-stage development. We expect to have 10 or more potential regulation type earnings.Slide 7. The fleet of oncology is currently undergoing a significant shift away from traditional shingle therapy towards combination therapies. This shift leverages the power of immuno-oncology and antibody drug conjugates to potentially transform also advanced cancer into a manageable condition.As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, we can proudly say that we have accelerated our IO and ADC programs by not only starting new task, but also successfully recruiting over 2,000 patients in our clinical trials across various indications. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team and our collaboration partners as well as the trust and willingness of patients to participate in our study.Looking ahead to 2024, we aim to build on the success and recruit patients into our clinical trials across indications such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and other indications.Slide 8. In 2023, we successfully executed strategic investments, acquisitions, licensing agreements and public private partnerships enabling our continued progress towards building a multi-product, AI-powered patient-centric company.Since our foundation, we have placed a strong emphasis on computational medicine, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the acquisition of InstaDeep, we are integrating capabilities in supercomputing AI research and generative AI into various processes. For example, to identify and optimize molecules to predict biological and clinical outcomes and to speed up our workflow.In 2023, we expanded our technology base to include ADCs by initiating new collaborations with DualityBio and Medilink Therapeutics. We believe ADCs have the potential to supplement or replace highly toxic chemotherapy regimens as a new combination backbone of cancer treatment.Our collaborations with OncoC4 and Biotheus complement our toolkit of technologies with next-generation IO antibodies that offer unique mechanisms of action, and have augmented our oncology pipeline with mid- to late-stage clinical programs.We have started strongly in 2024 on the collaboration front by announcing a strategic alliance with Autolus aimed at advancing both companies, autologous CAR-T cell programs towards commercialization. With this collaboration leads to support the development and commercialization of Autolus lead cell therapy candidate, (inaudible) and retain options to participate in its Auto 122 and Auto [6 mg] programs. Importantly, we have the option to use Autolus commercial and cell therapy manufacturing infrastructure in a cost-efficient manner. This is of relevance for our plans to extend the development of BNT211 to additional closing 6 positive tumor types, and thus realize its full potential.Slide 9. BNT211 is our CAR-T cell therapy targeting Claudin-6. To improve CAR-T cell in (inaudible) and persistence, we codevelop a CAR-T cell amplifying RNA vaccine or CARVac for short. BNT211 is one example of BioNTech's novel company. The goal is to enhance the system and effector function of CAR-T cell by repeated administration of CARVac.Recently, we presented data suggesting a favorable effect of CARVac on CAR-T cell persistence in our clinical trial with Claudin-6 tumors. Based on the promising early clinical results, we believe that BNT211 has the potential to make a significant impact in patients with Claudin-6 positive tumors.Our new term strategy is to establish Claudin-6 as a proven target in solid tumors and to establish BNT211 as the first CAR-T cell therapy in gene cell tumors. Claudin-6 is both to be expressed in solid cancers, including ovarian, lung, gastric, pediatric, cancers and other. Upcoming data will inform the development path for other tumor indications.Slide 10. In 2024, we will continue building a portfolio of compound classes that have been adjusted mechanisms of action, including immunomodulators, targeted therapies and mRNA vaccines. We believe that combination of these therapies, if approved, could play an important role in the efforts towards potentially curative approaches.With that, I would like to thank you all for your confidence in our success and your continued support. I will now turn the call over to Ozlem, who will speak about our oncology pipeline."", 'Ozlem Tureci', ""Thank you, Ugur. Glad to be speaking with everyone today.Starting on Slide 12, with an overview of our oncology pipeline. In 2023, we and our partners reported data across our portfolio at multiple medical meetings, including ASCO and ESMO. And we published manuscript in (inaudible) journal.More data readouts are expected this year, starting at AACR on the BNT122, our individualized neoantigen-based cancer vaccine in adjuvant PDAC and on BNT116, our off-the-shelf cancer vaccine in non-small cell lung cancer.In 2023, we advanced and expanded our pipeline considerably and now have multiple mid- to late-stage trials ongoing. Our aim is to continue to progress our oncology pipeline towards pivotal data readouts and submissions for regulatory approvals in the next 18 months.Slide 13. Here on the left are the ongoing trials in mid- to late-stage development. The 3 on top of this were initiated in 2023. BNT316, an anti-CTLA-4 and IO experience on non-small cell lung cancer. BNT323, an anti-HER2-low ADC in HER2-low low breast cancer, and BNT122, our individualized cancer vaccine in the SCLC pancreatic cancer space.On the right are the product candidate based on ADC IO mRNA cancer vaccine modalities for which we are planning to initiate additional Phase II and Phase III trials. These programs include validated and novel targets as well as in-house and in-licensed assets with unique mode of action.We believe we have multiple shots on goal. Our in-licensed assets are starting to contribute to value creation and towards derisking our pipeline. We plan to explore potential combination product candidates, featuring these assets based on the scientific rationale, preclinical and clinical evidence and also thinking of future treatment sequencing in different indications to provide options for patients along their disease journey.As shown in Slide 14, in 2023, we began building a pipeline of ADC candidates that now includes third-generation ADC directed against 4 distinct targets. These 4 targets collectively cover a wide range of cancer types. Our reason for adding this modality to our clinical multi-platform pipeline is that we believe ADCs will transform the oncology space and become broadly used backbone of combination treatment.Our strategy for acquiring these specific assets was based on their potentially differentiated profile, the objective of covering multiple cancer attacks and the broad market they may address. BNT323, a HER2 targeting ADC, is our most advanced ADC. It also is one of our frontrunners in our clinical pipeline.Now on Slide 15, BNT323 is a 3rd generation ADC that aims to overcome the drawbacks of first- and second-generation ADCs to achieve high stability in such relation, low risk of target halo delivery, a high drug antibody ratio of 8 and an expanded therapeutic window. It is comprised of a humanized anti-HER2 IgG antibodies, covalently attached to a potent proprietary DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. We -- via a stable maleimide tetrapeptide linker selectively achievable by pyrimidine that are operate regulated in tumor cell.BNT323 binding to HER2 on the surface of tumor cells inhibit HER2 signaling followed by internalization of a ADC HER2 receptor contact, cleavage of the linker and release of the membrane permeable payload. The effect is not only killing of these tumor cells, but also bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, regardless of their HER2 expression levels.In preclinical studies with other 3rd generation ADCs in animal models, BNT323 was observed to have higher stability, lower levels of free payload and circulation and more efficient payload release within tumor cells and stronger antitumor activity, including in HER2-low model. On Slide 16 now, BNT323 is currently being evaluated in a signal seeking Phase I/II clinical trial forward to expressing advanced solid tumor. The dose expansion part of the Phase I/II study is enrolling pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 expressing solid tumors.As of February of this year, more than 300 patients have received BNT323 in this Phase I/II trial. The first data from this study were presented at ASCO last year. We reported preliminary antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2 expressed in solid tumors.Responses were observed in patients treated with different dose levels and with different HER2 expression status. Based on our findings, in these dark green marked cohort on the right, we have initiated potentially registrational trials in patients with endometrial cancer and breast cancer.On Slide 17, in the breast cancer cohort of our Phase I/II trial with 26 patients with HER2-positive cancer, which means high and intermediate levels of HER2 expression, showed an objective response rate of 50% and a disease control rate of 96.2%. The 13 patients refer to low breast cancer that have a particularly high medical need, had an objective response rate of 38.5%, and thus disease control rate of 84.6%.BNT323 was observed to be well tolerated and all adverse events were manageable. [Interspecial] lung disease of Grade 1 occurred in 2 out of these 85 patients. Based on this data, we initiated a Phase III study of BNT323 in chemotherapy naive patients with hormone receptor positive HER2-low breast cancer, whose disease has progressed on prior endocrine therapy with or without CDK4/6 inhibition in the metastatic setting versus investigator charge of chemotherapy.As shown on Slide 18, in the U.S., the U.K., the EU4 and Japan, approximately 700,000 patients per year are diagnosed with breast cancer. The majority of those achieved remission for territory of the initial therapy. Those that do not get cured are being treated with hormonal and targeted therapies and chemotherapy.3rd generations of HER2 targeting antibodies only benefited both 30% of patients with high or intermediate expression levels of HER2, designated as HER2 positive. More recently, patients with HER2-low expression that comprise 2/3 of the remaining 70% breast cancer patients have been shown to benefit substantially from new generation HER2-targeted ADC therapy.HER2 directed ADCs are currently only approved for chemotherapy experienced patients, meaning from first line onwards. In our ongoing Phase III study, we are targeting chemo-naive patients from second line onwards, as marked here in dark green.Slide 19, coming back to our Phase I/II trial and the findings in endometrial cancer patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low. For endometrial cancer, we received fast track designation and breakthrough designation from the FDA in 2023. In September 2023, clinical data from 17 patients with endometrial cancer were presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting. All patients had received one or more treatment lines, including immunotherapy anti-HER2 antibody or endocrine therapy.BNT323 shows promising antitumor activity across different HER2 expression levels, including IHC 1+ expression, which is low expression with an objective response rate of 58.8%, of which 35.5% are pending confirmation. The disease control rate was 94.1%.While the synthesis is just small and data cutoff is too early to draw conclusions on less frequent treatment emergent adverse events and TEAEs with protracted manifestation, the safety profile was manageable and no new safety signals were observed.Slide 20, patients with advanced unresectable or recurrent endometrial cancer receive treatments based on their molecular profile. The latest clinical data support adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy as a frontline treatment for patients with Stage 4 endometrial cancer and dMMR status. Patients who overexpress HER2 can be treated with HER2 targeting therapies such as HER2 tumor in combination with chemotherapy as a frontline treatment.Despite the recent advancements in first-line treatment, most patients relapse. At present, there is no targeted therapy approved for patients who progressed on first-line treatment and post tumor expressed HER2. This is the patient population we are currently focusing on with the BNT323.Slide 21. I would like to reemphasize that our aim for 2024 is to further advance our key programs into late-stage development with the aim of contributing to the next generation of oncology medicines that could include candidates featured on this slide. We believe our investments and efforts will pave the way for an initial wave of oncology product launches from 2026 onwards.I'll now pass the presentation to our CFO, Jens Holstein."", 'Jens H. Holstein', ""Thank you, Ozlem, and a warm welcome to everyone who has dialed in today's call.2023 was another successful year for BioNTech on its journey to develop novel therapies for cancer and infectious diseases. Let me highlight 3 main points here.We kept our global COVID-19 vaccine market leadership. We grew and advanced our late-stage pipeline. And we, again, delivered a strong financial performance, highlighted by EUR 3.8 billion of total recognized revenues, EUR 1.2 billion of profit before tax, resulting in earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of EUR 3.83. With this, we ended the 2023 financial year with approximately EUR 17.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and security investments.Turning to the next slide. While our financial performance in 2023 was strong, and we were able to maintain profitability, there were also some financial challenges that we had to navigate through. In our third quarter earnings call last year, we updated our full year 2023 COVID-19 vaccine revenue guidance to around EUR 4 billion, reflecting write-downs in the amount of approximately EUR 600 million by our collaboration partner, Pfizer.In Q4, Pfizer recognized additional write-downs of approximately EUR 300 million, that negatively impacted our top line figure compared to our initial expectations for Q4. The negative impact on our revenue for 2023 accumulated to a total of approximately EUR 900 million.Write-downs related to [each] inventory would typically have a negative impact on the gross profit in the P&L. Following our gross profit share agreement for Pfizer, write-downs by our partner have a negative effect on BioNTech's revenue figure. That made our revenue guidance for 2023 challenging.Having said that, the agreement has an important advantage. BioNTech only requires very little commercial infrastructure in the COVID-19 vaccine franchise, and with this, has low expenses related to sales and marketing in comparison to other players in the field. This is, we believe, favorable as COMIRNATY is a leading brand in the global COVID-19 vaccine market.Despite the decrease in our revenues in 2023 and despite the negative impact of these write-downs, we were able to both remain profitable in 2023 and grew our year-end financial position in respect of cash, cash equivalents and security investments to EUR 17.7 billion compared to EUR 13.9 billion at the end of 2022.Please note that the contractual settlement of the gross profit share has a temporary offset of more than 1 calendar quarter. In addition, Pfizer financial quarter for the subsidiaries outside the United States differs from ours.I'll be moving now to the summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and full year of 2023, as shown on the next slide. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, we recognized EUR 1.5 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenues compared to EUR 4.3 billion for the comparative period in 2022.For the financial year 2023, our total reported revenues reached EUR 3.8 billion compared to EUR 17.3 billion in 2022. This was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 vaccine market demand, and as stated before, write-downs reported by our collaboration with Pfizer, which negatively influenced our revenues.Moving to cost of sales. Cost of sales amounted to EUR 179 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, in line with the EUR 183.5 million for the comparative prior year period. For the 2023 financial year, the cost of sales amounted to close to EUR 600 million compared to approximately EUR 3 billion in 2022. The drop was mainly caused by the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine sales.Research and development expenses reached EUR 578 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 510 million for the comparative period in 2022. For the 2023 financial year, research and development expenses amounted to approximately EUR 1.8 billion compared to EUR 1.5 billion in 2022. The increase was mainly influenced by progressing clinical studies for pipeline candidates as well as by our newly acquired product candidates and the development of variant adapted COVID-19 vaccines.In line with the higher head count compared to the previous year to -- for example, support our existing clinical trials and future growth initiatives, we also saw respective higher costs in wages, benefits and social security expenses in the financial year 2023.General and administrative expenses amounted to approximately EUR 0.1 million for both the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as for the comparative period in 2022. For the 2023 financial year, general and administrative expenses remained at EUR 0.5 billion, around the same level as in the previous year. The slight increase in G&A was mainly influenced by increased expenses for IT services as well as by wages, benefits and social security expenses, resulting from an increase in headcount.Income taxes were accrued with an amount of EUR 205.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 893.9 million for the comparative period in 2022. For the 2023 financial year, income taxes were accrued with an amount of EUR 255.8 million compared to EUR 3.5 billion in 2022. The derived effective income tax rate for the 2023 financial year was 21.6%, roughly in line with our expectations of around 21%, improved versus last year's tax rate of 27%.For the fourth quarter of 2023, net profit reached EUR 457.9 million compared to EUR 2.3 billion in the comparative period in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net profit reached EUR 0.9 billion compared to EUR 9.4 billion in 2022.Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR 1.90 compared to EUR 9.26 for the comparative period in 2022. For the 2023 financial year, our diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 3.83 compared to EUR 37.77 in 2022.Let's continue with the next slide. This shows the 2023 financial guidance provided to you during our Q3 earnings call in November 2023 in comparison with the actuals for the 2023 financial year.Starting from the top. We recognized EUR 3.8 billion of COVID-19 vaccine revenues compared to our guidance of around EUR 4 billion. Approximately EUR 300 million additional write-downs by our collaboration partner had to be unexpectedly recognized in Q4.Moving to R&D expenses. During the 2023 financial year, our R&D expenses were nearly EUR 1.8 billion, slightly below our amended guidance from November of 2023 of EUR 1.82 billion. Lower spending in, for example, our collaborations have been a main contributor as well as strong cost control measures. Our co-R&D activities in 2023 focused on broadening and accelerating our existing pipeline of product candidates in oncology and infectious diseases in line with our expectations.Moving to SG&A expenses. During the 2023 financial year, we recognized EUR 558 million in SG&A expenses, slightly below the lower end of our amended guidance of EUR 600 million to EUR 650 million. Again, we were closely monitoring our spending to reflect the uncertainty on the revenues without jeopardizing the future needs in this area.Moving to CapEx. Our 2023 financial year capital expenditures for operating activities amounted to EUR 276 million, whereof the majority was related to investments in building our laboratory and office facilities in Mainz, Germany. The spending is in line with our expectations, ranging from EUR 200 million to EUR 300 million.Lastly, tax. As already mentioned during the 2023 financial year, we reached an annual effective income tax rate of 21.6%, which is roughly in line with our amended guidance of around 21%.Turning to the next slide, showing the 2024 financial year guidance. Let me highlight now some key aspects of the company's outlook for the 2024 financial year. Starting with total revenues for the BioNTech Group.We expect total revenues in the range of EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 3.1 billion for 2024. In providing a range estimate today, we take, to some extent, potential up and downsides into account. For example, we assume largely the same vaccination rate for the U.S. market, but have seen some price pressure in the U.S. in Q4, some smaller inventory write-down with -- by our collaboration partner, Pfizer, as we have faced, again, additional write-downs above the previous announced ones that hit our revenues again in Q4 2023.We also assume that we generate revenues from a pandemic preparedness contract with the German government in 2024. For the 2024 financial guidance, we expect our R&D expenses to be in the range of EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion, while our SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million.Please note that anticipated expenses related to the external legal advice in connection with legal litigations is not reflected in SG&A, but in other operating expenses.Additionally, the guidance does not include, but may be impacted by potential payments resulting from any collaboration agreements or in-licensing deals, M&A transactions or outcomes of ongoing or future legal disputes or related activities such as judgment for settlements.Lastly, capital expenditures for the 2024 financial year are expected to be in the range of EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million. In 2024, we will be increasing our operating expenses in R&D and SG&A to accelerate BioNTech's transition into a multiproduct oncology and infectious disease company with a commercial footprint. For that, we want to increase our investments to lift the potential value that we see in our portfolio of product candidates.In 2023, we in-licensed multiple assets to bolster our late-stage pipeline. This year, we will invest in progressing our candidates into later-stage trials to fuel BioNTech's next stage of growth. As previously mentioned, we aim to have 10 or more potentially registration of clinical trials ongoing by the end of 2024. With this, we paved the way for multiple potential product approvals, estimated to begin with first launch in 2026.As previously indicated, 2024 will be a transition year for our company, during which, we will continue to invest in our long-term growth strategy while maintaining strict cost discipline.Overall, during this transition year, our revenues will be driven largely by the uptake of our COVID-19 vaccines in the second half of 2024. As a consequence of the expected revenue range and taking into account cost of sales, R&D and all other expenses, we do not expect to be profitable in 2024.Turning to the next slide. Today, BioNTech has a leading and profitable COVID-19 vaccine business. As you can see on this slide, our COVID-19 vaccine business benefited from its lean fixed cost structure in 2023 and generates very attractive positive results.In the coming years, we aim to invest alongside our partner in bringing variant adapted and potentially combination vaccines to market with the goal to further contributing to our future value generation. In addition to our value contributing COVID-19 vaccine franchise, we are investing into long-term value creation with our multiple product oncology pipeline.Let me highlight 3 value drivers. We plan to have 10 or more potentially registrational trials ongoing by the end of 2024. We aim to have a first potential oncology launch in 2026, adding to our top line. And thirdly, we believe to have a diversified clinical pipeline that offers multiple product growth opportunities for the years to come.Summarizing, we believe that our COVID-19 vaccine franchise and our innovative pipeline of product candidates will drive long-term value creation for the company.Our Chief Strategy Officer, Ryan Richardson, will now talk you through some of the strategic drivers for this transformation. Thank you."", 'Ryan Richardson', ""Thank you, Jens. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I'll provide a high-level overview of our 2030 strategy and the path to value creation from our mid- and late-stage oncology pipeline programs before concluding with a few important dates to mark on your calendars.On the next slide, we highlight the broad value creation opportunities underpinning our 2030 strategy. Our balance sheet has been further strengthened in 2023, and we'll continue to serve as a strategic asset to fuel long-term growth.We will continue to invest behind our market-leading COVID-19 vaccine franchise, leveraging our partnership with Pfizer across R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions. On a product contribution basis, we expect this franchise to continue to be highly cash generative.We are working with Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 and Influenza combination vaccine, which is successful in late-stage trials, could reach the market as early as fall 2025. We are ramping up our investments into our expanding and diverse late-stage oncology pipeline.Our goal is to have at least 10 trials initiated with registrational potential by the end of this year. We believe this broad pipeline can deliver multiple new commercial product launches in the years ahead.Finally, we will continue to invest to industrialize our mRNA vaccine platform to address infectious diseases with high unmet global need. Today, we have 5 infectious disease vaccines beyond COVID-19 in Phase I clinical trials. By 2030, we aim to bring our first vaccines from this pipeline to market, complemented by an expanding late-stage infectious disease vaccine pipeline.Our 2030 strategy aims to transform BioNTech into a diversified cash flow-generating multiproduct company that can deliver sustained long-term growth.Turning to the next slide. I would like to spend a little more time today on the growth potential of our expanding late-stage pipeline. This pipeline includes 7 mid- and late-stage programs that are currently in Phase II and III trials.We have mentioned our goal to have 10-plus trials with registrational potential initiated by the end of 2024. We also expect a busy calendar program updates this year. These include updates on several cancer vaccine programs at AACR, which were announced last week and further anticipated updates for specific IO and ADC programs at other major medical conferences throughout the year.2024 will therefore be an important year of execution as we transition toward our goal of commercializing our oncology portfolio. We are looking forward to sharing further details on these programs throughout the course of the year.Ultimately, we believe our oncology pipeline can deliver one or more indication launches per year from 2026 onwards. We see significant potential for our mid- and late-stage programs to address unmet medical need across a broad range of cancer types and across the cancer treatment continuum. We are truly excited by the potential our oncology pipeline holds to expand and improve on cancer treatment options for people around the world.In closing, I would like to highlight on the next slide a few important investor events we will be holding this year. Our Annual General Meeting will take place on May 17, and the next Innovation Series event on November 14.This year, we will also introduce a new and exciting event, focused on our expanding work in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will take place on October 1. We look forward to sharing further details on both events in the near future.With that, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and open the floor for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners.', 'Daina Michelle Graybosch', 'Yes. I look forward to these 10 potential registrational trials, I wonder if you can talk about maybe even a range of revenue expectations that you could be looking at by 2030 from the oncology portfolio? And then I have a follow-up.', 'Ryan Richardson', ""Yes. Thanks, Daina. I think the pipeline is quite broad. And one of the criteria that is common among most of those assets in that list is actually that they can target multiple solid tumors. And so that means that, that actually, the peak sales estimate for those -- for that collection of assets is actually well over EUR 10 billion in our range long-term -- in our estimates long-term.And -- but I think we're focused now on executing in those first launches. So I think we're not prepared yet to give you a 2030 number. But we do think that we're talking here about double-digit indications that we can address across the solid tumor landscape."", 'Daina Michelle Graybosch', 'Great. And then my follow-up is more specific on the Autolus collaboration. I wonder if you could talk about potential scenarios for how you see your CAR-T business with Autolus maturing and advancing in the next 5 years?', 'Ryan Richardson', ""Sure. So I'll start with that, too. So the primary rationale for Autolus was that, as we ended 2023, we actually had higher conviction on moving forward more aggressively with BNT211, which is our lead cell therapy CAR-T program, as you know, targeting Claudin-6 with an mRNA vaccine amplifier.And so we've talked about testicular future being a potential lead indication and faster -- a potential fast-to-market path given the high unmet need in the refractory setting, but we're also seeing strong and encouraging data in other indications such as refractory ovarian cancer and even in responses in lung cancer and other Claudin-6 positive tumors.And so the Autolus collaboration gives us a sort of runway to more aggressively explore multiple pivotal trials in parallel, leveraging the manufacturing infrastructure that we have in the United States, through the Kite acquisition of assets that we had 2.5 years ago, but also combined with the Autolus state-of-the-art manufacturing infrastructure in the United Kingdom. So that's the first rationale.And then in addition to that, the deal incorporates some options where we could come in at the pivotal trial stage into a couple of Autolus' programs. We find their Phase I data for our CD19/22 very encouraging. It's early, but it's encouraging. And also the GD2 CAR, we think, is an interesting approach that could be complementary.So the collaboration contract gives us the optionality to actually scale into a multiproduct franchise in cell therapy while keeping our fixed cost lean and allowing us to accelerate BNT211 forward."", 'Operator', 'And your next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Steven on for Chris. I had one on the financial side. Can you just give a little bit of color about what's driving the increase in SG&A guidance? I think at the midpoint, it's about over a 30% increase from the prior year. So just wondering if that's related to COVID or if that's more related to building out the oncology franchise?And then specifically on your HER2 ADC, can you just talk about what type of clinical profile would be attractive in that HER2-low breast cancer indication?"", 'Jens H. Holstein', ""Yes. I'll take the first one on the SG&A expense increase that we anticipate for 2024. You have heard from us that we're planning to launch potentially our first product in 2026. Of course, we've got to build up the infrastructure to be able to commercialize those compounds that are coming then in 2016 and onwards. And therefore, we intend to invest in infrastructure, specifically also in the commercial setup in the U.S. going forward."", 'Ozlem Tureci', 'The second question was, what makes for HER2 ADC, the indication of hormone receptor positive HER2 to low breast cancer interesting. Did I get that right?', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'More kind of expectations for what type of clinical profile would be attractive in that space.', 'Ozlem Tureci', '[Oh, COVID as a TPP]. So our HER2 ADC, we think, has a differentiable safety efficacy profile. And this is what we want to see in our Phase III trial, which is ongoing.', 'Ugur Sahin', 'Yes. And just to add on that, what Ozlem shared is, we have a profile allowing us to dose -- to provide higher doses. And we believe that this is particularly important in the HER2 1+ population, which is around half of the HER2-low population.So particularly, this is interesting in breast cancer as well in endometrial cancer and other HER2 positive tumors. And we believe that we can position here the product with higher objective response rate plus higher durability at this point.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Bill Maughan from Canaccord.', 'William Patrick Maughan', ""So I have kind of a two-part question about your ability to maintain market share on the COVID vaccine going forward. Just wondering how you're thinking about your ability to, I guess, defend and/or grow that just given, for example, I know tourists is in Japan with a self-amplifying RNA for COVID.And Moderna has previously made a lot of noise about their prefilled syringe. I know that there's that Pfizer is rolling out a prefilled syringe, but I guess, I'm just wondering how widespread that is? And if you've seen any competitive advantage where that has become available?"", 'Ryan Richardson', ""Yes. So we believe that we still [outperformed] very strong in 2023 and having globally above a 50% market share for the COVID franchise. We did see some market share pressure in a couple of markets like the United States. As you point out, we've also had market share gains in a number of other geographies.We maintained a very high market share above 85% in Europe, and also grew our market share in countries like Japan, which have actually been pretty sizable from a volume perspective over the last 12 months.Going into 2024, we do feel confident that we can continue to maintain a leadership position above the 50% mark globally. To your question on competition, yes, we do expect there to be some new entrants, mostly niche players in some of the peripheral markets.I think that you pointed out also the role of prefilled syringes, which is an important point. I think last year, it is fair to say that part of the reduction in market share in the United States that we experienced was due to a -- sort of lack of or limited supply of prefilled syringes.Last year, we did have some supply in the United States, but we also had single-dose files as well. And clearly, the market preference was for prefilled syringes. As we go into 2024, we have taken steps with Pfizer to dramatically increase our supply of prefilled syringes in the United States, but also elsewhere."", 'Operator', 'Your next question, case from the line of Akash Tewari from Jefferies.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is [Alvina] for Akash. We have two. The first one is on COVID. So for COVID vaccines gross margin, given that Pfizer reported EUR 5.4 billion for revenue versus your EUR 1.5 billion, and that you're exploiting gross profit with Pfizer, it seems to imply a gross margin of 60%, which is lower than previous levels of around 80%. So is this just because of the additional write-off Pfizer has in Q4?Additionally, I think, what's your view on gross margin in '24 and beyond for your COVID business, especially when the competitor seems to talk about a higher [GPN] discount?And my second question is quickly for pipeline. I guess how encouraged are you with the early signals of BNT122 in other consumers outside of pancreatic? And is there any read across from the pancreatic data that will be presented at AACR soon?"", 'Jens H. Holstein', ""Yes. Let me take the first question. To just clarify, Pfizer is, as you know, responsible for the commercialization of COMIRNATY in most markets, with the exception of Germany and Turkey, and we have a gross profit share. And that methodology works in a way that, of course, whatever Pfizer is writing-off on -- in write-offs on inventories or something that is, we're going a gross profit share and will reduce our revenue figure.That is what we are trying to highlight for the last quarters because we have been hit by around about EUR 900 million due to that procedure. This means for us, this is basically 100% profit for us before COGS that come across due to the manufacturing activities that we are responsible for. And they are limited.And if you compare the margin development that we'll have in '23 versus '22, you will see that we are above 80% margin. So you can't really read through from what Pfizer is reporting and really to our numbers that we report."", 'Ozlem Tureci', 'With regard to your question to our BNT122 and its performance in PDAC, we are very encouraged, not surprised, but really encouraged, and this is also the reason why following the data disclosure of our Phase I PDAC trial. We have initiated a Phase II PDAC trial in the adjuvant setting with BNT122, which is enrolling patients.The results we saw in this cancer type, which is considered as immune-suppressive and cold and low in tumor mutational load is encouraging us also to go into other cancer indications with this type of immunological profile. And in fact, in our Phase I trials in other such indications we have collected data, which supports the PDAC findings and which we currently are compiling to be published as manuscripts.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from TD Cowen.', 'Yaron Benjamin Werber', ""Right. I have a couple of questions as well. So maybe the first one is on 323. The ongoing Phase III study, the DYNASTY-Breast02. Can you talk a little bit about the powering and the PFS, and it sounds like if I remember correctly, chemo, the ORR that historically is 11% to 36%, PFS is about 3% to 8%. You showed a 39% ORR some sort of -- it depends how that chemo is going to do, which is kind of -- will determine kind of how the study works.So maybe if you can talk about the powering of the study and maybe a little bit if you can share any Phase I/II data on PFS so we can kind of just get a sense of what you're expecting?And then secondly, just curious, you have such a huge pipeline already and you've executed and you're obviously continuing to execute, and you need to grow the company a lot to continue to execute. What's the purpose to do and potentially more BD given that you have so much already?"", 'Ryan Richardson', ""Yaron. So I'll start with the second question, then we'll come into the first.So I think we were obviously very active last year on the BD front, bringing us 6 clinical stage or near clinical stage assets. We are going to continue to be active, but Yaron, I think we would agree that we feel that we already have actually now a very broad toolkit that allows us to do a lot. And so we are focused increasingly on execution.So I do think that we're going to continue to be active in BD, but probably not as active in terms of the number of clinical stage assets that we're looking to bring on board. We're -- the focus this year is going to be more on executing and getting the pivotal trials initiated and enrolled."", 'Ugur Sahin', 'Yes. To your second question, I think the second question can be better answered with the powering for a hazard ratio, which we usually do around 0.7, 0.65. And with that, we have a power of 90%. And this is -- this gives us to a study of around 530 patients that we will enroll.', 'Operator', 'And your next question comes from the line of Etzer Darout from BMO Capital.', 'Etzer Darout', 'Great. Just one question for me. On BNT327, (inaudible) VEGF PD-L1, you highlighted the program sort of prominently a couple of slides and looking at sort of Phase III 2024 and beyond.Just wondered if you would be providing any clinical updates for this program in 2024, and then what we could expect to see there? And any more specifics as well on sort of the potential path to Phase III and what programs? Or what indications specifically you might be able to sort of pursue with this molecule?', 'Ugur Sahin', ""Yes. Indeed, we will see a number of clinical trial updates on this molecule, not only indications. Just to remind everyone, this is a [biospecific molecule, which has PD-L1 for PD-1 blocking and VG -- anti-VEGF arm, yes.What we have seen so far consistently in a number of cohorts is the objective response rates, which are very encouraging in various indications. And what we have also reported already, our first combination trails in small-cell lung cancer and in triple-negative breast cancer for cancer patients.And what is really exciting in these indications is it's not only the high response rates in the range of 60% to 75% in triple-negative breast cancer patients, but also the response rate in the patient population who are negative for immune infiltrates, which is unusual for checkpoint blockade.So we believe that this molecule -- that we can replicate this molecule, not only in these 2 indications, small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, but also in a wider range of indications. The results, allowing us to position the molecule as a combination partner for classical immune therapy and even more importantly, for our ADC portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye from JPMorgan.', 'Jessica Macomber Fye', 'First, on the top line guidance. I think you previously talked about roughly a EUR 3 billion top line just a couple of months ago, and I appreciate you highlighting the variables that factor into the guidance. But can you just expand on which of those assumptions drove the change?And then second, on the pipeline related to the HER2 space, what are you guys going to be watching for in the DYNASTY-Breast06 readout as it relates to your HER2 ADC?', 'Jens H. Holstein', ""So yes, let me take the first question. So we brought in the range. We felt that the top line guidance should reflect the assumption that we've made with respect to the vaccination rates and the price levels that we currently have seen -- we're significant aware commonality of course, is significantly relevant.We also have made assumptions related to the inventory write-offs that it hasn't back in '23. And there will be some write-offs that we've got to anticipate going forward. So we've done some -- included here some assumptions. And of course, there are also some additional anticipated revenues related to our service business and the German Pandemic Preparedness contract that we have in hand, or we are finalizing currently with the government. So therefore, we feel we have -- that was driving basically the broadening of that range."", 'Jessica Macomber Fye', 'So each of those really factored into the broadening.', 'Jens H. Holstein', ""This is this -- there are some upsides, there are some downside that I mentioned, and we'll try to work it in with, of course, current assumptions that could vary over time, but that's what we've done, yes."", 'Jessica Macomber Fye', 'Got it.', 'Ozlem Tureci', ""Yes, with regard to our HER2 ADC, the concept of HER2 ADCs and the molecules, which are around, that's a great concept. That's very obvious. And we are very excited about our HER2 ADC, the molecule BNT323, which we have partnered with Duality.And as Ugur pointed out earlier, in HER2-low breast cancer are looking for making a difference in this high medical need population. You also have heard about our target of the hazard ratio, which we are targeting."", 'Ugur Sahin', ""Yes. And we can't, of course, comment on the clinical price of third parties."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Simon Baker from Redburn.', 'Simon P. Baker', ""Two quick ones, if I may. The 2024 R&D guidance of EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion is a step-up on '23. And against the plethora of studies you're running, that makes perfect sense. But I was wondering, is this the new normal? I was wondering what you could say about the anticipated levels of R&D expense beyond 2024.And finally, there's been an awful lot of deal activity in the radiopharmaceutical space of late. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on the attractiveness of that modality."", 'Jens H. Holstein', ""Yes. Happy to take the first question. So as you pointed out correctly, of course, we have broadened our portfolio. We have more and more late-stage clinical trials running, and those drive the cost up to a great extent, yes. And going forward, we haven't given any guidance here yet for '25, for the following years. So you've got to bear with us a little bit.But of course, late-stage clinical trials will cost some money. We will carefully look where we invest our money. We have shown that in '23 already where we had the same sort of range at the beginning and then we reduced costs, also reflecting the pressure that we have faced on the top line regarding the COVID revenue figures that we had to adjust during 2023.So there is some level of insecurity. I think it's part of our job to manage our costs here. And of course, we will do that in '24 in the ongoing years. But we will invest in the areas where we feel we create value for the company and value for the shareholders. That remains on top of our list going forward."", 'Ugur Sahin', ""Yes. And the second part of your question about attractiveness of regular (inaudible), I would like to say, and I'm repeating myself is that oncology is being in a transformation, and we will see this transformation ongoing in the next 10 to 15 years.And the transformation happens because they are new concepts. And one of the new concept is targeting tumor cells, but having bystander effect. And this is what we are seeing in value limits. So we have this targeting of tumor cells plus the additional bystander effect. And this is even more pronounced in the ADC field.So we will see really tremendous transformation in the oncology, providing us the opportunity to open up indications where we believe in the past, patients -- we can't offer patients anything. And this is offering now the opportunity to treat patients with advanced diseases, and not only with their disease, but bring in combinations and thereby ensure that even in patients with advanced disease, we really get a considerable clinical benefit."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ellie Merle from UBS.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is [Sarah] on for Ellie. Could you remind us the latest thinking about when we could see data from iNeST Phase II randomized trial and what you're hoping to see there that would continue to give you guys confidence in the program and moving forward?"", 'Ugur Sahin', 'Okay. Yes. So shortly, we will report iNeST data on our melanoma trial this year, latest in the second half of this year. And we expect the next update for our colorectal cancer study end of 2025.', 'Operator', 'And your final question comes from the line of Manos Mastorakis from Deutsche Bank.', 'Manos Mastorakis', ""So a quick question from us, Manos Mastorakis, Deutsche Bank. So just wanted to know what are the first Phase III readouts we will see for the rest of the portfolio in 2025 or beyond? And I'm assuming nothing major in 2024? Please correct me if I'm wrong."", 'Ryan Richardson', ""Yes. So we talked about a couple of different trials that we think could produce data in 2025 ahead of product approvals and successful. And that includes the Phase II randomized trial for iNeST and CRC, which Ugur just mentioned, there's the potential for an interim update in the second half of 2025 or early 2026.And we've also talked about the BNT323 program in refractory -- in second and third-line endometrial cancer. So those initial readouts are likely to be Phase II, but we think they could have registrational potential if the data is strong. I think obviously, the goal by the end of this year is to start many Phase III. Some of those have already started so we could have further data updates as well on the pipeline. But those are the 2 that I would point you to."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.""]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy in Africa.', 'Between 2000 and 2019, the healthy life expectancy in Africa was reported to rise by 10 years per person, on average. Improvement in life expectancy can be attributed to enhanced reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health, as well as the measures taken against infectious diseases. Essential health service coverage also increased in the African continent. However, the improved life expectancy still lagged behind the global average.', 'While the population is aging rapidly in many of the regions in the world, Africa depicts a different picture. As compared to the rest of the world, Africa’s population is relatively younger. As reported by the US Census Bureau, only 5.6% of Africa’s population was above 60 years of age in 2020 as compared to 23.4% in North America. The situation has been forecasted to persist as Africa’s older population is expected to remain in single digits even by 2050. Although the share of adults in the total population across Africa is less, these adults still account for a high number. In 2020, 18 African countries had more than 1 million people aged above 60. Nigeria is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa which has a large total older population.', 'Africa continues to be subject to persistent challenges which influence its life expectancy and the overall health situation. As reported by the UN, severe hunger had an impact on 4.3 million people in Nigeria in 2023. Furthermore, life-threatening severe acute malnutrition doubled among the country’s children aged below 5. Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal are other countries that are at risk of malnutrition.', 'Region-wise, most of the adolescent girls and young women giving birth are based in Western and Central Africa. As the population of young women has grown substantially in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent pregnancies continue to be an issue. Poor maternal conditions are one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and death among girls aged between 15 and 19. You can take a look at the countries with the highest teenage pregnancy rates to have a better idea.', ""The continent also faces a huge burden of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania, Angola, Ethiopia, Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, and Madagascar are the countries carrying the highest disease burdens. As reported by WHO, the African region accounted for 95% of the global malaria case burden in 2021. Tuberculosis is also highly prevalent as evident from the disease's estimated incidence of 212 per 100,000 people in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Similarly, HIV patients are in the majority in East and Southern Africa."", 'Additionally, non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and poor mental health are a concern among Africans.

Recently, the company has taken an initiative to improve the treatment of cancer which is a major non-communicable disease globally. On March 19, AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN) reported that it has entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. This acquisition will foster the development of next-generation radioconjugates which will be treating cancer instead of the conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Arexvy had an exceptional launch and generated £1.2 billion in sales in 2023.', 'Sales of the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, grew 60% at CER in 2022 and 17% in 2023, supported by the post-pandemic rebound and strong uptake and new market launches. GSK expects continued strong sales of Shingrix in 2024, mostly to be driven by outside U.S. markets where the vaccine is now approved in 39 countries. Arexvy sales are expected to be strong in 2024, driven by further penetration in the U.S. market, as well as early adoption from international launches. Over time, GSK expects Arexvy to generate more than £3 billion in annual sales.', 'GSK is also focusing on accelerating the vaccine pipeline, particularly the expanded use of the RSV vaccine, pentavalent vaccine and the 5-in-1 meningococcal vaccine, MenABCWY, to drive long-term growth.

However, with the threat of the pandemic easing, revenue from Covid drugs such as Comirnaty and Paxlovid has trended significantly lower, deteriorating the investor sentiment toward the company. In the past 12 months alone, the stock has lost a staggering 33%, highlighting a rough patch for the pharmaceutical giant.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PFE.', 'However, a closer look at the company financials, its drug development pipeline and the dividend safety reveals Pfizer is very attractively valued today.', 'Projecting the cash flows of a pharmaceutical company is fundamentally challenging because of the massive uncertainty associated with revenue from existing and new drugs. To get a reasonable understanding of expected cash flows, investors need to evaluate the patent portfolio along with the strength of the drug pipeline.', 'Pfizer is currently faced with the reality of a few patent expiries in the coming years, which are likely to have a notable impact on its revenue. Xeljanz, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, has already seen some patents expiring in recent years with more expirations coming up in the next three years. Ibrance, one of its best-performing drugs used to treat breast cancer, is also nearing the end of its exclusivity rights with patents set to expire in 2027. In addition to these, patents for Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Prevnar 13, a vaccine used to prevent pneumococcal disease, are scheduled to expire in 2026.', ""With some of Pfizer's blockbuster drugs facing IP expirations in the next few years, the company's success will mostly depend on the strength of its pipeline. The company has a solid track record of winning the Food and Drug Administration's approval for blockbuster drugs and curently has several such candidates in its portfolio."", ""Elranatamab, a drug developed to treat multiple myeloma, has shown promising results in Phase 2 trials. Ritlecitinib, a drug targeting hair loss and certain instances of arthritis, is in Phase 2 trials. If successful, this drug is very likely to replace some of the lost revenue from Xeljanz while opening up new doors for the company to expand into treating different types of autoimmune diseases. Giroctocogene fitelparvovec, Pfizer's novel gene therapy for hemophilia A, is currently in Phase 3 trials with recent results pointing toward long-lasting benefits in patients. Pfizer also has an RSV vaccine candidate in Phase 3 trials. If the company wins the FDA's approval for this vaccine, it would be the first-ever vaccine to protect older adults against the virus."", 'Pfizer enjoyed a cash windfall with the success of its Covid vaccine, and the company has been aggressively investing this cash pile over the last couple of years to boost its research and development efforts and to acquire promising biotech companies. In the fourth quarter of 2023, it completed the acquisition of Seagen for $43 billion in cash, marking one of the biggest deals in the health care sector ever. Even after this acquisition, Pfizer still holds more than $12 billion in cash.', 'In January, CEO Albert Bourla identified four strategic priorities for 2024, which do not include any plans to acquire new businesses. Instead, the company will focus on integrating recent acquisitions while improving operating margins by adjusting the cost base. When Pfizer executes these priorities, the company will be in better shape to boost capital returns to shareholders.', 'Pfizer has not repurchased stock since April 2022, but has consistently distributed more than $2 billion every quarter as dividends. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company generated just over $5.20 billion in operating cash flows. With the company now focused on improving its efficiency, there is reason to believe that operating cash flows will grow in 2024 and beyond, paving the way for it to distribute more capital as dividends or even to initiate a buyback program given that it already holds $12 billion in cash.', 'Pfizer has launched a $4 billion cost reduction program to support operating margins. The company, arguably, overestimated revenue from Covid vaccine sales for 2023 and 2024, which resulted in it following a cost profile that matched those expectations. With reality now setting in, Pfizer has been quick to focus on efficiency improvements. More than $2.50 billion of these cost savings are expected to be realized in 2024.', ""The lackluster market performance in the last two years has pushed Pfizer into attractively valued territory. The company is currently valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.60 compared to the health care sector median of 20, which suggests the market is expecting it to underperform the broad sector. The company's promising pipeline, however, suggests otherwise."", ""Pfizer closed the Seagen acquisition last December, and the company is now well-positioned to book synergies from this deal. The current valuation does not seem to account for this reality. The Seagen acquisition has meaningfully expanded Pfizer's oncology portfolio at a time when many health care experts are expecting the global oncology field to advance rapidly in the coming years, along with the increasing use of artificial intelligence in oncology research. Seagen's expertise in antibody-drug conjugates should also help Pfizer's ADC research efforts."", ""The current dividend yield of around 6% boosts Pfizer's appeal further. The company has hardly been valued at a dividend yield as high as this in the past, which is a testament to the undervalued nature of the company."", ""Pfizer is transitioning from an aggressive investment phase into a phase where it will focus on optimizing its recent investments to improve the returns on those investments. This transition should improve the company's cash flows and help boost investor returns in the form of dividends and buybacks. At this crucial juncture, the company looks significantly undervalued."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Year-to-date, shares of the technology company have outpaced all of the Magnificent Seven companies, excluding red hot chipmaker Nvidia and social media giant Meta.', 'View this interactive chart on Fortune.com', 'In an interview last year, IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna said he could see thousands of employees in “back-office” roles like human resources replaced by AI. Although he later backtracked, saying AI will create more jobs than it replaces, he again emphasized that “back office, white-collar work,” will be the first to be affected.', 'His own company used AI to reduce the number of employees working on relatively manual HR-related work to about 50 from 700 previously, which allowed them to focus on other things, he wrote in an April commentary piece for Fortune. And in its January fourth quarter earnings, the company said it would cut costs in 2024 by $3 billion, up from $2 billion previously, in part by laying off thousands of workers—some of which it later chalked up to AI influence.', '""This rebalancing is driven by increases in productivity and our continued push to align our workforce with the skills most in demand among our clients, especially areas such as AI and hybrid cloud,” an IBM spokesperson told The Register in February.', 'Reminiscent of the late ‘90s, investors have clamored to cram money into nearly any company with AI involvement (so much so that the SEC has cracked down on so-called “AI washing”). So far in 2023, this trend has led to surges in the shares for Google, which has its own AI chatbot, and Microsoft, which has a profit-sharing deal with AI leader OpenAI.', 'But while those companies have attracted the most buzz around their AI capabilities, IBM has been bulking up its own AI products and quietly outperforming Google and Microsoft in the public market.', 'The 112-year-old tech company has been researching and developing its own artificial intelligence technology since the 1950s and garnered significant attention when its supercomputer Watson beat Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings on live television in 2011.

We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\xa0', ""In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\xa0"", ""However, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\xa0"", 'It is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\xa0', 'Moreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as ""very important,"" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\xa0', ""Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education."", 'Moreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced ""new collar"" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor\'s degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\xa0 eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\xa0 internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\xa0 maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.\xa0', ""Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.\xa0"", ""Another observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates.

Firstly, it's typically more affordable, allowing students to save money on tuition and fees.

The smaller class sizes can provide more personalized attention and support.

Meta earned its gains the hard way, posting strong financial results in the last four quarters.', ""But I'm not a buyer of Meta stock right now. While Meta's recent surge might look attractive, the company and stock come with a few hard-to-swallow downsides."", ""Meta's big bet on the metaverse idea is not bearing fruit yet, its social media empire may be vulnerable to the incoming Web3 revolution, and overly enthusiastic investors seem to have lifted the sagging stock price far too high. As a result, Meta's stock looks pricey in a period of elevated risk."", ""Luckily, there's no shortage of better high-tech stock ideas today. In particular, I'm excited about the artificial intelligence (AI) growth opportunities in front of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM)."", ""So let's leave Meta to figure out its AI and metaverse strategies for the long haul while I give you the rundown on Alphabet's and IBM's superior shareholder value."", ""Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is at the forefront of the AI revolution. It's not a new arrival, either -- this company has been pursuing AI excellence for years. The YouTube video-sharing service uses machine learning concepts to find video recommendations. Google Photos, formerly called Picasa, analyzes your digital pictures to add handy tags and identify people. The route suggestions in Google Maps are based on real-time traffic data and advanced pattern analysis, again helped by machine learning. I could go on and on, but you get the picture -- Google has been around the AI block once or twice."", ""The recent focus on large language models (LLMs) and generative AI is kind of new, though. But Google was ready to face the ChatGPT threat head-on with its own LLM platform. Google Bard was renamed to Google Gemini and upgraded to take advantage of lessons learned by the Google Brain and DeepMind AI teams. It's not the only ChatGPT alternative on the table, but the other challengers are rarely seen as serious contenders to the generative AI throne."", 'Gemini has earned that level of respect. ChatGPT and Google Gemini will try to outdo each other with new features, better analysis, and more flexible data format options over time. But the real takeaway here is that the tech industry at large was caught flat-footed by the appearance of ChatGPT in 2021 -- while Google simply whipped out a respectable competitor in that exact category just a couple of months later.', ""And that readiness to tackle unexpected challenges at the drop of a digital hat is essential to my investment thesis for Alphabet. Whatever twists and turns the IT sector may take in the future, it's a safe bet that Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches. In fact, the company will more often take a leading role in dramatic sea changes such as the ongoing generative AI boom."", ""I'm not calling Meta a one-trick pony, but its social media focus does look rather limited next to Alphabet's broader range of abilities. Moreover, Alphabet's stock trades at 25 times earnings or 6 times sales. Facebook's valuation ratios have surged ahead to 33 and 9, respectively. In my eyes, you're paying more for a weaker company."", ""So Alphabet is a flexible tech giant built for long-term success, and I'm not sure I can say the same about Meta. Hence, Alphabet's stock looks like a far better buy right now."", ""Meta Platforms' future is tightly tied to fickle consumer tastes. Centennial tech veteran IBM doesn't play that game. Instead, the company hones in on business-class customers with large infrastructure budgets and grand ambitions."", ""The Watsonx AI platform is quietly winning long-term contracts behind the scenes. Big Blue's preferred customers plan to use AI tools in production-ready products, services, and processes, and there's no room for error. So each new technology must survive a gauntlet of technical tests, checking everything from security and data quality to actionable results and cost-effectiveness. Only then will the prospective client's IT director put a multi-year IBM deal in front of upper-level management for a final greenlight. These deals require a staggering amount of John Hancocks, and they result in long-term commitments that will be even harder to replace."", ""So it may look like IBM missed the starting gun on the race to generative AI dominance, but nothing could be further from the truth. It's just a slower process in this target market, and it would be unwise to trumpet your long-term IT plans before the new systems even completed the testing sequence."", 'Big Blue is building a giant AI presence behind locked doors. The evidence has started to trickle out as the multi-year contracts are stacking up in the form of unfilled AI orders.', '""Last quarter, I shared with you that our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI and Watsonx was in the low hundreds of millions,"" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in January\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""Since then, demand continues to increase and our book of business in the fourth quarter is roughly double the third-quarter amount. We continue to have thousands of hands-on client interactions, including an acceleration in pilots that were completed during the quarter.""', 'In other words, the order volume doubles from one quarter to the next, and IBM is aggressively pursuing even more AI deals.', ""This focus on steady, high-value clients makes IBM a sustainable investment in the AI space. Meta's risky bet on an uncertain metaverse future looks like an outright gamble by comparison. Furthermore, IBM's stock trades at a bargain: roughly 24 times earnings and under 3 times sales. Next to Meta's loftier valuation, Big Blue offers an attractive entry point into a company with a lengthy record of adapting to new technological challenges."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

The White House is loosening emission rules. This means carmakers can build more gas-powered vehicles through 2030 and still meet regulation requirements. To break this down for us, we have Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian. So Pras, walk us through this announcement.', ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, it's all fairly complicated and in the weeds, so I'm going to keep it a bit simple here. But basically, the Department of Energy is easing those guidelines, like you mentioned, it had for the EV transition, right?"", ""How it works-- so automakers have a thing called CAFE requirements, or the average fuel economy requirements across their fleet. They were going to go up in 2027 and in 2030. At the same time, the amount that EVs contributed to the CAFE requirements were going to come down, so you wouldn't get that benefit of selling EVs as much as you do now. It means automakers would sell a lot more EVs in that time frame."", 'As we know, the EV take rate has been coming down. Consumers have other preferences these days. So the White House and DOE are backing down, listening to automakers, helping them out a little bit by easing in the phasing of these changes to the EV mileage ratings through 2030. So that the net effect here is that EVs will probably make up a little bit less than 50% of sales by 2030, as opposed to what the original requirements were, which were over 60%. So this is a big win for automakers.', '- Pras, how much of this has to do with the pressure being placed by carmakers on the White House, who have said that this transition cannot accelerate at the pace that maybe the White House would have liked? How much of this is also about politics in an election year?', ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Oh, yeah. I think that's a huge factor there. The automakers were definitely pressuring the White House and the DOE on these rules. There's an Alliance of Automotive Innovation, which is the big trade group for the automakers. They've been very vocal about how these changes were too extreme, too far-advanced. It would be too hard for them to do that."", ""And I think you're also seeing the Biden administration looking at what public opinion is on just EVs in general and saying, we should probably back off a little bit. We still want this to happen, but not at the rate that we originally required. And I think some environmentalists like the Sierra group are not happy about this."", ""So we'll see how it all shakes out, but as of right now, a good sort of a win for the automakers right now when it comes to that transition."", '- Pras Subramanian is always staying on top of the auto story for us.

Investors were very pleased with the numbers. As of this writing, shares are up more than 10% from the announcement a couple weeks ago, and they are up 18% in 2024.', ""Investors might be compelled to rush in and buy this top retail stock with $1,000 right now as it benefits from positive sentiment. Before doing so, however, it's best to gain a more thorough understanding of what's going on with Target. Let's take a closer look at the business."", 'In the most recent quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $2.98, which meaningfully outperformed consensus analyst estimates of $2.42. That figure was also up a whopping 58% year over year. Target is benefiting from fewer markdowns as well as lower freight and transportation costs.', 'That appeared to be the only good news from the latest report. Nonetheless, it was enough for investors to drive up the share price.', 'When it comes to the top line, it was a more disappointing story. Revenue increased by only 1.6%, with same-store sales, a key performance indicator for any retailer, decreasing by 4.4%. Both the number of transactions and ticket sizes were down from the year-ago period. Management highlighted macroeconomic factors impacting the way consumers spend, especially on discretionary items.', ""Looking ahead, investors shouldn't expect things to bounce back so quickly. Executives believe Target will report a 3% to 5% same-store sales drop in the current quarter. They think things will stabilize and improve throughout the course of the year, though."", ""Over the last five years, Target has produced a total return of 141%, which translates to an annualized gain of 19%. That's a fantastic performance for any investor's portfolio. It exceeds what the broader S&P 500 has been able to do by an extremely wide margin."", ""But right now, shares look to be fully valued, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19.1. That's a slight premium to the trailing five-year average. And this current valuation incorporates the company's huge income growth last fiscal year."", ""On the one hand, investors will point to Target's favorable capital allocation policy as a reason to scoop up the stock. The business recently paid its 226th straight quarterly dividend. Just in the past decade, the quarterly payout amount has increased 151%, from $0.43 in Q1 2014 to $1.08 today. There's no doubt that this will continue in the years ahead. The current yield sits at 2.6%, which could be enticing for income-seeking investors."", 'Target also has nearly $10 billion worth of authorization remaining under its current share buyback program. Michael Fiddelke, the CFO and COO, mentioned on the Q4 2023 earnings call that share repurchases will be a top capital priority going forward.', ""Despite what appears to be a shareholder-friendly approach to cash management, investors can't ignore just how intensely competitive the retail sector is today. Target is experiencing softer sales demand trends at a time when some of its most formidable rivals, like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco Wholesale, are reporting stronger revenue gains. This is clearly not a good sign."", ""To its credit, Target just announced a membership program, called Target Circle 360, offering unlimited same-day delivery. And the leadership team is focused on product strategies and introductions that emphasize value and affordability. But again, these two moves will already be met with lots of competition, so I'm not optimistic that they can move the needle for the business."", ""I can understand why dividend investors would buy Target stock.

The pandemic significantly disrupted its operations, initially leading to worse financial results than hoped. Various economic issues, including supply chain problems, have also affected Intuitive Surgical in the past half a decade. Still, the medical device specialist has delivered solid returns during this period.', ""Though Intuitive Surgical still has some challenges to deal with (more on that later), the company has all the makings of an outstanding stock to hold onto for a while. Let's find out why."", ""Intuitive Surgical develops robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) systems. The da Vinci system is the company's flagship product. Though these cost between $700,000 and $2.5 million, the medical device specialist makes most of its money from its instruments and accessories segment. The more procedures performed with its machine, the more instruments physicians need to order, and the higher the company's revenue."", ""Intuitive's top line should continue moving in the right direction as long as it expands its installed base, which it has been doing for a long time. It ended 2023 with 8,606 installed da Vinci systems, an increase of 14% year over year. Furthermore, a general rise in demand for the kinds of procedures done with the da Vinci system should also lead to higher revenue."", 'The da Vinci system is used to perform a range of surgeries, from hernia repairs to colon resection procedures. With an aging population, many of these operations will become much more common, a powerful tailwind from which Intuitive Surgical will benefit. The company has been riding the wave of the increased adoption of RAS for a while (the da Vinci system was first cleared in the U.S. in 2000), leading to excellent financial results. Can the medical device specialist keep it up?', ""Several things could get in Intuitive Surgical's way. Let's consider two of them. The first is competition. Other healthcare giants, most notably Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, are trying to get a piece of the RAS market. However, both have some ways to go before catching up to Intuitive Surgical. J&J's robot system, Ottava, has not yet been cleared in the U.S. The company plans to submit an application in the second half of this year to start clinical trials in the country."", ""The U.S. is generally the most lucrative market, so Johnson & Johnson is far behind. Medtronic's Hugo is already running clinical trials in the U.S., but it has yet to receive full regulatory clearance. Even if those two companies join the market, the RAS industry is severely underpenetrated. As Medtronic's management recently noted, only 5% of procedures that can be performed robotically currently are."", 'So there is room for multiple winners here over the long run.', ""Second, Intuitive Surgical runs the risk that demand for some of the procedures performed with its crown jewel will decrease. That has happened with the recent rise in popularity of weight loss medicines like Wegovy, which reduced volume growth in bariatric procedures. But as management notes, these make up only between 4% and 5% of total worldwide procedures. Even if these are cut in half, given the massive runway for growth in the RAS market, it shouldn't matter too much for Intuitive Surgical's financial results over the long run."", ""Intuitive Surgical has shown incredible resilience in the past few years, handling difficult conditions and slightly outperforming the broader market. That speaks volumes about the company's underlying business. Given its position in the RAS industry and the opportunities this field offers, Intuitive Surgical could deliver outsize returns over the long run to patient investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.', ""At the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread."", ""Although Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024."", ""What's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January)."", ""But not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold', 'While some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.', ""What's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia."", 'No billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium\'s Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street\'s top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of ""Magnificent Seven"" components, including:', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased', 'The ""why?"" behind these buys is simple: They\'re respective industry leaders. Alphabet\'s Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon\'s e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world\'s leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple\'s iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.', ""But these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers."", ""Apple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone."", ""It's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven."", ""The second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:"", 'Alibaba (NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased', ""As noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages."", ""Tesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.', ""The final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:"", 'Oracle (NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased', 'Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased', 'Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased', ""Similar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure."", ""Western Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers."", ""To keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate."", ""Cohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Like so many things at the time, the seaside vacation became one of Britain’s cultural exports, spreading both by word of mouth and through expatriate Britons.

CROX appears well-poised for growth, thanks to its robust business strategies. The company has been gaining from solid consumer demand across the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, backed by effective pricing actions. In fourth-quarter 2023, its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 15th consecutive time. Buoyed by such upsides, this currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has gained 28.7% in the past three months against the industry’s 5.9% drop.', 'Crocs has been seeing strength in clogs, sandals and personalization for a while now. Each of the three categories grew double digits during 2023. In 2023, the HEYDUDE brand delivered revenues of nearly $950 million and more than $200 million in operating income. The company’s Jibbitz business has also been doing well for quite some time now. This business increased 17% to more than $0.25 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the total mix in 2023.Management continues to view personalization as a mega-consumer trend, with the opportunity of expanding the Jibbitz penetration in 2024 via better wholesale execution, deeper international penetration and advanced speed to market capabilities.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Crocs has been witnessing a decline in inbound freight costs, which has been contributing to gross margins for quite some time now. Also, favorable ocean freight rates, the absence of air freight and lower promotional activity in the Crocs brand have been acting as tailwinds. In fourth-quarter 2023, the adjusted gross profit rose 6.1% year over year, while the adjusted gross margin expanded 240 basis points to 55.7%, owing to gains from lower freight costs across both brands.Such factors make us optimistic about the stock. Crocs had earlier outlined its long-term strategy and key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. It had then expected to generate revenues of more than $5 billion by 2026, representing compounded annual growth rate of more than 17% by 2026. It anticipated attaining the revenue target driven by strong digital sales, improved market share for sandals, growth in Asia and innovative product and marketing. Management expects four times revenue growth in sandals by 2026. The company targets at least 50% of total revenues to come from digital channels by the end of 2026. Driven by strong revenue growth, the company anticipates improved profitability and cash flows through 2026.To wrap up, Crocs seems to be an attractive investment bet, given all the aforementioned positives. In addition, analysts seem quite optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $4.1 billion and $12.38, respectively. These estimates show corresponding growth of 3.9% and 2.9% year over year.

By the end of June, prices have historically reached near-peak levels (+13.8%) compared to the beginning of the year, while the number of new sellers increased by even more (+49.3%).

Amidst the current rally (bubble?), we’ve seen stocks rise, plummet, and rise again, pushing investors toward small-caps, tech, and growth stocks. But, while profitable thus far, that might be the wrong move, while blue-chip represents foundational stability sorely lacking within many portfolios.', 'The economic landscape remains uncertain, far from a clear path to recovery as inflation remains frustratingly above the Fed’s 2% target. Just one adverse event could send speculative stocks tumbling once more. With this in mind, look to these seven blue-chip stocks for stability, value, and decent diversification to protect yourself against the worst of the fallout if (or when) the proverbial shoe drops.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'U-Haul (NYSE:UHAL) dominates the DIY moving and truck rental market, far outpacing competitors like Penske Truck Leasing and Budget Rental with its expansive network of 23,000 locations and a fleet of 200,000 rental trucks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'But the company often flies under investors’ radar, even those looking for blue-chip stock opportunities. As noted by Barron’s Andrew Bary, “There is virtually no Wall Street coverage of U-Haul. It is run like a private company by the Shoen family, which owns about half the company.”', 'UHAL is currently valued at an attractive 16x earnings and 1.8x book value. Should the anticipated interest rate adjustments materialize with the Federal Reserve reducing its target rate, we’re likely to see significant activity in the residential housing sector. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.', 'This uptick in housing movement directly benefits U-Haul, as more individuals opt for the cost-effective DIY moving approach. Recent statistics show that only 22% of movers hire a company for their moving needs, while 37.5% choose to rent a truck and move themselves. With household budgets remaining constrained, a decrease in interest rates and an increase in residential relocations are expected to further bolster the preference for DIY moving, underscoring U-Haul’s strategic advantage in the market.', 'Source: xalien / Shutterstock', 'Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mounting an epic comeback, surging more than 200% following its 2022 slump, reasserting its position as a blue-chip stock. At that time, intense competition and faltering subscription growth dimmed its allure among investors, casting doubt on its status as a former FAANG heavyweight. But this narrative is swiftly shifting as Netflix reclaims its blue-chip media stock spot, underscored by its impressive fourth-quarter earnings report in January.', 'In a challenging year for consumer cyclicals, marked by tightened household budgets in 2023, Netflix demonstrated its unique position within our media consumption ecosystem. The company reported a 12% increase in overall revenue for the year, while its operating margins rose to 21% from 18%. Furthermore, Netflix welcomed over 13 million new subscribers in the final quarter alone, highlighting the platform’s enduring appeal.', 'Netflix’s strategy to enforce stricter password-sharing policies has evidently paid off, contrary to fears of alienating users who previously accessed the service through borrowed credentials. Instead, these individuals appear to have transitioned into paying subscribers. Should this pattern persist, Co-CEO Greg Peters’ assertion that curbing password sharing will “support increased conversion of our addressable market in many years to come” could very well materialize, signaling a bright future for Netflix in the competitive streaming landscape.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock.com', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a unique choice among blue-chip stocks, perfectly bridging the gap between “hard tech,” robotics, and global healthcare. A member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is lauded as one of the most stable and omnipresent manufacturers of high-end, niche medical hardware. Unlike its competitors, who typically focus on traditional medical hardware like MRI machines and the like, Intuitive Surgical infuses the surgical space with robotics and automation, adopting an innovative, high-growth approach.', 'As post-pandemic challenges within the healthcare sector ease, Intuitive Surgical is pushing forward with its international expansion efforts. The most recent quarterly update highlighted a significant 21% year-over-year growth in global procedures using Intuitive Surgical’s flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, alongside a 14% increase in new da Vinci installations. Supporting its status as a blue-chip MedTech stock, Intuitive Surgical also announced a 17% increase in sales and a substantial rise in net income to $606 million, up from $325 million. All in all, it’s one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.', 'Watch ISRG stock closely this year as the company anticipates launching its next-generation da Vinci platform shortly. CEO Gary Guthart has teased that this upcoming model will feature “10,000 times the processing power” of existing units, enhancing data collection, sensing capabilities, and overall digital and analytical performance. This marks a significant leap forward in robotic surgery technology and big opportunities for blue-chip MedTech enthusiasts.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Warren Buffett might consider commodity-based companies too risky to be blue-chip stock contenders, but Steel Dynamics’\xa0(NASDAQ:STLD) unique position at an intersection of old-school manufacturing and next-gen sustainability makes it an exception.', 'Steel Dynamics, recognized as America’s third-largest steel producer, stands out not only for its scale but also for its commitment to sustainable manufacturing. The company’s strong focus on metals recycling enhances its profitability by keeping high-quality metals cycling throughout global value chains, aligning with broader green goals. Offering a compelling 8.14% total yield, STLD attracts value-oriented investors with its appealing valuation. Moreover, the company has a track record of regularly increasing its dividend, with a recent 8% hike to $0.46 per share, marking a consistent rise for five consecutive years and maintaining a 100% quarterly payment rate throughout this period, underscoring its commitment to delivering shareholder value.', 'In 2023, Steel Dynamics celebrated its second-highest revenue year, with sales reaching $18.8 billion and net income standing at a solid $2.5 billion. Notably, the company demonstrated its dedication to its shareholders by repurchasing 8% of its outstanding shares over the year, a significant investment despite the higher debt costs and the expensive nature of steel production and operations. It’s surely one of those blue-chip stocks to consider for conservative investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'I tend to avoid most international stocks when looking at top blue-chip stocks (for a range of reasons not worth exploring here), but I make a definite exception for Taiwan Semiconductor\xa0(NYSE:TSM) in light of its current position and long-term potential.', 'While not as beloved as some top blue-chip tech stocks like, arguably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), TSMC is well-loved by industry insiders and analysts for its chip manufacturing innovation. The company is integral to the functionality of innumerable modern electronic devices and maintains its position as a leading supplier to the US, despite efforts to bolster American semiconductor production.', 'TSMC benefits from sovereign investment, such as Japan’s allocation of a portion of its $10 billion aid package to the company, part of a broader initiative to foster regional semiconductor development. The company’s financial health is robust, affirming its blue-chip stock status, characterized by minimal debt and an impressive 40% net margin. TSMC’s fiscal discipline has ensured its stability amidst the fluctuations other stocks face throughout emerging markets, underscoring its potential for extraordinary growth and long-term opportunity.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) seemingly stands out from our other blue-chip stocks because its industry – legacy media – doesn’t exactly scream “long-term value.” Historically, News Corp relied heavily on newspapers, books, and cable television. But, as American media consumption shifts towards next-generation formats, NWSA stands out for its successful pivot toward those emergent trends.', 'The push for NWSA’s evolution partly comes from Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently acquired a significant stake in the company. Following the investment, NWSA’s quarterly revenue jumped 3% year-over-year, alongside a 94% net income boost. CEO Robert Thomson credits these financial improvements to the company’s strategic move towards digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the unpredictability of advertising revenues.', 'This approach mirrors the strategy of many software-based blue-chip stocks, which prioritize recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For example, NWSA is allocating effort toward digital subscription acquisition instead of high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers Photoshop subscriptions for a monthly fee rather than a hefty one-time purchase.', 'This strategic shift is proving fruitful as NWSA also zeroes in on niche markets, notably its Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, showcasing strong performance. While NWSA currently de-emphasizes dividends to streamline its operations for the digital age, it still maintains a modest 1.55% total yield, balancing operational adjustments with shareholder returns.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Though travel stocks tend to be cyclical and, at times, volatile, there’s no doubting Marriott International’s\xa0(NASDAQ:MAR) blue-chip stock status. The stock had a remarkable reversal post-pandemic, but the momentum is only starting to accelerate when you look at the bigger picture.', 'The hotel giant commands a significant lead globally, holding 17.77% of the international hotel sector, with its closest competitor, MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), trailing at 12.11%.', 'Marriott is now targeting an up-and-coming customer base to diversify revenue away from pure vacationers and business travel by adapting offerings to appeal to remote and hybrid workers who desire both adventure and the comfort and amenities essential to digital nomads. Marriott is broadening its Courtyard brand to cater to this demographic, including new locations such as Bali and resort destinations, while enhancing existing properties with amenities like adding a lazy river to a Courtyard property in Tennessee.', 'Looking ahead, Marriott is poised for substantial growth as it continues to extend its global presence and capitalizes on the full return of post-pandemic travel.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Verizon Communications:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.093 = US$30b ÷ (US$380b - US$53b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.3%.

Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 9.3%. However it looks like Verizon Communications might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Verizon Communications is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling.

Despite the federal funds rate level (in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%) being the highest in more than 23 years, the Fed kept the rates unchanged and pledged to cut the same thrice in 2024. This propelled the stock markets to record highs on optimism that the rate cuts will buoy the economic growth, which is projected to grow at a 2.1% annualized rate, up from 1.4% expected in December.The recent spate of inflationary pressures, like that exhibited by the high Producer Price Index reading for February, had cast doubts over Fed’s proposed rate cuts this year. The higher-than-expected inflation data in the first two months of 2024 triggered caution from some Fed officials, while the markets appeared vulnerable to sudden downtrends owing to tempered expectations. However, following its two-day policy meeting, the central bank kept its benchmark borrowing rate unchanged and penciled in three quarter-percentage-point cuts by the end of this year.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and W. R. Berkley Corporation WRB are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better.

In comparison, the S&P 500 is up 8% and 31%, respectively. The primary reason is that York is weighed down by inflation and high interest rates. Because utilities are capital-intensive businesses, they are impacted more by these factors than other businesses.', 'York Water’s interest on debt jumped over 37% last year while the weighted average interest rates on its lines of credit more than doubled. Rates went from 2.11% in 2022 to 5.36% last year.

Like York, it is subject to significant interest rate risk because of the impact on mortgages. Since inflation came in much hotter than expected for February, the Fed may be in no mood to cut rates anytime soon.', 'Despite the weakness in the stock (down 9% YTD), Stanley’s dividend of $3.24 per share is secure. On an earnings basis it might not seem so, as it reported a GAAP loss of $310 million in 2023 compared to its $1 billion profit in 2022. But on a free cash flow (FCF) basis, there are no worries.', 'Because companies pay dividends from the money they have left over after paying their bills, Stanley Black & Decker’s FCF payout ratio of 56% shows the dividend is fine.

XOM stock’s FCF production has been even better, rising 11.5% a year for the past 10 years.

During his March 7 program on CNBC, Cramer wondered “how big is AI” and said the AI-led “technological revolution” is “crossing all barriers” and could potentially become the “heart” of the American national security apparatus. Jim Cramer said that AI could be key to making the “biggest amount of money” over the next five years.', 'Jim Cramer yet again took a swing at AI naysayers who he called “bubble busters.” Cramer said these AI bears are “all around” him and it drives him “crazy.” After discussing Nvidia’s dominance in the AI industry and how the company is expected to remain at the top of the AI food chain because of its high performance chips, Jim Cramer started discussing stocks that would benefit from the AI revolution. Some of these companies would benefit from AI directly while others would see a huge demand for their products and services indirectly.', 'Jim Cramer also attended the recently-concluded Nvidia GTC conference and televised his program directly from there. Cramer said that there are many non-tech companies in partnership with Nvidia and keeping an eye on these companies could unlock huge opportunities for investors. Cramer believes these non-tech partners should “represent the best opportunities” since these companies usually stay under the radar.', 'Cramer often talks about mega-cap tech stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that will grow because of AI. But in this article we decided to take a look at some of the lesser known and under-the-radar stocks Jim Cramer believes would grow thanks to the AI revolution. Most of these are non-tech companies that would benefit from the AI wave directly or indirectly due to the AI ecosystem that is forming as companies begin to develop generative AI applications for hundreds and thousands of use cases.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15', 'Jim Cramer is excited about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) after the company revealed its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer recently admitted he hasn’t been a fan of Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) in the past because the company became public via a SPAC.

Investors have rallied over the ""Magnificent Seven,"" a phrase used to describe the seven most influential companies in tech. The seven include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla.', 'These companies are investing heavily in AI, an industry projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, chipmaker Nvidia has seen exponential growth over the last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide.', ""Nvidia's stock is up 245% since last March. However, earnings per share (EPS) estimates indicate it has much more to offer as the AI market develops. Here are three reasons to buy this Magnificent Seven stock before it rises 40%."", ""Nvidia achieved an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs last year. The company's massive success in the industry motivated several tech firms to venture in, as well. In 2024, AMD and Intel began shipping new AI GPUs specially designed to challenge Nvidia's offerings. However, Nvidia has pulled so far ahead in the industry that it's unlikely to lose its dominance any time soon."", ""In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion.

Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow."", ""These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. Nvidia's declining figures indicate that now could be the best time to consider adding its stock to your portfolio."", ""As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position in tech. In addition to supplying its hardware to AI developers, the company's chips can be found powering a wide range of devices, from cloud platforms to video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more. While a spike in AI GPU sales is mainly responsible for Nvidia's stellar financial growth over the past year, the company has also benefited from a recovering PC market."", ""According to Gartner, PC shipments popped 0.3% in Q4 2023, marking the first such increase in over a year. Market improvements have been reflected in Nvidia's sales, with its PC-centered gaming segment reporting a 56% year-over-year rise in revenue in its latest quarter."", 'A leading role in AI and a recovering PC market suggest that Nvidia has a strong outlook in the coming years. EPS estimates seem to support this.', ""The table above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit close to $35 per share by fiscal 2026.

Today, most of the major U.S. news channels belong to a handful of gargantuan corporate entities. This has resulted in two major outcomes for the journalistic tradition in the United States.', 'First, because many news companies fall within entertainment media conglomerates, they tend towards attracting viewers using opinion and sensation. Second, while this may result in lower quality, it does provide investors with a profit driven company to invest in. Thanks to the cultural relevance of the entertainment industry, investors can more easily observe performance in media ventures.', 'As the 2024 presidential election draws near for the U.S., these media conglomerates will be vying for viewership. This competition cycle tends to temporarily bolster media stocks, as their prices rise with the increased attention.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com', 'Born from the merger of Warner Brothers and Discovery, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) owns CNN, with 80 million households reached annually. As CNN’s popularity and mainstream appeal has waned since the 2020 election, WBD’s position among media stocks has seemed uncertain. Furthermore, the company’s CEO, David Zaslav has begun re-structuring much of WBD’s ventures in hopes of stabilizing company performance.', 'With changes in CNN management and an attempt to redefine the network as more centrally-opinionated, WBD shows promise for 2024. As the race for the presidency becomes ever more sensationalized, the network that attracts the most viewers will be most profitable.', '2024 could prove even more fortunate for WBD, as the conglomerate owns Chilean broadcasting rights for the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, in both cases, WBD will need to shed the negative perception of its prior broadcasting ventures. If the company succeeds in a turnaround, investors should consider the solid coming catalysts for WBD stock price.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'With expansions in streaming services and sports broadcasting rights, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) has positioned itself for strong performance in 2024. The company also strategically combined its relatively new Paramount+ streaming service and Super Bowl broadcasting rights to organically market the platform. This combined with its relatively well-performing, mainstream news network, CBS, puts Paramount Global in a potentially lucrative position moving forward.', 'The company, however, has been entertaining mergers or even a private equity buyout. During mergers, it can be difficult to determine if a stock will benefit, but usually the target company’s stock rises. Moreover, the company currently partners with Comcast and uses its ownership of PlutoTV to increase Paramount+ access globally.', 'For the 2024 election, Paramount’s CBS network tends to market its 60 Minutes show as a beacon of truth. Whether or not this will work remains to be seen, but with the movement around PARA, the potential rises.', 'Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com', 'FOX Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX), the current parent company of Fox News, has seen significant turmoil since the 2020 election. Despite this, and whatever individual opinions on the company may be, it’s among media stocks that will certainly stick around. Much of this resilience comes from the fact that FOX remains ingrained in the minds of many American viewers as the definitive news source.', 'Such stability has allowed FOX to survive lawsuits, family drama, and the firing of one of its most viewed anchors.

That was made clear two years ago, when the ports around the globe were congested with containers. The cascading impact of the global supply chain out of balance sent inflation soaring and left retailers frustrated at not being able to receive their products.', 'This tangled mess of trade was the catalyst for the creation of the Department of Transportation’s Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) platform. The thought of data sharing two years ago seemed like a far-off bet but it was worth the try. One of the brains behind the curation of FLOW is Andrew Petrisin, adviser for multimodal freight for DOT.', 'Petrisin is referred to by some FLOW participants as “FLOW employee number one.” He was working for the administration during the historic congestion and saw how the logistics industry tried to unknot the tangled system.', '“The terminal operators were really trying to understand and forecast future congestion, as well as the future performance of the supply chain,” said Petrisin in an interview on CNBC.', 'Petrisin explained that operators were trying to understand when the volume of ships would essentially be unloaded and when the cargo would be out of port.', '“It was a very manual form of data sharing where we were getting on calls three times a week, talking through it with them,” he said.', 'It was during these phone conversations that the DOT saw there was a need to create a public/private partnership in which the data being shared could be seen at any time on a digital platform.', '“The partnership would be tech-forward and permanent,” said Petrisin. “FLOW kind of blossomed from there.”', 'The DOT adviser went into detail, saying that throughout the past two years the platform has grown considerably. There are at present 70 participants in FLOW and about 60 more in the onboarding process.', 'According to Petrisin, the total cargo volumes being captured by FLOW at some of the major U.S. ports is nearly 80% as it is booked. Announced Wednesday morning, FLOW has expanded its line of sight in the container-tracking process by adding inland ports including rail terminal and warehouse end-destination data.', 'The result is comprehensive information with visibility into actual demand, with real-time snapshots of port and inland network congestion.', 'Petrisin explained the data sharing on the platform starts with country of origin and freight volume to ports, and the freight is broken down by reefer, dry, rail, truck, inland ports to warehouse destination.', '“If there’s a silver lining from the COVID pandemic,” said Jim Bishop, director of marketing and sales for Union Pacific, one of the first participants in FLOW, “it’s that enhanced communication between each piece of the supply chain is critical. We’re proud of the work we’ve done to engage stakeholders, including collaboration with FLOW to better understand import volume and timing, so we can keep our part of the chain fluid.”', 'FLOW is able to do this through the aggregation of purchase orders from its shipper and importer partners as well as booking information from ocean carrier partners, to create a model of future demand.', '“We’re talking 40 days out for booking information and 60 days out for purchase orders,” said Petrisin.', 'On the supply side of the capacity, Petrisin said demand is changing daily so it’s vital for FLOW participants to see the interdependent nature of the supply chain system. Participants are able to use information on availability for chassis and terminal usage as a complement to existing data for comprehensive planning.', 'He stressed FLOW can be used as a proactive tool, and he is seeing it being used like that now as ocean carriers and shippers try to navigate current uncertainties around the Red Sea attacks.', '“We’re working with an ocean carrier partner essentially to use the purchase order data that is shared through FLOW to better estimate future bookings inland,” explained Petrisin. “They might receive bookings in the future to help them better do their service planning, working with an IEP or chassis providers to essentially have a better preview of chassis utilization.”', 'At the West Coast, the DOT sees the potential cargo shift due to the events in the Red Sea, and FLOW participants are using the data gathered to see the big picture and find cost-saving solutions. Petrisin categorizes FLOW as a collaboration tool with partners in warehouses who also tap the data to better predict vacancies and rates. Shippers also use the booking data and terminal data for assessing congestion potential and improving communication with partners on where shipments are and when they will arrive at their destinations.', 'Petrisin believes FLOW complements the investments being made on the physical infrastructure side at the ports or terminals and that the program is a long-term commitment for both the DOT and participants.', 'Jason Craig, director of government affairs for CH Robinson, said that for the first time, there’s a U.S. government office advocating for freight transportation.', '“Supply chains depend on dozens of government agencies — customs, for example,” Craig said. “None of those agencies have supply chains as their top priority. Now, there’s an office monitoring for disruptions and dedicated to working with all those other agencies to keep supply chains moving. That’s the main reason C.H. Robinson was one of the first members of the FLOW initiative. By virtue of our scale, C.H. Robinson has the industry’s largest data set on shipments, routings and carriers. So we’re happy to contribute our data to the cause.”', 'Paul Brashier, vice president of drayage and intermodal at ITS Logistics, a recently onboarded FLOW partner, and whose ContainerAI was folded into the platform, said, “For the first time, we are seeing a strategic executive branch effort to accumulate data and milestones and use that to identify and get ahead of supply chain bottlenecks before they metastasize. The data offers us actionable information when determining our logistical planning.”', 'FLOW is among a number of DOT supply chain initiatives created through President Joe Biden’s infrastructure law. In March the U.S. Maritime Administration announced an initiative to strengthen coastal and inland waterway ports with $450 million from infrastructure funding.', 'In January, DOT announced nearly $5 billion in grants to build or repair infrastructure projects geared toward relieving trucking bottlenecks and improving the movement of freight on the nation’s highways.', 'Launched two years ago by the Biden administration, FLOW has partnered with retailers including Home Depot, Nike, Walmart and Target; railroads Union Pacific and BNSF; and logistics providers C.H. Robinson, DHL and FedEx. The nation’s busiest container ports, including Los Angeles, Long Beach and New York, are part of the FLOW platform, as are top ocean carriers including MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd.', '“We’ve been working closely with DOT Secretary Buttigieg and his team to improve the efficiency and timeliness of America’s supply chain through data sharing and data analysis,” said Peter Levesque, CMA CGM North America president and CEO. “The FLOW initiative is a good example of what’s possible when government and industry work together to solve the big issues that impact the U.S. supply chain.”', 'An economic report by the White House found that more than 80% of recent progress in lowering inflation (disinflation) in the U.S. economy can be attributed to the supply chain.', '“This isn’t a one-month or two-month endeavor,” stressed Petrisin. “This is something we need to do for the betterment of the industry and the betterment of the country.”', 'The post DOT adviser, FLOW members reflect on 2 years of data-sharing platform appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Ditto for shareholders; the stock's still down more than 40% from its early 2021 peak."", ""Blame the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly. The contagion reshaped the entertainment industry landscape by accelerating the growth of competing streaming services while at the same time permanently damaging the theatrical film business. Like most of its peers, Disney wasn't ready for the rapid change."", ""Time eventually heals all wounds though. Now three years into the shakeup -- and with a veteran CEO back at the helm -- there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel. Walt Disney can be fixed, and the turnaround is already making progress."", 'Four arguments stand out as reasons to take a swing on Disney stock sooner rather than later, before the recovery rally makes any more progress.', ""When Disney first launched its flagship streaming service Disney+ back in 2019, profits weren't a concern. The media giant's first goal was establishing market dominance. Making the platform profitable would be something for down the road."", ""Well, the company is well down the road, but its streaming business (Disney+, ESPN+, and its stake in Hulu) is still in the red. The company's direct-to-consumer arm lost $216 million during the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30)."", 'These losses are shrinking though and will likely continue doing so. As CFO Hugh Johnston commented during the company\'s latest earnings call, ""We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business.""', ""This underlying improvement is partially the result of cost cutting. But future progress will also reflect a more optimized mix of streaming services. Disney intends to acquire the one-third of Hulu it doesn't already own sometime this year, for instance, pushing co-owner Comcast all the way out of the picture so Disney can manage and promote the platform in a way the best suits it."", ""Prior to the pandemic, Disney's film business was firing on all cylinders. In retrospect though, it appears the success was more about the franchises and intellectual property -- Star Wars and Marvel's Avengers -- than the filmmaking itself. The media giant's latest movies have been subpar, and its film business has also regularly been unprofitable."", 'That could be about to change, however. CEO Bob Iger conceded in an interview at last year\'s DealBook conference, ""[Disney\'s] creators lost sight of what their No. 1 objective needed to be. We have to entertain first. It\'s not about messages."" He added, ""And I don\'t really want to tolerate the opposite.""', ""It's still not entirely clear what that means in practical terms. It can take months to shoot a film and then many more months to edit and finalize it. The films being released right now are still largely those that were started under Iger's predecessor."", ""Now a year and a half since Iger was renamed CEO, audiences should begin seeing more films in line with Iger's vision, which worked when he was first at the helm between 2005 and 2020."", ""Generally speaking, proxy fights like the one Walt Disney and activist investor Nelson Peltz are currently in are a significant nuisance to the targeted company. But that's not always a bad thing. Sometimes, such a nuisance can bring about much needed change."", 'Activist investing outfit Trian Partners -- led by Peltz -- is working to put at least three hand-picked directors on Disney\'s board. As Trian\'s message to shareholders explains: ""We believe restoring the magic at Disney starts with a focused, aligned and accountable board, intensely committed to returning an \'ownership mentality\' to the boardroom. That, and a heavy dose of best-in-class corporate governance is the medicine Disney needs to fix its ailing shareholder returns."" With enough of its own voting members on the board of directors, such change becomes much more likely.', 'Iger and Walt Disney are pushing back, of course. They ultimately want the same thing Peltz and all other shareholders want, a higher stock price. The two parties simply have a different vision about how that should happen.', ""The thing is, nuisance or not, this sort of highly publicized verbal sparring often motivates management to make necessary changes ... if only as a means of fending off an activist investor's efforts to take control of a company."", ""Last but not least, while Walt Disney may be struggling right now, there's no denying the company's properties are some of the very best names in their respective businesses. Its theme parks are the gold standard within the theme park industry, for example, while ESPN enjoys cable television's highest carriage fees for good reason. Walt Disney also owns television network AMC and several other cable channels including National Geographic and FX."", 'Then, there\'s its incredible catalog of film classics ranging from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty to more modern franchises like the aforementioned Avengers and Star Wars series. Even Trian believes Disney has ""unparalleled assets and opportunities and every reason to grow and prosper."" It just hasn\'t been using capitalizing on them all that well of late.', ""But the potential is there. Whether it's Bob Iger who taps it or someone else, the ingredients needed to return the company to its former magic exist."", ""Concerns remain, to be sure. For example, it's possible the planned $7.5 billion of cost cuts expected to be completed by the end of this year could prove more harmful than beneficial by crimping the company's ability to attract paying customers. There's also no denying the ongoing cable cord-cutting movement is working against Disney -- a headwind that may not be fully offset by the intended 2025 launch of a standalone streaming version of ESPN."", ""On balance though, for the first time in years, there's good reason for investors to be cautiously bullish on this stock. Disney's management has identified its problems and launched solutions to fix them. But waiting until they're completely resolved could mean missing out on the bulk of any brewing recovery for the stock."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Comcast ', ""We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, Comcast's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 27.3%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.39 total annually to $1.24. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Comcast has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.6% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time."", 'Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Comcast is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.', 'NBCUniversal today (March 20) continued its efforts to demonstrate how it plans to bring TV in line with digitally powered ad channels at One24, the latest edition of its annual technology and developer conference. Several announcements were made around advances in targeting, measurement, commerce and streaming experience as the media conglomerate prepares for its upfront presentation on May 13 and hosting the Summer Olympics.', 'Apart from those tentpoles, the gathering came as the streaming wars enter a new stage and battles over the future of measurement intensify. Meanwhile,\xa0NBCU has reshaped its leadership ranks after several prominent executives, including Linda Yaccarino and Kelly Abcarian, exited last year.', '“We want the behavior with TV to look more like digital. We want to look more like performance media,”\xa0said John Lee, chief data officer for advertising and partnerships at the company, at a press briefing in advance of One24. “Think about how with a paid search, paid social or programmatic campaign, you’re optimizing up to the second — it’s one of the reasons to do it. You can course-correct while it’s still happening. I think that’s a pretty big behavior shift versus a set-it-and-forget-it, traditional mentality with TV.”', 'Central to NBCUniversal’s proposition around performance is the combined power of its One Platform Total Audience (OPTA) media-planning and activation solution. First announced in January, OPTA allows advertisers to generate a media plan across linear and digital channels using more than 300 audience segments that connect consumers, content, emotional responses and outcomes. In a nod to buzzy technology that has captured the industry’s attention for the past year, the audience segments use a generative artificial intelligence engine that is trained on NBCU’s video library and web content.', 'In beta tests during Q1, OPTA helped advertisers better reach their desired audiences, with 48% more households in target compared to using demographic proxies, per data shared at the press briefing. In addition, impressions were 28% more efficient.', 'The companion to OPTA is the just-unveiled One Platform Total Measurement (OPTM) framework that delivers insights and outcome-based measurement across the entire funnel, from awareness to conversion. OPTM focuses on optimizing mid-funnel measurement around consideration metrics like search engagement and site traffic.', 'Toyota piloted the new audience and measurement capabilities, with NBCU building a lookalike model using a combination of the companies’\xa0first-party data for the first time. The test saw a double-digit improvement in reach, saved double digits on the cost per reach and minimized duplication, with double-digit improvements across top- and middle-funnel norms, especially on Toyota’s chief concern, web conversion.', 'NBCU today announced that it is integrating its first-party identity spine with VideoAmp, stepping up a previous partnership to offer top-of-funnel measurement and allow for advertisers to transact around audiences for the first time. The company is also expanding its partnership with EDO around mid-funnel engagement metrics and bringing in Kochava for lower-funnel metrics including app installs, in-app purchases, website conversions and more.', 'Largely absent from the One24 conversation was iSpot.tv, which NBCU previously anointed as currency for national ad buys.\xa0Lee stated there has been a “narrowing”\xa0of focus after years spent canvassing and certifying Nielsen alternatives.', '“It doesn’t mean that we won’t do business, obviously, with other providers,”\xa0Lee said. “But the ones that you’ll hear us working with in OPTM really represent our most strategic partners [with whom] we’re going to invest the most of our R&D into building custom data integrations into this framework. We can’t do that with dozens of providers.”', 'NBCU has often launched new tech capabilities around major programming events, and this year’s One24 is no different. The company’s coverage of the Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games provides a wide-scale opportunity to offer new abilities for both advertisers and audiences.', 'For the first time, advertising during the Olympics and Paralympic Games will be available programmatically through a partnership with The Trade Desk that offers a private marketplace with biddable access. The move continues NBCU’s efforts to democratize access to TV advertisers and move beyond upfront commitments with major holding companies to a similar market of small- and medium-sized businesses served by companies like Meta and Google.', 'In the last year, NBCU has increased its number of advertisers by 40%, largely through expansions of programmatic buying. Along with bringing in new digital-first and direct-to-consumer advertisers, NBCU is seeing major advertisers adding programmatic elements for different types of performance-based campaigns.', 'The Olympics will also offer audiences new capabilities on Peacock as NBCU looks to beef up its streaming service before a period of heavy consumer use. Peacock Live Actions allow viewers to design their schedules with “choose your own adventure” type prompts, while Peacock Discovery Multiview is billed as an industry-first, four-view experience that could be clutch during the busy Olympics period.', 'NBCU at the same time is adding new ways to engage with consumers who have their remotes and mobile devices in hand with new and expanded shoppable integrations. The company is expanding its AI-powered, Walmart-fulfilled Must ShopTV to six franchises and piloting a partnership with Comcast’s Xfinity X1 that lets consumers shop for the exact items they see in “Top Chef.”\xa0During the Olympics, NBCU will also roll out Virtual Concessions, a partnership with a to-be-determined last-mile delivery service that encourages viewers to purchase beverages and snacks in advance of sporting events and TV binges.', 'The push to improve Peacock with content and commerce comes as more streaming platforms add ad-supported tiers and other media conglomerates step up their advertising-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) efforts, as competitor Fox has done with Tubi. But as Mark Marshall, NBCU’s chairman for global advertising and partnerships, said at the press briefing, AVOD is not easy and cannot be a “side hustle.”', '“We obsess about advertising and having advertising at the core of Peacock every single day,”\xa0the executive said. “How do we make sure that it is a great ad experience for the consumer, because we know if it’s a great ad experience for the consumer, it’ll be a great ad experience for the marketer as well.”', 'NBCU’s work in streaming and connected TV follows the continued growth of those channels as a target of advertising dollars and audience attention. But it also comes as advertisers are grappling with signal loss and the deprecation of third-party cookies. With logged-in, authenticated users and a new integration with Google and LiveRamp\xa0(alongside a previous partnership with Trade Desk around UID 2.0), NBCU’s offerings are an “encapsulation of the power of TV today,”\xa0said Ryan McConville, executive vice president for advertising platforms and operations, during the press briefing.', '“You can get great cultural IP, you can get automation, you can use data that’s actually future-proofed and not crumbling away like the cookie, you can do all that in an automated way for both big and small companies,”\xa0McConville said. “There’s not another streamer you can point to that offers those combinations of things and puts all those pieces together.”', ""“People think of the open internet and cookies for retargeting and performance, [but] when all that goes away, CTV or streaming may emerge as the best place to do performance advertising, because it will have an identity signal,”\xa0the executive continued. “You'll start to see not just TV be entering the performance space, but really start to lead it.”""]"

Previously, the department relied on contracted county dispatch services that did not meet its needs for real-time communication across the 110-square mile school district. With Oracle's modern suite of purpose-built public safety hardware and software, the department now has the tools it needs to support its goal of creating a safe and equitable environment where the students have the greatest opportunity to reach their full potential."", 'As a new district-dedicated agency, the department wanted to completely rethink its approach to technology to create a more agile, responsive system that would support better data access and action by creating a seamless flow of information between dispatchers, officers, and decision makers. After a comprehensive review of options, Oracle was selected for providing a comprehensive suite of hardware and software that could meet these objectives.', '""Oracle is leading the way with new technologies and capabilities in an industry that has been stagnant in its innovation and processes for far too long,"" said Dennis Weiner, chief of police, Round Rock Independent School District Police Department. ""We found the Oracle Public Safety technology suite to be the most robust solution for school safety and for law enforcement efficiency and effectiveness. As an early adopter, we have had the opportunity to work closely with Oracle to provide feedback that will not only benefit us, but other departments. This suite is a paradigm shift in how information flows more effectively through police departments when every second counts.""', ""Seamless communications with unified applicationsRound Rock Independent School District Police Department went live with Oracle Public Safety Suite in September. Using the suite's connected applications including Dispatch Command Center, Personal Communication System, Vehicle Communication System, and Records Management System, officers are now able to move seamlessly between locations and devices, such as going from a mobile phone to a tablet in the squad car, while continuing to send and receive information without disruption. The communications systems activate upon dispatch and record relevant data and interactions between the peace officers, students, and staff to support transparency, trust, and accountability. All this information is then automatically pulled into a case report which officers can review and update – saving them hours of paperwork daily and enabling them to spend more time out in the field. And as the system consolidates, analyzes, and organizes data on a single secure platform, the suite enables the department to provide a higher level of responsiveness and transparency in addressing community concerns through a constant and coordinated flow of information."", ""The suite also aids in the department's ability to connect to the State of Texas' National Incident Reporting System and ultimately to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to submit crime incident reports, as needed."", '""Oracle is on a mission to make work safer and more efficient for first responders and those they care for,"" said Steve Seoane, general manager, Oracle Public Safety.

This update brings a slew of improvements focused on making developers' lives easier and their code more efficient.Java 22, also known as Oracle JDK 22, packs in several enhancements across different aspects of the language and its development kit. These improvements touch upon the Java language itself, its APIs, performance and the tools bundled within the Java Development Kit (JDK).Among the highlights of JDK 22 are enhancements from various projects within the OpenJDK community. These include language improvements from Project Amber, which introduce handy features like string templates and implicitly declared classes. Project Panama contributes enhancements such as Foreign Function & Memory API and Vector API. Meanwhile, Project Loom brings Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values to the table, enhancing concurrency management within Java applications.Furthermore, JDK 22 introduces improvements to core libraries and tools, including Class-File API and the ability to launch multi-file source-code programs. Performance updates like Region Pinning for G1 aim to make Java applications run more smoothly and efficiently.These features are expected to aid cloud services and license revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2024 cloud services and license revenues is pegged at $44.68 billion, indicating growth of 26.5% from the year-ago levels.

According to an Orient report, the top programming languages include Python, Java, JavaScript and C/C++. Other programming languages from top companies are expected to give a tough competition to Oracle.C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft MSFT in 2000. It's versatile, object-oriented and component-oriented, allowing developers to build robust and efficient applications. C# holds the fifth position on the PYPL chart, boasting a market share of 6.73%. Like other languages in the C family, such as C++ and Java, C# is user-friendly and type-safe, meaning it helps catch errors during compilation rather than during runtime.Swift, introduced by Apple AAPL in 2014, is a relatively recent programming language known for its speed, safety and user-friendliness. Compared with Objective-C, Swift demands less coding expertise and boasts easier readability and writing. Consequently, it has emerged as the preferred choice for building iOS and macOS applications, swiftly gaining popularity. Currently, Swift holds the ninth spot on the PYPL chart, capturing a market share of 2.75%.Go, also referred to as Golang, was created by Alphabet’s GOOGL Google in 2009 as a statically typed, compiled programming language tailored for developing extensive and intricate software systems. It currently holds the twelfth position on the PYPL chart, with a market share of 2.04%. Moreover, being cross-platform, Golang facilitates the development of applications for various operating systems.Oracle, being a consumer-centric company, always keeps updating and adding features to its Cloud, Netsuite, ERP, Java as well as developing new products to compete with its peers.Java, a versatile, platform-independent and object-oriented language, empowering developers to craft robust and high-performing applications, attracts a lot of top companies.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 22.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 9.9% due to constant innovation which helps it stay ahead of competition.

We can now open up the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', ""And our first question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays. All right. I think we will move on. And Thomas, you can get back into the queue as time allows.And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen."", 'Hadi M. Orabi', ""This is Eddy for Chris. Thanks for setting up this call back. Two-part question for Sumit, if I may. The biggest bottleneck for HBM supply today is probably in back-end capacity. Please correct me if I'm wrong. In case your market share opportunity in HBM turned out to be better than you guys are expecting, do you see a scenario where back-end capacity may limit the opportunity next year? .And two, obviously, you have HBM taking away most of the CapEx dollars today and you have higher DRAM gross margins demand. So it seems DRAM and HBM may continue to consume the majority of the CapEx in the next few quarters. But do you see a scenario where you increased net CapEx this calendar year based on pricing action in that market? Or are you at a point where you think it's still early to invest in NAND despite the improving profitability prospects of that market?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. So I'll make a couple of comments, and then I'll also request Manish to jump in and talk about some of the items you mentioned. So first, at a company level, our goal is to maintain our bit share in both DRAM and NAND at fairly consistent levels. So we target flat consistent overall bit share in both DRAM and NAND. And it's not just one or the other but both. So we'll continue to invest in a very disciplined fashion with a close eye on how the demand is shaping up to ensure that our supply and our CapEx investments enable us ultimately to have that flat bit share.HBM is a very exciting product. We have an industry-leading product here, best performance specs, 30% lower power, a lot of customer demand, more customer demand than we know how to meet. And you have heard already in our prepared remarks and in the following Q&A that 2024 is sold out, 2025, overwhelming majority already allocated. So we are going to obviously continue to be very focused on disciplined investments and CapEx, whether it's for HBM, whether it's for DRAM, whether it's for NAND to ensure that our target of sometime in '25 getting HBM share to be equal to DRAM share, we get to that point. And as regards to your comments about where some of the bottlenecks in HBM are? How we look at those things, I'll request Manish to comment on some of that."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""Sure. So I think we're -- I want to start -- I mean HBM, it's -- our HBM3E is an industry-leading product, Eddy. And one of the backbones of that is the fact that it's built on our 1-beta process. And we've had -- I think, on this call, 12 months ago, we probably talked to you about the fact that we had reached our sort of mature yield milestone on 1-beta so a year ago. So it's the fact that we're ramping HBM3E on a very mature, strong industry-leading platform, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to build the HBM wafers.You're right that we are ramping our assembly and test capacity to be able to -- now that we've productized the -- we've begun production shipments. We announced today that we started production shipments for our customer and the ramp is on for us throughout this year and into next year. We've made really good progress on our yields and on our capacity and the throughputs within that capacity, we feel very good about. And feel good about being able to reach the targets that Sumit just talked about with regard to having our share of HBM match our overall -- our share of overall DRAM capacity in bits sometime next year. In terms of your question on CapEx just to Sumit's point, we make these decisions with regard to how much CapEx we'll spend in DRAM or NAND, both based on the demand that we see, but also independently, right? So I think we'll be looking at the market for -- and the demand for DRAM across all the drivers. And then similarly looking at the market for NAND and trying to decide how much we would invest there to be able to meet the demand that we see in that market separately."", 'Operator', ""And our next question is from Thomas O'Malley from Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Mine's a two-parter. One is I think capacity constraints was a common theme on the call that kept coming back up again. Could you talk about what is causing the capacity concern? Is it just the time it takes to put tools in your fabs in order to build HBM? Is it potentially a tool that you're unable to get? Just any kind of color on what is the limiting factor there? And if there could be some potential upside if something were to go a bit better? And then the second part of the question is you obviously have a public announcement with NVIDIA. But just given your capacity constraints, how should we be thinking about your ability to serve some of the other AI accelerator names in the market next year as well?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""So thanks, Tom, and welcome back. So I'll take the CapEx part, and then I'll let that -- and capacity part, I'll let Sumit take the customer-related question. So really, there are 3 factors, I think, in terms of the -- what's creating the supply tightness at leading-edge nodes. And 2 of them are common to DRAM and NAND, and then the last one is really unique to DRAM. But the first one is that we, as well as the rest of the industry have had significant capital reductions as we went through the downturn over the last 18 months.And so those -- the lower basis of CapEx that we've had and we've -- I mentioned on the previous call, WFE for us is down fiscal '24 over fiscal '23. So those decisions and the timing of that certainly impact our supply on the leading edge nodes, and it was done, obviously, as we have had very, very high inventory levels. So we're trying to make sure we time any increases in CapEx as in line with inventories coming down. And the second is this comment that we've been making, and we've been trying to be transparent that we see -- we have undertaken a strategy to structurally reduce the wafer start capacity across both DRAM and NAND. And we're doing that to be able to take some of that capacity and equipment and actually apply it to converting to these leading-edge nodes. It's a capital-efficient way to get the benefits of these new technologies. These new technologies in and of themselves have lower cost, but they also have better performance, lower power, in particular, 1-beta. Again, that's the building block for our HBM has higher performance and lower power than others in the industry and certainly than our prior node. But that structural reduction also reduces our capability overall to -- on supply. And those 2 factors are common to DRAM and NAND. The third one, of course, is the trade ratio for HBM as we increase the mix of HBM in our business. And as HBM increases in penetration across the industry, this trade ratio of needing to start for HBM3E, approximately 3 wafers in order to get the same number of bits as you would, were you to be starting at one DDR5 wafer. This also weighs on the supply capacity for everyone in the industry, frankly. So that's sort of a little bit of a breakdown on sort of what's creating this. And of course, our levels of profitability are still below where they need to be, even with the results we reported. So we are trying to be disciplined and make sure that we're able to return good ROI on any increases in capital investment that there would be, say, in fiscal year '25. Sumit, do you want to talk about that?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. Sure. So I'll talk about the customer angle. We have been engaged with practically all of the key purchasers of HBM in the world. And as you know, there aren't that many of them. There are just a handful who account for the substantial majority of the TAM for HBM. And our engagements relate to all of the product road map, certainly, HBM3E, but also closely engaged on HBM4 and the full future developments that relate to that. And of course, on HBM3E, it is 8 high, 12 high, which, as we have mentioned, we have already shipped samples of 12 high as well for HBM3E. Now we have made the announcement with NVIDIA, of course, but you know that we are in the early stages of a substantial capacity ramp in HBM3E.And as we get to more capacity, you will (technical difficulty) to new customers, our goal is very clear that in 2025, we'll have a more diversified customer base for our HBM products. And we are making great progress towards that with the allocation to customers for the substantial majority of our 2025 capacity. So we are in really good shape and continuing discussions with the rest of the customers."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group.', 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""You guys have been talking about 2025 as becoming a record year. And the team and Sanjay have consistently been talking about this for quite some time. What I wanted to follow up here is what happens to the overall margin profile? We understand that you may not be able to share with us a trajectory of a price increase. But when you think about what you're doing with the cost structure and the product mix, does that give confidence that perhaps on a gross margin, you can at least meet the prior peaks? Or -- and if you cannot confirm it, can you talk about the dynamics of the margin profile in a confined of a record year in 2025?"", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Maybe I'll start, Mehdi, and Sumit and Manish can continue to. You may want to go on mute, Mehdi. There we go. I tried to lay out on the general call or the main call the arc of gross margin over the next few quarters and then how that extends into next year. Price has been the dominant factor in the margin expansion over the last couple of quarters and including the second quarter of 19 points. And then this increase in second to third quarter of 650 basis points. Price is the dominant factor. But increasingly, price, while it will continue to increase into '25 and we believe through '25, other factors will contribute to margin expansion. Favorable mix effects through a number of value-added products that you heard about today, first and foremost, HBM. And then also just the resumption of more normal cost downs, excluding this HBM effect because the period costs are coming off and the node transitions are occurring and so forth that drive those costs down.So we can't -- we'll provide more specific gross margin guidance on '25 on a future call. But those factors of increasing price, improving mix, cost competitiveness, those factors will contribute to margin expansion '24 to '25. I will comment a bit more on fourth quarter. We do expect bits to be up slightly for DRAM, 3rd to 4 somewhat for NAND. And then for the remainder, of course, this calendar year, we would expect sort of flattish bit shipments, but somewhat higher mix of NAND. So I just think about that as you model gross margins the next quarters beyond third quarter. We do see, again, the improvement of stronger mix of leading-edge products and richer mix. And so we would expect in the fourth quarter to be somewhat above 30% on gross margin, and that includes, obviously, the effects of higher pricing. But keep in mind that higher NAND mix."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""The question is about some of the commitments that you spoke about on the call with respect to HBM. Could you go into a little more detail on that? It wasn't clear on the call whether those pricing and volume commitments extended into calendar '25 as well. And obviously, as Sanjay said in the call, it's not something that's very usual. What's driving that? And does it have any effect in capacity planning in that -- at least the HBM part of the business, you're getting better visibility as compared to normal."", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. I mean we do have better visibility into HBM for a couple of reasons. Number one, the growth in the industry is pretty substantial. So the HBM TAM and overall opportunity is growing rapidly. And you've seen even earlier this week, the Blackwell GPU has 33% more HBM attached and every new GPU that has been announced by NVIDIA had starting from A100, 40 gigabytes of HBM to H180 gigabytes, H200, 144 gigabytes and now Blackwell at 192 gigabytes. So there has been a substantial increase in HBM and hence, the TAM is going up and gives us good visibility there. The other perhaps even more important part is we are really feeling good about our HBM3E product. We spoke about the leadership capabilities of this product. Not only does it have really high performance, but all of the testing that has been done with customers shows it has tremendous headroom on the performance side for -- even going beyond the rated specs. And we have 30% benefit on power consumption and all of you know how much of an impact that makes on data centers from both an operating cost perspective as well as just having the constraints on power define the specs of the data center sometimes. So these are really good capabilities. And because of that, we are seeing a lot of preferential demand from customers for our HBM3E product. So in terms of the unusual nature that Sanjay mentioned, being CQ1 for the overwhelming majority of our 2025 capacity that we are intending to put in place to be allocated is a very unusual thing in our business. And we are not only able to have these agreements done with customers, but some of these have already included price being negotiated for 2025. Of course, 2024, volume and price is all done for the full year. In 2025, some of the agreement has priced already done. The rest of it will be done. My expectation is fairly soon. So the other aspect I will mention is that these agreements tend to have more teeth in them, more stringent terms in terms of commitments from customers and so that's another positive. And I think that's all consistent with longer lead times, more complex products and also the very good capability that the Micron team has created with this product and all of this is a testimony to that."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""And just to your point, Chris, yes, it means having this much visibility certainly does help with supply planning and justifying the capital that we need to put in place. And we talked about the margin structure for HBM3E being accretive already to DRAM. So -- but the overall DRAM -- our overall company profitability is still not where we'd like it to be. So we're being very disciplined and careful and investments we'll make for the rest of the business."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.', 'Karl Ackerman', ""I was hoping you could discuss which areas of the market you're seeing the strongest rebound in volume both in the May quarter as well as the August quarter? And secondarily, do you see a stronger-than-expected recovery in pricing in DRAM, excluding HBM and NAND over the next couple of quarters?"", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. So in terms of volume, I think, if I may just zoom out a little bit. Over the last couple of quarters, we had mentioned to you that our expectation was that PC OEMs and smartphone OEMs would be purchasing first because they were the first to go into a downturn and that is exactly what had happened. That's where the strength had been focused in the last few quarters. .And we had also mentioned to you that our expectation was that sometime in the first half of calendar 2024, data center will start getting normalized in terms of inventory and more normal buying patterns would slowly return in the data center. And right on cue, we have seen in the last many weeks, last couple of months, upsides in data center from our customers. And these upsides have serve to tighten the market. Of course, the PC volumes and the smartphone volumes expectations for calendar 2024 haven't really changed much in the last several months. They are pretty much very similar levels as what it was for end unit and sell-through of units. But data center is stronger. The traditional data center server sales are starting to improve. We're getting upside on the DRAM side as well as on the data center SSD side. And we're also starting -- we are also seeing obviously exceptionally strong demand coming from AI servers. And these AI server demand, of course, there is the HBM angle, which we have discussed at nauseam, but very strong DDR5 demand, and our DDR5 has certainly far more demand than we have supply. So we are chasing supply there on very tight on the leading edge there. And of course, the strength in the data center SSD is also very notable. So a couple of data points that we shared in our prepared remarks that I just wanted to highlight to you. For example, robust growth in DRAM sequentially in the data center in FQ2, cloud revenue in FQ2, doubling -- more than doubling sequentially. And data center SSD has been performing really well for us year-on-year, up over 100% in FQ2. And we have been hitting new record share levels as our share of data center SSD continues to hit new peaks for the last several quarters. So based on all of this, I think the pricing has been in a good trajectory for both DRAM and NAND. And the strength in the data center has served to tighten the supply situation, supply-demand balance, which is pushing up pricing and having that ripple effect we mentioned across all segments. And so that's how we look at it. And of course, some of the focus that you saw from us on CapEx, we haven't changed our view on CapEx. We remain very disciplined in our CapEx. We remain very disciplined in our supply planning. Our goal is to substantially improve our financial performance before we commit any more capital, and that's the approach we are taking. And you know that the lead times are very long in this business. You order the tool to expand capacity 9 months plus to get the tools and then you get cycle time through the fab and through the back end and another 5 months, we're looking at 14 months from the time you order tools to the time you get output. So that's really part of what was behind our expectation that we expect the pricing to continue to strengthen through calendar '24."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""I guess my one question and I'll leave it at that, is just as you see the fundamental improvement in the business and clearly a path to sustainable or appears to be sustainable free cash flow. Mark, I'm just curious how you're thinking about capital return? And it's been a while since we've got to talk about share repurchase. But just curious of how you think about share repurchase activity as the model moves forward and looking out over the next couple of quarters?"", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Yes, it's a good question to think about, Aaron. As you say, we're pleased with the improved profitability and outlook and also the continued working capital performance CapEx discipline that Sumit was talking about, so pleased to be near breakeven free cash flow. And then as you heard on the call today, expect free cash flow generation in third quarter and fourth. The balance sheet remains the highest priority. And fortunately, it's in great shape. We've still got very high liquidity, which we maintained through the downturn. I'll note our leverage has peaked prior quarter and has been coming down -- started coming down this last quarter.And it's always been low on a net basis. But we're -- again, we're in a great spot there and, of course, have absolute commitment to investment grade. Over time, as the free cash flow generation strengthens and as we said in our Investor Day, we intend over time to grow the dividend and then return excess cash to shareholders. So we're very much consistent with what we said at Investor Day and we'll be in a position at some point to make those decisions."", 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', 'And Mark, is there a liquidity level that you kind of think about or excess cash level you kind of think about?', 'Mark J. Murphy', ""We've put out there at Investor Day, we had this 35% of sales, but I'd say we have more than ample liquidity now. And again, it improved steadily from -- we maintained high liquidity through the downturn. Obviously, the outlook has been improving. And we're in the mode of generating free cash and we'll just take in a number of factors as we go forward. But nothing's changed from our commitments we laid out at Investor Day."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Mark, inventory was up. I kind of expected it to come down. I think you also thought that it would probably come down a little bit. And I know you said finished goods are down. So I guess, is that WIP is up? And I assume it's mostly related to the HBM ramp. Can you kind of talk about that?"", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Yes, you've hit on some of the things already. I mean in the end, it's -- listen, it was around where we thought it would be. It's -- if you adjust for the low-cost inventory that was in there, we were actually down on dollars and DIO. So I think inventories continue to track is consistent with what we thought. And importantly, we still see them going down on a DIO basis through '24 and into '25. We think we'll be in a real good position relative to our target levels by end of '25. So again, completely in control and things happening there as we expect. We're extremely tight on leading edge. In fact, a decent amount of what sold out in finished goods is DDR4. And then as you talk about what's building in WIP, is a sizable part of that is HBM and some other leading-edge products. So again, in control kind of what's happening in inventory is what we would like to be happening. At a macro level, it's going down. At a more tactical level, it's mixing as we need for the business and feel good about it."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""Yes. And I'll just add, it's not just HBM, but as we transition the portfolio to higher-value products, Tim, right? So data center SSD is another good example. And these higher-value products are system-level products, they do have longer cycle time. And so there will be a sort of the lengthening of the supply chain for that just as we gain more traction. Sumit talked about how we're doing it -- how well we're doing in data center SSDs and how broad our future looks there. HBM also longer cycle time and assembly and test as well. So that will be something. But at the same time, we're definitely focused on across the board, trying to make sure that as we kind of have this longer-term visibility from our customers, with them committing to demand with longer lead times. And as part of these LTAs, obviously, that gives us the ability to be able to be more lean as we do run things through the supply chain. So that's why Mark and I are confident that we're going to gradually be working down inventory as we go through the next few quarters."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Nicolas Doyle from Needham.', 'Nicolas Emilio Doyle', ""On for Quinn Bolton. On the call, you talked about total industry server unit shipments growing at mid- to high single digits in calendar '24, I think that's in line with consensus. Can you expand on the quarterly trajectory? Given your customer conversations, do you see a significant ramp in the second half? Or is it more stable through the year? Maybe traditional CPU coming back drives a second half acceleration? And any thoughts on how you're thinking about '25 server units would be helpful."", 'Sumit Sadana', ""Yes. In terms of the server units, the first quarter was not great. First calendar quarter, 2024 was not great for traditional servers but we started to see some of that demand starting to come back late in the first quarter. So we do think that Q2, it improves from Q1 sequentially and then second half of the calendar year is stronger than the first half. And it helps that the economy seems to have better footing as well. Most of the concerns around recession, et cetera, that were there last year have abated. And so the traditional server demand is starting to improve. AI servers are exceptionally strong. Our view is it is more supply limited in terms of how much AI servers can ship, but the demand for traditional servers should continue to improve through the calendar year. With 2025, we have an optimistic view that 2025 will be the first year in several years when the data center will be buying robustly for the full year because if you think about 2024, it's still more of the first half is when the inventory normalizes sometime in the first half of calendar '24. So the buying patterns would be starting to get normal only in the second half of 2024. So 2025 is the first full year in a while for data center to come back, both the traditional data center purchases as well as continuing robust ramp of AI servers in 2025. So we expect '25 to be a very strong year for the data center overall across both DRAM and NAND and across both AI servers and traditional servers."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel.', 'Brian Edward Chin', ""Maybe I'll kind of ask a little bit about cost road map here. Regarding the DRAM wafer conversion loss, can you touch on how we went from, I think, a 2:1 ratio to an even more severe 3:1 and also, if the die size is 3x, is cost also 3x? Or what's a better way to look at that? And then just a second part to that, what happens to the cost down when you start ramping 1-gamma? And is it likely that we won't see our 1-gamma qualified for HBM until HBM4?"", 'Manish H. Bhatia', ""Okay. So Brian, a couple of questions there. Let me start with the last one first, which is that we're not really commenting on HBM4 yet. We feel good about 1-gamma overall. 1-gamma is on track, and we had some comments in the script around it coming to market for us in calendar year '25 and starting to ramp supply of that in calendar year '25, and it's making good progress. In terms of the -- your question about how we went -- how the trade ratio for HBM3E how we arrived at 3. I think we've always said it was more than 2. And I think we're just kind of providing more color on where we're seeing it landing now. It's a -- there are a few different factors there in that trade ratio. One is the die size between the HBM die and a standard DDR5 die. The second is the yield trade-offs that are there in trying to be able to deliver a high-performance product with such a high die stack and a complex in particular, complex assembly and test process. And then the third is the fact that we now have a logic interface wafer that we need to produce as well, which also takes DRAM capacity. So we're including all of those in our trade ratio, and we do believe that this is similar for us with everyone else in the industry because the HBM die is standard across the industry based on the GenX standard. And keep in mind that even with what we've talked about today, for us, as we're starting to ship production revenue this quarter, it's already margin accretive versus the rest of DRAM. So we are getting a pricing premium for the higher costs that we're incurring to build the HBM product."", 'Mark J. Murphy', ""Maybe just -- maybe Brian, on that question, maybe just some housekeeping on cost downs. We do -- as we mentioned on the call, that the FY '24 front-end cost ex HBM, as we've said many times, is mid- to high single digits for DRAM and then NAND low double digits cost downs for NAND. So FY '24, all-in for DRAM, we would expect it to be similar. But what we're seeing is the benefit from this period costs and all these inefficiencies coming off is helping offset the HBM mix initially. Now eventually, that HBM mix is sequentially going to become -- if you're not going to have that favorability associated with the period costs rolling off, you're going to have an increasing volume of HBM. So you're going to see that, again, dampen cost downs and contribute to cost. But as Manish said, good trade given the favorability of that product."", 'Manish H. Bhatia', 'And Mark, when you said the all-in for DRAM, I mean, in front end and back end [all-in DRAM], we have similar range to what we said the front end mid- to high single-digit ranges. Obviously, including HBM costs would be somewhat...', 'Mark J. Murphy', ""And then on NAND, I mean, a little lower on NAND all-in, as Manish said, considering all the components and back end would be high single digits cost downs for FY '24 because we've got larger component [SSD NAND]. So again, premium products and good trade on that incremental cost. .I think as we look out to '25, we're obviously forecasting HBM to ramp in '25, fiscal '25. So that would impact cost downs in DRAM. And then likewise in NAND, you're still going to see this SSD mix and other things would, again, would be dampening cost-down effects. But again, it's a value-added [fixed rate]."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", ""For the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days."", 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.38 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", ""In the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.9%.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price has soared 109% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 23% in about a quarter."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' See our latest analysis for American Express ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, American Express managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.6% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago.

This free interactive report on American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of American Express, it has a TSR of 124% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's nice to see that American Express shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 42% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 18% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Operating income of $2.3 billion also rose by 6%."", ""In January, the company announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend. The $0.67 payment means investors are earning a 2% dividend yield from the stock. Yum! Brands has increased its dividend by 60% in just five years.

With 52% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', 'As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time.

There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$180m of stock.

ADPKD is the most common inherited kidney disease, with an estimated 250,000 people in the U.S. and Europe living with ADPKD; however, there are no treatments currently available that address the underlying causal biology of the disease.', 'ADPKD is a life-shortening genetic kidney disease characterized by the growth of numerous kidney-enlarging cysts that impair kidney function and can ultimately lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation, and premature death.', 'The majority of ADPKD cases are caused by variants in the PKD1 gene, which encodes the polycystin 1 (PC1) protein. These inherited variants lead to a loss of PC1 function that results in cyst growth. VX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule corrector that is designed to target the underlying cause of ADPKD in a subset of patients with PKD1 variants, estimated at ~25,000 (or ~10%) of the overall ~250,000 ADPKD patient population, by restoring function to the variant PC1 protein. Vertex plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-407 in healthy volunteers this month.', '""The advancement of VX-407, a first-in-class molecule for the treatment of ADPKD, into the clinic represents another important opportunity to transform the treatment of a serious disease,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex.

As an autosomal dominant disease, one affected parent can pass on the disease to their children.', 'In most cases, ADPKD is caused by variants in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which express proteins known as polycystins. The majority of ADPKD patients (~80%) have a variant in the PKD1 gene, resulting in a loss of function of polycystin 1 (PC1). This leads to the proliferation of kidney epithelial cells, increased fluid secretion and the formation and expansion of numerous fluid-filled cysts. The progressive cyst formation causes an increase in kidney size and decline in kidney function. Around half of patients with ADPKD experience kidney failure by the age of 60. Kidney cysts can also lead to severe abdominal pain, cyst infection, blood in the urine and kidney stones, all of which significantly impair quality of life.', 'About VX-407', 'VX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule corrector that is designed to treat ADPKD in patients with a subset of PKD1 variants, estimated at ~25,000 (or ~10%) of the overall ~250,000 ADPKD patient population, by correcting defective PC1 folding to restore function. In doing so, the aim is to stop growth of kidney cysts and reduce kidney volume, thereby preventing progression to kidney failure.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has approved medicines that treat the underlying causes of multiple chronic, life-shortening genetic diseases — cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia — and continues to advance clinical and research programs in these diseases.

The deal disclosed today allows Norfolk Southern to hire one questionable executive while permitting CPKC to leverage concessions to realize greater value from its transaction involving the Meridian & Bigbee Railroad, which it is pursuing with CSX.2 The deal also proceeded despite Norfolk Southern’s previous concerns about CPKC and CSX’s partnership plans.3 It appears the Board and Mr. Shaw struck a fool’s bargain that gets Norfolk Southern a short-term PR win while CPKC and CSX, the Company’s closest peer, strengthen their partnership and competitive offerings. Based on the real and implied cost of securing Mr. Orr, who analysts and investors have told us they never heard of prior to today, the sitting directors may have signed off on one of the most expensive and overpriced hires in industry history.', 'Norfolk Southern’s leadership took this costly and defensive step amidst an election contest, absent a comprehensive search and interview process, and without providing shareholders any say in the decision.4 We believe this action does not just deprive shareholders of the best possible COO and strengthen two other Class I railroads, but it puts in place an individual with limited experience as an operations leader and little involvement in any recent PSR implementation. The fact is Mr. Orr was appointed EVP of Operations at Kansas City Southern after it had already announced its merger with Canadian Pacific in March 2021 and well after Sameh Fahmy, our director candidate, oversaw a multi-year network transformation as EVP of PSR at Kansas City Southern.', 'It is important to note that the Board not only rejected the opportunity to speak with our proposed COO, who has received extremely positive feedback from shareholders, but it never even offered to have a substantive discussion with us about freeing him up from expiring employment obligations. It speaks volumes about the Board and Mr. Shaw’s motives that they would not even have an introductory call with a seemingly superior operator, who was the EVP of Operations at CSX when it outperformed Norfolk Southern on every key railroading metric (despite the wildly misleading claims in the Company’s March 20th letter). They made this conscious decision, which entailed an excessive cash payment and commercial concessions, despite fully knowing that our candidate is getting strong praise from the investment community, suggesting a disregard for shareholders’ feedback and interests. This decision was also made after the Board became aware of publicly filed legal actions involving Mr. Orr.', 'Based on Norfolk Southern’s repeated acts of desperation and factually inaccurate attacks on our people, it seems the Board and Mr. Shaw will do and say anything to try to stay in place. However, the appointment of Mr. Orr and the publication of seemingly fanciful financial and operational targets do not represent a ‘reset’ for Norfolk Southern’s reeling leadership – to the contrary, what has come out today only reinforces the need for sweeping leadership changes atop the Company. Norfolk Southern needs a Board that puts shareholders’ interests ahead of insiders’ interests.""', 'To recap:', 'Norfolk Southern has paid $25 million and given away a key element of its franchise to hire Mr. Orr, resulting in what we consider to be an ill-conceived deal that benefits competitors and harms shareholders.', 'Mr. Orr, who was hastily hired without a broad search and lacks Eastern railroad experience, does not appear to be the best available executive to implement PSR principles and help transform Norfolk Southern’s network.', 'Much to our disappointment, the Board refused to even speak with our proposed COO, Jamie Boychuk, who oversaw best-in-class operating metrics and network efficiencies at CSX.', 'Rather than putting the best people in place to drive shareholder value, the Board seems to be making costly deals and poor decisions at the expense of shareholders in order to insulate CEO Alan Shaw and incumbent directors.', 'Mr. Orr’s hire does not change our view that the Company continues to have the wrong CEO in Mr. Shaw and the wrong strategy in the form of ""resilience"" railroading.', '***', 'About Ancora', 'Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

If so, take a good long look at The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO).', ""Predictable? Perhaps. Lots of people certainly recommend it, and lots of people own it. Maybe it's even a little cliché as far as stock suggestions go."", ""Selecting stocks isn't meant to be adventurous, however. It's a means to an end. Your ultimate goal is turning a little money now into a lot of money later by taking as little risk as possible. Your top job as an investor is just finding an acceptable balance between the two. Coca-Cola stock offers a nice balance of risk and reward for three key reasons."", ""Experienced investors probably recognize that the economy's leading companies often make for relatively expensive stocks. Successful investing veterans, however, also recognize that paying this premium for a stake in a high-quality company usually ends up paying for itself."", ""It's an idea that certainly applies to Coca-Cola right now. The stock's trading at a trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 24 and a forward-looking P/E of nearly 22. There are some well-respected technology growth stocks that don't sport such valuations. But The Coca-Cola Company arguably justifies this premium. Its share of the domestic soda market stands at more than 40%, according to data compiled by Beverage Digest, and it's doing similarly well overseas as well as with its non-carbonated products."", ""The company isn't apt to cede this market-leading position either, for a couple of reasons. One of them is the fact that it's been marketing its products so well for so long that Coca-Cola has become an important part of the culture and lifestyle; much of its revenue is rooted in habit. The other reason is, by virtue of being the biggest name in the business, it can afford to advertise and promote its brands more than its rivals."", ""And it's not just its namesake cola. The Coca-Cola Company is also the company behind Gold Peak Tea, Sprite, Minute Maid juice, Powerade, Dasani Water, and Fresca, just to name a few. Being poised to remain one of the leading names in several different beverage categories ultimately bodes well for Coca-Cola stock."", ""It's not merely its wide array of perpetually marketable products that makes shares of Coca-Cola such a fantastic, all-around stock, however. The business model is brilliant as well."", ""Contrary to a common assumption, The Coca-Cola Company doesn't do much of its own actual bottling these days. Several years ago it began selling off the majority of its bottling plants to more localized bottlers and distributors so it could better focus on what it does best. That's marketing and advertising. The bulk of its revenue is now driven by the sale of branded, concentrated syrup to these bottlers."", ""This is no minor nuance. Bottling and distributing is cost-intensive. Not only does it require facilities and expensive equipment, it also requires manpower and logistics (delivery) infrastructure. These components of the beverage business were always challenging to support. But, in the wake of a wave of inflation since 2022, bottlers' profits have been severely pressured."", ""Coca-Cola, though, doesn't incur many of these expenses. Flavor concentrate is -- by definition -- concentrated into relatively small containers that are easier to fill and ship. The end result is a business with relatively low operating costs, translating into high-margins thanks to loyalty-driven demand for its brands of beverages."", 'Last but not least (and perhaps most important), The Coca-Cola Company is a dividend juggernaut. Not only has it paid one every quarter for decades now; it has raised its annualized payout every year for the past 62 years.', ""And it's not like it can't afford to continue doing so. Last year's adjusted per-share earnings of $2.69 is much more than the $1.84 worth of per-share dividends dished out in 2023, maintaining a dividend-payout ratio of around 68% that's been in place for a long, long time. The dividend payment and its growth have been so reliable, in fact, that over the course of the past 20 years the stock's dividend payments have been almost as rewarding as the stock's capital gains. Moreover, had you reinvested those dividends in more shares of the stock, an annualized growth rate of less than 5% would be improved to nearly 8%."", ""There are faster-growing stocks in the market, some of which even pay respectable dividends. There aren't many alternatives currently sporting a dividend yield that's close to Coca-Cola's 3.2%, however, that also\xa0offer the same sort of reliability."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Here's why each dividend stock is underperforming the S&P 500 and what it can do to turn things around."", 'Lee Samaha (Apple): This year\'s hot investing words are ""artificial intelligence,"" and Apple\'s stock may have fallen out of favor due to its relative lack of exposure to the theme. Still, value investors won\'t care much about that, as the stock\'s 10% decline in 2024 is moving it into value territory.', ""While there are concerns over slowing smartphone sales growth, not least in China, and Apple's year-over-year growth in product sales was minimal in the first quarter of its financial 2024, the long-term value case for the stock is based on its higher-margin services growth."", ""In Q1 2019, Apple's revenue share from services was just 13.8%, but that's up to 19.3% in the recently reported fourth quarter. That increase comes down to an 82% rise in services sales, compared to just 22% for products."", ""Given that Apple's services come with roughly double the gross profit margin of its products (around 70%, compared to mid-35% for products), Apple's gross profit margin increased from 38.4% to 45.9% over the period outlined above."", 'The increase highlights the value case for the stock -- long-term margin expansion from growing services revenue on the back of expanding its installed base of products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That installed base stands at 2.2 billion devices , and its paid subscriptions grew at a double-digit rate in its recently reported quarter. As such, Apple looks set for excellent long-term sales growth with margin expansion leading to earnings and cash flow growth.', 'Apple only has a 0.6% dividend yield, but it has raised its dividend every year since 2013.', 'Because it is such a massive company, Apple pays the second most dividends of any U.S.-based company, ahead of ExxonMobil and behind only Microsoft.', 'Trading on 24.7 times its estimated free cash flow in 2024, Apple is not a screaming value stock. But if the market keeps selling the stock off, then value investors will eventually step in.', ""Scott Levine (Chevron): It's been a rough road for Chevron stock over the past year. While the S&P 500 has soared almost 34%, shares of Chevron have headed in the other direction, sinking almost 2%. Savvy investors know that sometimes when the market punishes a stock, it provides a great buying opportunity -- an insight that value investors understand well. This is clearly the case with Chevron. While shares may be out of favor now, those who are patient can pick up a quality stock at a discount. Plus, they can get paid while they wait for the stock to rebound, thanks to its forward dividend yield of 4.2%."", 'Currently, shares of Chevron are sitting in the bargain bin. Priced at 7.5 times operating cash flow, Chevron stock is trading at a discount to its five-year average cash flow valuation of 8.4. Prefer the price-to-earnings ratio? No problem. The stock still seems inexpensive, trading at 13.6 times trailing earnings, while its five-year average P/E is 14.7.', ""There are a few reasons why forward-looking investors will want to gas up on Chevron stock now. For one, management is taking a judicious approach to the payout. Over the past three years, Chevron's payout ratio has averaged a conservative 49.8%. Chevron is also developing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian, where it expects production to grow 10% in 2024 compared to 2023."", ""While the price of oil has ebbed from when West Texas Intermediate, the North American oil benchmark, was trading over $100 per barrel in 2022, it has been rising lately, which may give Chevron stock a boost. Even if it doesn't, though, Chevron stock is a smart way to generate strong passive income -- a strategy of which the Oracle of Omaha is well aware."", ""Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke will generally underperform in a growth-led bull market and outperform during a bear market.

But still, Coke has underperformed the market, which is expected because the market has done so well over the period."", 'However, when growth stocks collapsed in 2022, and the market had a terrible year, Coke came through big time and outperformed the index by 26 percentage points.', ""The best way to invest in Coke isn't to try to beat the market, but to collect a steady stream of passive income from a reliable company. With limited ways to expand the business beyond strategic mergers and acquisitions -- which Coke has done an excellent job of over the last few years -- it's pretty much impossible for the company to keep pace with a growth-fueled market."", ""However, there are signs that Coke is becoming a higher-quality company. Its price raises were a massive success as the company navigated supply chain constraints and offset inflationary effects. Its operating margin is over 28.3%, which is impressively high. For context, Apple's operating margin is 30.8%."", ""The main reason why Berkshire has held Coke for over 30 years is because of the company's growing dividend and buybacks, which reward shareholders without the need to sell stock."", ""With a yield of 3.2% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.2, Coke isn't that expensive, and it yields more than double the S&P 500."", 'Coke is a perfect fit for investors who are focused on capital preservation instead of capital appreciation, are looking to supplement income in retirement, or are risk-averse.

Pepsi reached an agreement with the sandwich chain to become its sole drink supplier across all U.S. stores, replacing Coca-Cola,, Subway announced Tuesday. Subway also extended its preexistent contract with Pepsi-subsidiary Frito-Lay, which will provide snacks to the chain through 2030.', '“For nearly twenty years, The Coca-Cola Company has proudly served Subway restaurants in the U.S,” Coca-Cola told Fortune in a statement. “We are committed to serving Subway through the end of this year and will remain focused on delivering value for Subway, their Franchisee Partners, and consumers.”', 'Subway customers will begin to see products like Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke replaced with Mountain Dew, Tropicana, and Gatorade starting in January 2025.', 'The deal is the latest step the snack and drink conglomerate has taken to usurp Coca-Cola as the highest-valued beverage company. Stocking Coke products in all 20,000 of its U.S. stores, Subway was Coca-Cola’s biggest fountain account by number of store locations, per Beverage Digest. Subway has about 37,000 locations worldwide.', 'These supplier switches aren’t unprecedented. On Monday, Cincinnati chain Skyline Chili announced it would switch from Pepsi to Coke products starting next month. Its midwestern neighbor, Wisconsin burger chain Culver’s, made the same switch in January 2023.', 'Subway has hung its hat on consistent positive same-store sales, including a 6.4% increase in global same-store sales in 2023 compared to the year before. It announced Tuesday a franchise agreement with private investment fund McWin that would see it open 600 new stores across Europe.', 'Some of Subway’s good fortune could also rub off on Pepsi, which saw slowed fourth-quarter revenue growth due to repeated price hikes, despite posting profits that exceeded expectations and 5.9% net revenue performance for the year.', 'Meanwhile, Coke posted a $641 million fourth-quarter gross profit, a 7% leap from the same period the year before. Net revenues grew 6% for 2023, according to its earnings report. Even with the loss of Subway, Coca-Cola still has something that Pepsi doesn’t: growing sales volumes. It had 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales, per its earnings.', 'The two beverage giants have traded blows for decades and if Subway’s deal with Pepsi is any indication, the two companies will continue to battle for the top spot in the beverage industry.', 'The soda industry in general has been hurt by high prices, weight loss drugs, and Gen Z’s interest in healthier drink alternatives, yet Coke and Pepsi’s strategies have differed in trying to compete with one another.', 'Coke has been helped by its away-from-home sales—like in movie theaters and restaurants—in the past and has relied on international markets in Mexico and Germany to prop up sagging U.S. demand. The company also uses independent bottlers while Pepsi owns about 75% of its North American bottling operations. Meaning, Coke has to invest fewer resources in packaging beverages. While Coke has mastered the drinks market, Pepsi’s success has been in huge part because of Frito-Lay, which nearly matched Pepsi’s beverage revenue for most of 2023.', 'Both behemoths are taking big swings to attract Gen Z consumers: Coke recently launched a spicy flavor and “Happy Tears,” a salty, sugar-free soda sold in a chrome briefcase only on TikTok Shop. Pepsi’s Doritos-flavored cocktail and promotion of its savory snacks as side dishes for meals similarly appeal to younger audiences.', 'In a hat tip to its beverage market, next week Pepsi will launch its first new product line in six years: Bubly Burst, a lightly sweetened seltzer that piggybacks on the Bubly line originally launched in 2018 to compete with La Croix. It’s part of Pepsi’s growing interest in better-for-you beverages that have surged in popularity among young people. Olipop, an independent company which brands itself as a healthy soda, is targeting $400 million in sales this year, up from $250 million last year.', '“The biggest challenge will probably be just making sure that the product is like something people actually want to buy in bulk,” Nik Sharma, CEO of brand strategy agency Sharma Brands, told Modern Retail.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

If you would like to skip our discussion on the economic impact of national parks, you can go to the 5 Most Visited US National Parks.', 'Usually created and protected by national governments, national parks are generally a reserve of natural and unique land that governments declare protected. These areas help to preserve and highlight some of the most distinctive historical and cultural resources. National parks offer many economic advantages as they serve as tourist attractions and uplift the communities living around these areas. Research indicates that households near these protected areas, particularly those with tourism, experience an increase in wealth of up to 17% and a reduced risk of poverty by 16% compared to similar households located farther away.', ""According to the National Park Service (NPS) data from 2022, 312 million visitors spent a total of $23.9 billion within a 60-mile radius of national parks. This spending generated approximately 378,400 jobs and added $50 billion to the US economy. In comparison, the NPS's budget allocation was $3.3 billion, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of over 15% for spending on national parks. The US National Park System oversees 425 official parks spread across all 50 states, Washington DC, and several US territories. Among them, 63 sites are designated as national parks, including popular destinations such as Acadia, Everglades, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone National Parks, which rank among the most visited national parks in the world."", ""Typically, the largest parks attract the most visitors due to their exceptional beauty. In 2023, the number of visitors to US national parks reached 325.5 million, reflecting a continuous growth trend. This influx of visitors also attracts businesses that see contributing to the NPS as a part of their corporate identity and branding efforts. Notable examples include Tupperware Brands Corporation (NYSE:TUP), General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), and Subaru Corporation (TYO:7270), all of which contribute to the NPS as part of their branding and product positioning strategies. Tupperware has installed over 65 water-filling stations, while General Mills, Inc.'s (NYSE:GIS) Nature Valley brand focuses on restoring hiking trails, aligning with its outdoor, activity-based brand image.

This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022.

However, the portfolio of his charitable foundation outside of Microsoft is generally far removed from the technology sector. One of such holding is Waste Management Inc. (NYSE:WM), which has been a big winner for his foundation since it was added to its porfolio in 2002.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PLTR.', 'As its name suggests, Waste Management is in the waste disposal business. It is involved in the collection and disposal of trash, as well as material processing, recycling and recycling brokerage services. It owns a network of trucks, landfills, transfer stations and material recovery stations, which are used to recover items that are recyclable.', 'The company has been very involved in green technology as well. Its renewable energy segment converts landfill gas into renewable energy, including renewable natural gas, electricity and steam. The company gets royalties from third-party facilities to which it provides landfill gas.', 'Waste disposal tends to be a steady growing business. Over the last few years, Waste Management has been focused on driving price, while willing to sacrifice some lower-margin business. This formula allows the company to steadily grow its core Disposal and Collections revenue by mid-single digits each year. 2023 was a typical year for this algorithm, in which this segment saw its revenue grow 6% to $18.90 billion. For 2024, the company is looking to increase its prices by 6% to 6.5%. Volumes are expected to rise a modest 1%.', 'Waste Management is also in the process of undertaking several high-return sustainability growth projects. The company currently is in the midst of spending between $2.80 billion and $2.90 billion on these projects from 2022 through 2026. Once complete, it is forecasting these projects will add approximately $800 million in annual Ebitda. It recorded $5.90 billon in adjusted Ebitda in 2023. There are some commodity price sensitivities with these projections, which assumes it gets $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. Among the projects set to be complete this year are five renewable natural gas facilities set to go online by year end.', 'The company is also focused on labor cost management. This coincides with investments the company is making into technology and automation. It is on track to finish automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add three recycling facilities in new markets this year. Increasing its use of automation in these facilities has been helping Waste Management nicely improve its operating margins. It saw a 90-basis point increase in adjusted operating Ebitda margin in 2023 to 28.90%. It is looking for these initiatives to increase adjusted operating margins by another 30 basis points this year.', 'Waste Management will also look toward mergers and acquisitions to help bolster its results. It said its tuck-in acquisition pipeline is currently robust, so it expects 2024 activity to be higher than normal. However, the company plans to take a disciplined approach, especially given the high return nature of its growth projects. Currently, it is looking to invest between $100 million and $200 million in bolt-on acquisitions.', ""When it comes to risks, the economy remains front and center, just like many other businesses. While its residential business tends to be pretty steady throughout economic cycle, its commercial and industrial businesses can be a bit more economically sensitive. In general, though, more consumption creates more waste, and less consumption creates less waste. A weak market for consumer goods can also lower demand for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging, which can impact Waste Management's recycling business as well."", 'Competitors chasing volumes and looking to undercut on pricing is another risk. This is a large industry with many different competitors, both large and small. The waste disposal industry has gone through periods of chasing volumes, although more recently it has shied away from doing this to the benefit of all in the industry.', 'Waste Management also does have commodity exposure with its recycling business, and this can impact its results. For example, average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities were down 40% in 2023. This led to a 17% decline in its recycling segment to $1.26 billion.', 'Waste Management trades at 15.70 times adjusted Ebitda based on 2024 analyst estimates of $6.40 billion and at 14.50 times the 2025 consensus of $6.95 billion.', 'On a price-earnings basis, its valued at over 30 times the 2024 consensus of $6.94 and about 27 times the 2024 consensus of $7.79.', 'It is projected to grow revenue by 6.50% both this year and next.', 'If Waste Management can continue to grow its core revenue at 6% per year, mostly through pricing, while improving adjusted Ebitda margins by 110 basis points over the next three years to 30%, the company would generate $7.3 billion in adjusted Ebitda from its current operations. Add in another $700 million from its growth projects and its 2026 adjusted Ebitda would be $8 billion in 2026.', 'The stock has traded between 13 and 17 times Ebitda over the past five years.', 'Based on that $8 billion in 2026 Ebitda, if the company trades towards the high end of that historical range, it would have upside to $300.', 'Waste Management has been a great stock for Gates and other investors over the years. It is a classic example of a growth compounder, and its performance over the past decade has been remarkable.', 'While I would prefer it on a bit of pullback given its valuation, this is a core type of holding. With Waste Management continuing to focus of price and a number of growth projects set to come online in the next few years, expect the company to continue to be a steady performer for years to come. I see over 40% return potential over the next few years.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

For investors, you couldn’t ask for anything more. Basically, these are established growth plays that could benefit from second wind.', 'As with any sustained athletic activity, both the mind and body can get exhausted from the constant pushing. That’s where the truly phenomenal enterprises dig deep to find another gear. These are the innovators to pay attention to, especially as tech stocks enter a paradigm shift of enhanced utility and productivity.', 'Moving forward, only a few companies will be trailblazers for their industries – everyone else may end up playing catchup. With that, here are intriguing tech stocks to add to your watch list.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top tech stocks in the broader communications field, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) commands significant relevancy and leadership in the 5G rollout. Fundamentally, the company is already setting benchmarks for blistering fast data speeds, low latency and the facilitation of new applications. The latter category includes development of autonomous vehicles and smart city solutions.', 'Looking ahead, QCOM should be on your radar for its semiconductor innovation. The company’s ongoing investments in semiconductor research and development drive innovation in areas such as mobile computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. It really could shape the future of how machines communicate with each other.', 'Analysts aren’t missing the boat either, projecting fiscal 2024 revenue to hit $38.14 billion. If so, that would represent a 6.4% increase from last year’s tally of $35.83 billion. In 2025, they believe sales could reach $41.42 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 8.6%.', 'To be fair, although QCOM features a moderate buy rating, the average price target sits at $164.55.

Frankly, plenty of the innovations that we enjoy wouldn’t be possible without the company’s expertise. Because lithography is involved in the development and production of advanced semiconductor devices, it’s a key driver for advancing innovations.', 'Not only that, CNBC notes that it’s the only firm in the world capable of making the complex machines necessary for developing advanced chips. That is what’s known in the industry as job security. Interestingly, though, analysts don’t anticipate much growth this fiscal year, with sales projected to reach $30.35 billion. That’s modestly higher than last year’s print of $30.12 billion.', 'However, in 2025, the company could ring up sales of $37.96 billion, representing 25.1% YOY growth. Admittedly, you’re paying a pretty penny for the growth, with shares trading at nearly 13X trailing-year revenue. Still, ASML is a one of a kind among tech stocks.', 'Analysts peg shares a unanimous strong buy. While the average price target sits at $958.60, the high-side estimate lands at $1,072.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'To be upfront, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) – which is known for its tax preparation and bookkeeping software – isn’t exactly the most exciting idea among tech stocks. However, the Covid-19 crisis may have inadvertently imbued INTU stock with significant relevance. You see, more people are considering life outside the walls of corporate cubicles. Should work from home end, many may decide to venture into entrepreneurship.', 'In other words, we could see an acceleration of the gig economy. Even before the pandemic, the gig economy was a hot topic. Now, it’s even hotter. And because of the more complex tax profiles of independent contractors relative to employees, Intuit should see increased demand for its software. Plus, with AI becoming more integrated into various functionalities, Intuit appears very compelling.', 'For fiscal 2024, analysts project revenue to hit $16.05 billion. That would be an 11.7% gain from last year’s haul of $14.37 billion.

Before the app that hailed rides from independent operators, people had to call a taxi. Now, anyone with extra time can make use of the empty space in their vehicles. It’s absolutely genius. Not only that, Uber can potentially shift the paradigm for another sector.', 'With Uber Freight, the innovative tech firm can potentially revolutionize the broader shipping industry. Per its website, Freight offers flat-rate pricing, fast booking, 24/7 service and perhaps most importantly, live tracking. That helps all parties stay at ease and informed throughout the shipping process. Obviously, there are great risks here but I’m also looking forward to what the company can do.', 'So are analysts, who anticipate 2024 revenue to land at $43.28 billion. That’s up over 16% from last year’s result of $37.28 billion. And in 2025, they believe a top line of $50.4 billion is possible.

Its software supports a wide range of content, including graphics, photography, illustration, animation, multimedia/video, motion pictures and print. Again, as more people consider the gig economy, ADBE should be a long-term winner.', 'What’s really, exciting, though, is Adobe’s incorporation of generative AI in its software offerings. Some of the modulation capabilities that the company facilitates is simply mind blowing. It also helps accelerate productivity, with content creators able to generate quality pieces faster.', 'Analysts have been paying attention to the space, estimating that fiscal 2024 revenue will reach $21.46 billion. If so, that would imply a 20% leap from last year’s print of $17.89 billion. And looking out to 2025, they believe sales of just over $24 billion is possible. That would mean 11.9% YOY growth.', 'Covering experts rate ADBE a consensus moderate buy with a $647.67 average price target. Further, the most optimistic target calls for shares reaching $705.', 'A true stalwart among tech stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an everyday necessity. From searching for top restaurants to eat at tonight to being an easy-to-use cloud computing platform, it’s hard to imagine that there was once life before Alphabet’s Google ecosystem. Moving forward, I anticipate more of the same in this department, which would be simply fantastic.', 'However, as a genuine needle mover, I have high hopes for Alphabet’s AI system. Previously called Bard, Gemini is, in my opinion, a very poor counterpart to ChatGPT. What I really don’t like is Gemini’s tendency to generate false facts – and the audacity to present them as gospel. However, if Alphabet finds a way to integrate Gemini and Google Search holistically (and accurately), watch out!', 'For now, we’re going to have to make do with analysts’ projections for fiscal 2024’s revenue to land at $342.28 billion. That would be 11.3% above last year’s tally of $307.39 billion. And 2025 sales might reach over $378 billion.', 'Analysts see shares as a consensus strong buy with an average target of $164.59.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'You can’t have a discussion of trailblazing tech stocks without mentioning Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Obviously, the company spearheaded what was possible with the internet, catalyzing the e-commerce surge. Now, when we think about online retail, we think about Amazon. Over the years, the company has branched out into several industries, including the grocery space. It’s all about disruption and displacement.', 'Moving forward, I don’t anticipate voodoo magic from the company. Instead, I believe Amazon will steadily drive down costs and implement efficiencies to the point where it may become pointless to go out to shop. Frankly, Amazon shipments are already super convenient and the return process is surprisingly simple.', 'For this fiscal year, analysts on average believe revenue will hit $641.26 billion. That’s up 11.6% from last year’s haul of $574.78 billion. And in 2025, investors may see another 11%-plus move in the top line, resulting in $714.37 billion.', 'Finally, covering experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy (among 41 individual voices).

The company is leveraging its omnichannel capabilities by testing and advancing programs that attract consumers across omnichannel offerings."", 'Further, National Vision is making efforts to rightsize both its store and overall cost structure through the digitization of stores and corporate offices to improve efficiency and productivity. The remote exam initiative is a key leveraging tool for the company amid the changing optometric landscape. Cost and pricing actions are expected to deliver annual savings of $10 million in 2024. Marketing also plays a crucial role in driving traffic to National Vision’s stores, given the infrequent purchase cycle for the overall business.', 'Favorable Solvency: National Vision exited the fourth quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $149.9 million and $10 million in short-term debt payable. Long-term debt decreased to $451 million from $563 million at the end of 2023.', 'Impact of the Legacy Business Termination: Effective Feb 23, 2024, National Vision no longer operates Vision Centers for Walmart. The company will also wind down its remaining AC Lens operations, including its Ohio distribution center, which largely supported the whole distribution and e-commerce contact lens services provided to Walmart and Sam’s Club. Together, this termination and the wind-down will possibly reduce National Vision’s revenues, profitability and cash flows, thus affecting its operational results and financial condition.', 'The transition period, including Walmart’s solicitation period, may also disrupt National Vision’s business operations, reducing sales and productivity and making it difficult to retain staff. This might lead to a significant increase in the costs to retain associates and optometrists during the mentioned period.', 'High Dependence on Vendors: National Vision procures almost all of its merchandise from domestic and international vendors. Moreover, the company has ties with a very limited number of suppliers for the majority of its eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses and contact lenses. Thus, high dependence on a limited number of suppliers exposes it to the concentration of supplier risk.

This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative.

The company will also wind down its remaining AC Lens operations, including its Ohio distribution center, which largely supported the whole distribution and e-commerce contact lens services provided to Walmart and Sam’s Club. Together, this termination and the wind-down will possibly reduce National Vision’s revenues, profitability and cash flows, thus affecting its operational results and financial condition.', 'The transition period, including Walmart’s solicitation period, may also disrupt National Vision’s business operations, reducing sales and productivity and making it difficult to retain staff.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Cincinnati Financial in Focus', ""Headquartered in Fairfield, Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 13.93% so far this year. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.75 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.75% compared to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.46% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.59%."", ""Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.24 is up 8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Cincinnati Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.22%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Cincinnati Financial's current payout ratio is 50%. This means it paid out 50% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Earnings growth looks solid for CINF for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.18 per share, with earnings expected to increase 2.49% from the year ago period.', 'Bottom Line', ""Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout."", 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, CINF is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We have also discussed the declining popularity of college education in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 College Degrees With the Best Starting Salaries.\xa0', 'The cost of college is a major concern for many prospective students and their families. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the average net price of attending a four-year college for first-time undergraduates varies widely depending on the type of institution. In the 2020–21 academic year, this average net price was $14,700 at public institutions, $28,400 at private nonprofit schools, and $24,600 at private, for-profit institutions.', 'Tuition and fees have been steadily increasing over the past decade across public and private nonprofit colleges and universities. The highest increase was observed in private nonprofit institutions, with annual tuition and fees rising by 14% between the 2010–11 and 2021–22 school years.', 'Despite financial aid opportunities, the total cost of attendance remains substantial. For students living on campus, the average total cost of attending a public four-year institution in 2021–22 was $26,000, while attending a private, for-profit school cost $32,900, and a private nonprofit college cost $55,800 annually.', 'Student loans are becoming increasingly common, with 38% of first-time, full-time college students awarded loans in the 2020–21 academic year. However, the average loan amount awarded has decreased slightly over the past decade, and education debt is now the fastest-growing form of debt in the United States, totaling approximately $1.76 trillion.', 'In November 2023, recent college graduates faced a stark reality that despite impressive resumes, including internships and athletic achievements, they struggled to secure employment. The unemployment rate for recent graduates stood at 4.4 percent, higher than the overall unemployment rate and nearly double that of all workers with a college degree.\xa0', ""The pandemic exacerbated the situation, creating a mismatch between available jobs and graduates' preferences. Industries experiencing worker shortages, such as hospitality and childcare, were not appealing to recent grads. Conversely, sectors like tech and finance, where graduates desired employment, faced layoffs and hiring freezes. This disconnect left many feeling disillusioned about their economic prospects post-graduation."", 'The challenges extended beyond securing employment; underemployment rates rose, with many graduates taking jobs that did not require a degree. Economic discontent among young Americans grew, potentially impacting political landscapes. Despite the ongoing recruitment efforts by companies, actual hiring slowed down, particularly in sought-after industries.\xa0', 'Owing to the declining importance of college degrees, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has signed an executive order, eliminating the necessity of a college degree for 75% of state government positions. This decision aims to increase employment opportunities and foster a more inclusive job market in the state. With Minnesota being one of the largest employers, the decision comes at a time when hiring is at a five-year high, necessitating the recruitment of additional employees as per the fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budget. The executive order addresses persistent barriers to job access, acknowledging that many positions require degrees even when not essential for success. To combat this, the order focuses on skills and work experience over formal education and seeks to improve job search clarity and employee development programs.', ""According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2022, individuals with a bachelor's degree earned a median weekly wage of $1,432, whereas those with only a high school diploma earned $853 per week. This signifies a substantial 68% difference in earnings."", 'It is also worth noting that Business Administration is often considered to be one of the easiest degrees that make the most money.

The analyses will help us with the understanding as to why degrees such as these come high salaries, even in the start.', ""Amazon.com,\xa0 Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s incorporation of over 150 PhD economists into its workforce revolutionized its decision-making processes.

For instance, economists shape pricing strategies and leverage advanced algorithms to determine optimal price points. Additionally, their contribution to inventory management has led to impressive improvements which reduced fulfillment costs by 5% in a year for Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Economists also played a key role in Amazon's Prime offering, determining which benefits most attract customers. Such data-backed decisions have largely contributed to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s unparalleled growth, with revenue reaching $386 billion in 2020—a stark increase from $61 billion in 2012, largely attributed to their economist-guided strategies."", ""On the other hand, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) Renewable Energy has enlisted Eastgate Engineering, based in Billingham, Teesside, for the mechanical and electrical pre-assembly work of towers and nacelles at the Dogger Bank Offshore Wind Farm.

We opted to utilize median salaries rather than starting salaries for several reasons. While starting salaries provide a snapshot of initial earnings, they may not accurately represent the overall earning potential of a degree. Starting salaries can be influenced by various factors such as individual negotiation skills, geographic location, and the specific industry or company hiring practices.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Estée Lauder Companies, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.061 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 6.1%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Personal Products industry average of 16%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', ""In the above chart we have measured Estée Lauder Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Estée Lauder Companies  for free."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Estée Lauder Companies doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 27%, but since then they've fallen to 6.1%. However it looks like Estée Lauder Companies might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""To conclude, we've found that Estée Lauder Companies is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", 'On a final note, we found  4 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies (2 are a bit unpleasant)  you should be aware of.', 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Like, really big? That is to say, are you looking to turn a tiny amount of money now into a seven-figure stash later?', 'Never say never. Not only is it possible, it happens more often than you might think. The key is time and picking the right stock, of course, and then remaining patient enough to continue holding that ticker through the rough patches.', ""With that as the backdrop, here's a look at three familiar stocks that turned a $1,000 investment into $1 million, if not more. Just be sure to read through the wrap-up that explains what you can learn from these three enormous winners to repeat the feat in the future."", ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't just a familiar modern-era winner. It's arguably the market's most memorable winner of all time! Shares are up more than 230,000% just since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO) at a split-adjusted price of $0.075. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth around $2.3 million today. That growth has also made Amazon one of the world's biggest companies, as measured by market cap."", ""It's not exactly a secret as to how it happened. Founder and longtime CEO Jeff Bezos saw an opportunity in the internet's infancy, viewing it as a convenience-providing platform where people would eventually do a great deal of their shopping. And he was right. The e-commerce giant alone accounts for over one-third of the United States' total e-commerce sales. That's bigger than the next nine e-commerce platforms combined."", ""It's not just an e-commerce giant anymore, though. It's also a cloud computing powerhouse. Amazon Web Services generated $90.8 billion worth of business last year, turning $24.6 billion of that revenue into operating profit. This arm now makes up roughly two-thirds of the company's entire bottom line. And again, it's a business built from scratch simply because Jeff Bezos saw a budding opportunity and acted."", ""Tech-driven growth isn't the only path to riches, however. Consumer staples can do the job, too. Take Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) as an example. It, too, has made plenty of millionaires out of relatively small investors."", ""OK, there are a couple of important footnotes to add here. One of them is that it's taken Procter & Gamble a lot longer to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million ... several decades longer, to be clear. Second, reaching this seven-figure mark with P&G would have required reinvesting its dividends into more shares of the stock."", 'Slow and steady wins the race, though.', ""Of course, Procter & Gamble also had an unfair competitive advantage. It's owned market-leading brands ranging from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste to Dawn dishwashing liquid for the decades in question. Not only is it easier to maintain a lead you already own, but being a market leader also provides leverage when it comes to keeping competitors in check and distribution partners in tow."", 'Regardless of the reason, P&G has paid off for patient investors.', ""Last but not least, technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has also minted many patient millionaires. The stock's present price of $175 is nearly 175,000% above its split-adjusted IPO price of $0.10 per share. A $1,000 investment in its 1980 IPO would now be worth just under $1.8 million."", ""Granted, Apple's not been a red-hot winner for its entire existence. The company very nearly went bankrupt back in the late 1990s. It required a $150 million cash infusion from Microsoft and the rehiring of Steve Jobs as CEO to turn things around. And even then, things remained a little wobbly for years; the dot-com meltdown of 2000 certainly didn't help matters either. Apple shares didn't make any net progress during this turbulent time."", ""Rather, the bulk of the stock's enormous gain has taken shape since 2007, when the very first iPhone was released. It's not a stretch to suggest this incredibly popular smartphone, in fact, is the crux of the reason for the stock's incredible gains."", ""Whatever the cause, congratulations to the people who understood what a game-changer the iPhone would end up being. It's not just the mobile phone all other phone makers are hoping to compete with. It mainstreamed the very idea of carrying around a web-connected mini-computer in your pocket."", ""The bad news is it's unlikely any of these three stocks can repeat the feat in the same amount of time they first turned $1,000 into $1 million (or more). All three companies are still outstanding. But circumstances were different when each stock began its heroic run-up."", ""The good news is, however, that the reasons Apple, Amazon, and P&G shares performed so well for so long are clear. Lots of other companies behind stocks that haven't yet dished such rallies exhibit these same qualities or soon will if they don't yet. Three of these attributes stand out above the rest."", 'One of these characteristics is a clear competitive advantage. For P&G, it was sheer size, which also ended up being the case for Amazon. For Apple, its edge was a superior product that other manufacturers would often imitate but would never successfully duplicate. Apple also benefited from the fact that it enjoyed complete control of the underlying digital ecosystem -- iOS, the App Store, and more -- that made its devices so functional.', ""Another somewhat related quality of these companies' businesses and core products is that each was and is future-proof. It's an overused example, but it still makes the point perfectly ... it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to circumvent the need for camera film, developing technology and at-home tools that could do the job just as well."", ""Conversely, the companies behind high-performance stocks aren't in jeopardy of becoming obsolete. Consumers will perpetually want newer, more powerful tech and will always want to shop. They'll also need to wash their clothes or brush their teeth. That's why you should be looking for companies that will remain relevant forever."", ""Finally, bear in mind that at least two of these three companies -- Amazon and Apple -- seemed a little out of the ordinary at the time their stocks were getting started on their big gains. We now know they weren't odd, however. These companies were just ahead of their time. The market's next enormous winners will likely look similarly odd. Just look a the bigger picture, considering how consumers and corporations will see their solutions 10 and 20 years into the future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Customer loyalty will also factor in as a supportive factor for some individual airline stocks.', 'UBS analyst Atul Maheswari has been looking into the details of the airline sector, as it continues to recover from the hit it took during the pandemic. He finds several reasons for optimism, and writes, in starting up his coverage of the US airline sector, “The key factor driving our positive bias is potential for cost pressures to moderate and margins to begin moving higher towards the end of 2024 and into 2025… We recommend buying select airline stocks in advance of this upcoming margin improvement later in 2024 and into 2025… We like airline stocks that have: 1) Strong FCF generation & solid or improving B/S, 2) Better near-term relative margin potential; 3) Exposure to business travel; 4) Strong customer loyalty & attractive loyalty program economics.”', 'Maheswari follows this up with several specific airline stock picks, choosing carriers that should see more gains going forward. According to the TipRanks database, these stocks have ‘Buy’ ratings and 20%-plus upside potential; here are the details.', 'Alaska Air Group (ALK)', 'First on our list is Alaska Air. This airline operates primarily on the West Coast of North America, and despite its name, the carrier is based in Seattle-Tacoma, in the State of Washington. While Alaska Air flies mainly along the West Coast, it does offer travel to destinations across the US, in much of Canada, and to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Alaska Air has a strong reputation for quality, but that took a hit recently when one of the airline’s Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft suffered a door blowout during flight.', 'The repercussions of that blowout are still rippling through the industry. Only minor injuries were reported in the accident, but investigations revealed that the aircraft in question had already been tagged for additional maintenance, and large-scale groundings of Boeing aircraft are still impacting the industry as a whole. The 737 is a widely popular passenger liner, and the MAX 9 is one of its most modern iterations – and makes up approximately 20% of Alaska’s fleet, 65 out of 314 total aircraft.', 'In another recent development, Alaska Air announced in December of last year that it had entered into a purchase agreement with Hawaiian Airlines. The deal will see Alaska buy Hawaiian for $1.9 billion, a sum that includes an $18 per share purchase price as well as Alaska’s assumption of $900 million in Hawaiian Air’s debt. The deal was approved by Hawaiian’s stockholders in February, but still requires regulatory approval before proceeding. The US Justice Department has requested additional information from the two airlines before rendering a decision. Pending approval, the airlines expect that the purchase transaction will be completed within 12 to 18 months of the original announcement date.', 'Turning to the financial side, we find that Alaska reported record-level revenues for the full-year 2023, of $10.4 billion at the top line. In the fourth quarter, revenue came to $2.55 billion, skimming above the forecast by $20 million and growing 3% year-over-year. The company’s quarterly bottom line, in non-GAAP measures, came to 30 cents per diluted share, based on net income of $38 million. The non-GAAP EPS was 12 cents per share better than had been expected. While the company burned cash in 4Q23, it saw a net positive operating cash flow for the full year of $1.1 billion.', 'Laying out the UBS view, analyst Maheswari notes that the stock stands to see benefits no matter how the Hawaiian Air deal shakes out, writing, “We believe ALK’s -15% underperformance vs the JETS ETF post HA deal announcement has created a compelling entry point. We think either one of the two outcomes (deal or no deal) will have positives for the stock. The merits of its standalone investment case are strong as our analysis shows the market is pricing in $1.57 bn in EBITDAR for ’25 vs. UBSe standalone ~$1.85 bn. Plus, we see optionality from higher synergies should\xa0the HA deal go through (UBSe proforma ’25 EBITDAR $2.35 bn).”', 'Summing up the situation, the analyst comes down with a bullish outlook: “Alaska is one of the best run US airlines with\xa0close to industry leading margins and a strong balance sheet. We see potential for ALK to benefit from several positive industry drivers over the next 12-18 months including improving revenue per available seat mile (RASM), moderation in cost pressures, and acceleration in biz travel. Plus, its West Coast exposure with hubs in SEA/ SFO/LAX makes it uniquely well placed to participate in an uptick in demand in that region. At these levels, we see a solid 3:1 upside/downside reward.”', 'Maheswari gives ALK shares a Buy rating along with a $54 price target that implies a one-year potential upside for the shares of 39%. (To watch Maheswari’s track record, click here)', 'Zooming out, the stock gets a Strong Buy rating from the Wall Street consensus, based on 11 reviews that include 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are trading for $38.78 and their $48 average target price points toward a gain of ~24% in the next 12 months. (See ALK stock forecast)', 'Delta Airlines (DAL)', 'Next on our list, Delta Airlines, is one of the industry’s largest legacy carriers, as well as a component of the S&P 500 index. The airline keeps its headquarters, and its chief transport hub, in Atlanta, and maintains additional hubs across the US – in NYC, in Boston, in Detroit, in Seattle-Tacoma, and in Los Angeles, to name a few. Delta is consistently ranked among the top-five largest US airlines, whether counting by passengers carried, destinations served, daily flights, or fleet size. On the global scene, Delta flies to major destinations around the world. The company has international hubs in Amsterdam, London, and Paris, as well as Tokyo and Seoul.', 'Delta’s airliner fleet totals nearly 1,000 mainline planes, with a wide variety in types and models. The company operates both narrow- and wide-body aircraft, on both long- and short-range routes. Historically, the company has preferred to fly Boeing aircraft, but since 2008 has been adding significant numbers of Airbus planes to the fleet. For regional flights, the company operates a smaller fleet of jets from Bombardier or Embraer. The variety in the fleet composition poses challenges for maintenance and training, but helps to insulate the company from large-scale regulatory groundings. This is an important factor, as a variety of issues with Boeing, including regulatory matters and manufacturing delays, have caused Delta to delay delivery of ordered 737 MAX 10 aircraft – the most modern version of the 737 – until 2027.', 'The air industry’s rebound from the COVID shutdowns can be seen in the headline number from Delta’s 2023 financial results. The airline reported record full-year revenue of $58 billion, and 2023’s operating income of $5.5 billion was nearly double the 2022 figure.', 'For 4Q23, wrapping up the year, Delta reported $14.2 billion at the top line, up 5.8% y/y and beating the estimates by $420 million. The company saw quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share by non-GAAP measures, 12 cents better than had been anticipated pre-release. The company’s quarterly adj. operating income came to $1.3 billion, and had an operating margin of 9.7%.', 'The company’s anticipated margin profile caught the eye of UBS analyst Maheswari, who uses it as a starting point in his bullish update on the company, writing of Delta, “We are bullish on DAL as we see potential upside to FY’24E & FY’25E margins driven by an inflection in unit revenues and moderation in cost pressures beginning 2H’24. Our FY’24 pretax margin est is 9.9%, up ~30 bps YoY, vs cons of 9.5% while our FY’25 est is 10.9% vs. cons 10.6%. We believe DAL’s revenue per seat mile (RASM) growth will positively surprise the market in 2H’24E as domestic RASM moves higher & Atlantic RASMs remain steady with these tailwinds persisting into ’25 assuming continued supply discipline. This coupled with our expectations for a meaningful moderation in cost pressures in ’25 from better employee productivity, lower maintenance expenses, and slowing pilot wage increase to ~4% from ~7% in ’24 should lead to a more material acceleration in DAL’s margins in ’25E. We recommend buying the stock now in advance of this upcoming multi-quarter period of margin expansion beginning in 2H of this year.”', 'Maheswari puts his stance into perspective by giving DAL an initial rating of Buy, and complementing that with a $59 price target showing his confidence in a 30% upside on the one-year horizon.', 'DAL gets plenty of love from Wall Street, and the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 13 positive analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $45.38 and the $54.33 average price target points toward a 20% upside over the next year. (See DAL stock forecast)', 'American Airlines (AAL)', 'We’ll wrap up this list with American Airlines, another of the giant legacy carriers in the US air travel sector. American, like Delta, is a perennial contender for the top slots among the US airlines, by fleet size, annual revenue, and number of passengers carried. The company is the world’s largest operator of the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody jets, and also has a significant fleet of Boeing 737 models. The company’s widebody planes are all from Boeing, mainly of the 787 family. American Airlines saw its mainline fleet increase by more than 4% year-over-year in 2023, up to 965 aircraft. This is supplemented by 556 regional aircraft.', 'American Airlines, with its regional partner carriers, offers passengers nearly 6,700 daily flights, to some 350 destinations in over 50 countries around the world. The airline’s chief hub and headquarters are in Fort Worth, Texas, one of the nation’s major airports, serving Dallas as well, and the company has additional hubs in LA, Miami, New York, Chicago, Phoenix, and DC.', 'This airline maintains one of the youngest air fleets in the industry, and earlier this month announced a major purchase plan, totaling 260 new aircraft, primarily from Airbus and Embraer. The order includes 85 new A320neo models, and is planned to boost American’s premium seating capacity by up to 20% by 2026. The 90 Embraer E175 models included in the order will be operated by the company’s regional carriers.', 'American finished last year with $53 billion in annual revenue, a record for the company. Quarterly revenue in Q4 came to $13.06 billion, a figure that was down 1% from the prior-year period and was in-line with expectations. Fourth quarter earnings were 29 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, a full 21 cents per share better than the forecasts. The airline had a full-year operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, and recorded its highest full-year free cash flow, at $1.8 billion.', 'In his coverage of American, analyst Maheswari is impressed by the cash flow – and expects it to remain strong. He is bullish on this airline, saying of it, “We expect AAL should see both strong FCF generation and profit acceleration in the next 2-3 years, unlocking higher equity value as net debt moves lower and B/S is delevered. Importantly, we don’t think this is priced in as our analysis suggests the market is pricing in just ~$8 bn in EBITDAR for ’25 (vs. UBSe $8.7 bn) with cons. estimating only ~$3.1 bn in FCF for ’24 and ’25 combined vs. UBSe $4 bn. We see the potential for upwards earnings revision with our ’25 pretax margin est. at 5.9% vs. cons. 5.3%. The stock is trading at ~19% FCF yield on our ’24 ests, which should provide downside support, in our view. Also, a unique near-term catalyst for AAL will be the renegotiation of its 10-year-old co-branded card program, which should drive an acceleration in high margin loyalty income.”', 'All told, these comments support Maheswari’s Buy rating, and his $19 price target points toward a 30.5% share appreciation for the year ahead.', 'While the UBS view is decidedly bullish, Wall Street generally is a bit less so. That said, the stock still claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 14 recent analyst recommendations that break down to 9 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares have a trading price of $14.57 and their $17.56 average target price suggests an upside of 20.5% this year.

Here, we discuss five such stocks — American Eagle Outfitters AEO, Air Lease Corporation AL, Dell Technologies DELL, Universal Health Services UHS and PagSeguro Digital PAGS.', 'While searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales and price/book value (P/B).', ""This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount."", 'However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.', ""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times."", ""A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced."", 'Universal Health Services (UHS) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:', 'A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 11%, the stock of this hospital and health facility operator is certainly well-positioned in this regard.', 'While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UHS meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 16.9% over the past 12 weeks.', 'Moreover, the momentum for UHS is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.23. This indicates that the stock moves 23% higher than the market in either direction.', 'Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UHS has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.', ""In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UHS earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>"", 'Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UHS is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UHS is currently trading at 0.85 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 85 cents for each dollar of sales.', 'So, UHS appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.', ""In addition to UHS, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria."", 'This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.', 'However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'American Water Works in Focus', ""Based in Camden, American Water Works (AWK) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -10.6%. The water utility is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.71 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.4%. This compares to the Utility - Water Supply industry's yield of 2.41% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.59%."", ""Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.83 is up 1.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.28%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. American Water Works's current payout ratio is 58%, meaning it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'AWK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.20 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.12%.', 'Bottom Line', 'Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.', ""For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AWK presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Implemented at sites in India, Mexico, Poland and Thailand, this innovative technology developed by PepsiCo Research & Development teams captures and treats vapor that is released by potatoes when they are cooked for products such as Lay's and converts it to drinkable water that is used to help run manufacturing facilities.

Subway also extended its preexistent contract with Pepsi-subsidiary Frito-Lay, which will provide snacks to the chain through 2030.', '“For nearly twenty years, The Coca-Cola Company has proudly served Subway restaurants in the U.S,” Coca-Cola told Fortune in a statement. “We are committed to serving Subway through the end of this year and will remain focused on delivering value for Subway, their Franchisee Partners, and consumers.”', 'Subway customers will begin to see products like Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke replaced with Mountain Dew, Tropicana, and Gatorade starting in January 2025.', 'The deal is the latest step the snack and drink conglomerate has taken to usurp Coca-Cola as the highest-valued beverage company. Stocking Coke products in all 20,000 of its U.S. stores, Subway was Coca-Cola’s biggest fountain account by number of store locations, per Beverage Digest. Subway has about 37,000 locations worldwide.', 'These supplier switches aren’t unprecedented. On Monday, Cincinnati chain Skyline Chili announced it would switch from Pepsi to Coke products starting next month. Its midwestern neighbor, Wisconsin burger chain Culver’s, made the same switch in January 2023.', 'Subway has hung its hat on consistent positive same-store sales, including a 6.4% increase in global same-store sales in 2023 compared to the year before. It announced Tuesday a franchise agreement with private investment fund McWin that would see it open 600 new stores across Europe.', 'Some of Subway’s good fortune could also rub off on Pepsi, which saw slowed fourth-quarter revenue growth due to repeated price hikes, despite posting profits that exceeded expectations and 5.9% net revenue performance for the year.', 'Meanwhile, Coke posted a $641 million fourth-quarter gross profit, a 7% leap from the same period the year before. Net revenues grew 6% for 2023, according to its earnings report. Even with the loss of Subway, Coca-Cola still has something that Pepsi doesn’t: growing sales volumes. It had 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales, per its earnings.', 'The two beverage giants have traded blows for decades and if Subway’s deal with Pepsi is any indication, the two companies will continue to battle for the top spot in the beverage industry.', 'The soda industry in general has been hurt by high prices, weight loss drugs, and Gen Z’s interest in healthier drink alternatives, yet Coke and Pepsi’s strategies have differed in trying to compete with one another.', 'Coke has been helped by its away-from-home sales—like in movie theaters and restaurants—in the past and has relied on international markets in Mexico and Germany to prop up sagging U.S. demand. The company also uses independent bottlers while Pepsi owns about 75% of its North American bottling operations. Meaning, Coke has to invest fewer resources in packaging beverages. While Coke has mastered the drinks market, Pepsi’s success has been in huge part because of Frito-Lay, which nearly matched Pepsi’s beverage revenue for most of 2023.', 'Both behemoths are taking big swings to attract Gen Z consumers: Coke recently launched a spicy flavor and “Happy Tears,” a salty, sugar-free soda sold in a chrome briefcase only on TikTok Shop. Pepsi’s Doritos-flavored cocktail and promotion of its savory snacks as side dishes for meals similarly appeal to younger audiences.', 'In a hat tip to its beverage market, next week Pepsi will launch its first new product line in six years: Bubly Burst, a lightly sweetened seltzer that piggybacks on the Bubly line originally launched in 2018 to compete with La Croix. It’s part of Pepsi’s growing interest in better-for-you beverages that have surged in popularity among young people. Olipop, an independent company which brands itself as a healthy soda, is targeting $400 million in sales this year, up from $250 million last year.', '“The biggest challenge will probably be just making sure that the product is like something people actually want to buy in bulk,” Nik Sharma, CEO of brand strategy agency Sharma Brands, told Modern Retail.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term."", ""Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of -15% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $12.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -16.2%. The $52.27 billion and $51.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -8.3% and -0.6%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Cisco reported revenues of $12.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.9%.
