We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel."", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Thank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change, matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail. But in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March. We combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points 1 year earlier than our original target of 2024. And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond. Despite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past 2 years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions to shareholders through share repurchases, reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency and boost our returns on invested capital. And while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond. The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets. The most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first 9 months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first 6 months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto. To some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses. Our own PCS data points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity with 74 events. While 2023 did not have a major tropical hurricane make U.S. landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only 7 events and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events. On the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first 9 months of 2023. More structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change, including digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact that the industry also faces technological debt and aging legacy systems. In addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective. We invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually. As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands. We are focused on the 3 key priorities we articulated back at Investor Day, namely delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond. Our first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner. During the year, I met with over 3 dozen client CEOs and senior leaders, representing over half of the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium, to discuss how we could better support their objectives. Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency. On the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low, no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry, having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications. On augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator Solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications. On connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance, contractor, adjuster clients and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business. Finally on connectivity. We were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which traded over $400 million in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market. With expansion across its U.K. specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024. Our strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination. To address this need during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer. Internally, during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024. This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year. Our second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow, Poland and Hyderabad, India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth. Additionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in 2 to 3 years. As we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency. And finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk. We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19% as we continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low, no-code applications and international expansion. We also are investing behind upgrades and replatforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project. As we highlighted before, we are about 1/3 of the way through this project from an investment perspective, and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024. While there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract wins with our largest customers as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a more open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders. We are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility, and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams. We are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our Insurance-related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our 3 recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space, and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, Krug and Rocket, respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle. Before we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming 3 new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events, taking over the reins from Bill Churney, who retired at the end of the year. And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions, replacing Neil Spector, who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All 3 leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process. I want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders. 2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these 3 leaders as we move into 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results."", 'Elizabeth Mann', 'Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold alongside a onetime tax benefit of $30 million or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9%, and claims OCC revenue growth would have been 6.0%. As expected, and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses. That said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7% driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results. Throughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization capitalized on 3 key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included the pricing environment resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active U.S. weather patterns that Lee highlighted. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023. More specifically, during quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our Claim Essentials bundle. That said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024. These strengths were offset, in part, by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%. During the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023. We have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. The fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes. This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth. 2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress while also balancing investments to support future growth. Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the onetime tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier. Adjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million, and diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the onetime tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth, lower net interest expense and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million. It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested energy business. So these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business. On dividends and repurchases. During 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. In addition, our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On guidance, we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target. And they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023. More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth. These opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies, including generative AI. Walking further down the P&L. We expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of $210 million to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million. Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.', 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. (Operator Instructions)With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.', 'Faiza Alwy', ""So I wanted to talk about the revenue guide. Liz, you mentioned a few puts and takes, and we've been talking all of last year about some of the onetime impacts that you noted are normalizing. So maybe give us a bit more perspective, specifically how you're thinking about transaction growth and what some of the puts and takes there are."", 'Elizabeth Mann', '(technical difficulty)takes. But zooming back on the full year, we really think there were 3 drivers of strength in 2023. The first was the pricing environment in the hard insurance market; the second was the transactional rebound and particularly the activity in the auto shopping space; and the third was the elevated weather activity, which, as you heard, 2023 was a record-breaking year for cat events even though there was a single large hurricane driving it. When we think about making assumptions for a future year, we think, in general, that first -- that hard insurance market does persist into 2024. But for the other factors for transactional activity, we would expect that to normalize somewhat. And for the weather, we can never forecast mother nature. So we assume a more normalized level of weather activity.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""It's (inaudible) on for Heather. Just wanted to comment a little bit more on the pricing environment for 2023. You said it was quite elevated. Can you comment on how that is going into 2024?"", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Yes. So thanks. This is Lee. So first, let me distinguish, I think from a pricing standpoint, first, as we indicated in our comments and as Elizabeth just described, the overall premium growth market has continued to be strong as insurers have been able to secure some rate approvals. We think there's more progress in that regard. I want to differentiate that pricing environment, which has been constructive. And from our perspective, that is a partial benefit. It represents approximately 20% to 25% of our revenue base is tied to prior 2-year premium growth. And so that provides some level of support. But I think the more meaningful element of our pricing is our ability to deliver value to our clients. We're doing that probably most significantly in the investment that we're making in our Core Lines Reimagine project, where early renewals from clients that have seen what we are doing, what we are creating, how we are improving their experience, their efficiency has demonstrated that value. And we have been able to realize stronger pricing momentum than we had originally anticipated, which we feel good about as we continue to deliver more functionality through that platform. And I would say further, I think we -- through the go-to-market review that we have done, we have identified some areas to identify how we can capture more value that we are delivering to our clients from pricing structures that align to identifying and identifying that value that we're creating for our clients."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.', 'Andrew Charles Steinerman', ""First, I just want to say how much I appreciate Slide 7, the revenue mix, very helpful. My question is about Verisk auto underwriting revenues, which I think is all nonsubs. Just please verify that. How did this ad market do in the fourth quarter? And what's the assumption for '24 within the guide?"", 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Thanks, Andrew, and thanks for the feedback on the slide. We're always listening to you guys. On the auto underwriting revenues, it is largely transactional but not 100%. There is some subscription revenues in there . And the shopping activity was -- in Q4, it tapered down from Q3, but it is still elevated relative to historical levels. I think for third-party data that the J.D. Power data encapsulates that. I think we are assuming that it will continue tapering down to more historic levels. Even at where it is, we're now lapping the benefit of the strong environment. But maybe for more on that environment, I'll turn it over to Doug Caccese."", 'Doug Caccese', ""Sure. Thanks, Elizabeth, and thanks, Andrew, for the question. Just -- I'll echo what you had said, Elizabeth. As we look at our internal data and also external shopping data, we see a slight slowdown in Q4 from the shopping activity. And when you look at it month over month, you see a slight slowdown from October, November, December. So we are seeing that slowdown happen. We expect that slowdown to continue. But in 2024, we expect still elevated levels of shopping activity. The pivot on this is also that we'll focus on our nonrate action campaigns, which actually allow us to go and help carriers bring in premium immediately that's leaking out of the book while they're waiting for rate to earn in, so it helps in that way."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC.', 'Ashish Sabadra', 'I just wanted to focus on the subscription growth. There were 3 headwinds that were called out. I was just wondering how should we think about the Marketing Solutions, some of the attrition and contracted activity and insurance deck as we go through 2024.', 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. On the marketing side, as we've called out in the year, carriers and being challenged and still trying to achieve profitable growth has not yet turned on their marketing spend. We are starting to see that tide turn, and some of them are returning to profitability. The marketing engines haven't been turned on quite yet, but you're starting to see green shoots in that environment. I would say we're assuming that it will start to return to more normalized levels in the second half of this year."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask on the new product pipeline. Any benefits from that this year? What's kind of -- what's planned for this year? And then also, you talked about some incremental [investments] as well with AI, gen AI. So anything related to that."", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Sure. Thank you, Brendan. And I'm going to repeat the question because you came through a little choppy there. So I think the question was how do we feel about a new product pipeline, areas of investment. And so I would say, we're really excited about a number of the new products and developments that we are -- that we have been working on. In particular, I think, certainly, a lot of the focus has been around generative AI and its application. And we've been exploring its application across a variety of our businesses. I'm going to isolate for a second on our claims business where we have deployed some generative AI applications and are also looking at developing other applications. I'm going to ask my colleague, Maroun Mourad, to talk a little bit about what we're doing in that area as an example of what we have been looking to do more broadly."", 'Maroun S. Mourad', ""Thank you, Lee, and thank you, Manav, for the question. Just building on our 2023 momentum, let me just highlight our strong levels of client engagement and ecosystem partner-driven innovations and co-creation that led to the productization of a couple of solutions. In the casualty bodily injury space, we have deployed a traditional AI methods as well as generative AI technologies in the data extraction and medical file summary space, in conjunction with the deep domain expertise of our legal as well as medical staff in order to continue delivering value to our customers in that space and also in the property estimation space. We have also deployed the gen AI and other AI methods in order to continue delivering automation in the estimation product process. We've talked in the past about XactXpert as a solution to continue driving productivity, speed as well as accuracy, which is very important for our customers to connect adjusters, contractors as well as insurers."", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""And I'd add to that, Brendan. I want to give you a taste of what we're doing on that front. But as many of you know, we've been really thrilled about the success that we've had with our fast businesses application of low and no-code technology to the Life Insurance business. We believe and have begun to engage with clients on how that can be potentially applied to the P&C area. So I think that's a broad opportunity. And then we also as a more insurance-focused entity have been able to try to integrate more of our data sets in our extreme events business and our specialty business solutions area, tying together some of the functions in the excess and specialty market and the reinsurance markets as well as tying together some of our claims data and our underwriting data. And so as we have now fully migrated to the cloud, our ability to facilitate those types of integrations are particularly attractive. So a lot of the great stuff that we have underway that should support future growth for the company."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.', 'Jeffrey P. Meuler', ""I know a lot of factors contribute to the consistent growth, but I just would love your perspective on the procyclicality of bookings or innovation sell-through, especially when it's discrete upsell. And I guess what I'm wondering is as the -- as you start to see the move towards premium adequacy, would you expect to see bookings pick up with that? And maybe can call out a few areas, I'd imagine marketing is one, but any other areas where there may be pent-up demand as the environment gets healthier from a profitability perspective?"", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Sure, Jeff. It's a complex question, and so I think we're trying to get our handle on it. I'm going to kind of isolate on as we see premium adequacy improve and the procyclicality dimension of the business. I should probably start by saying or by saying as I think many of our investors and analysts understand, we don't have a high degree of economic sensitivity. And so there is muted sensitivity to cyclical effects. We tend to be more influenced as you've observed by weather events or activities in the ILS market. And so those tend to have a more pronounced element to it. I do think that there is some procyclicality elements that as the business -- as the insurance industry is doing well and we've seen premium growth that, that does encourage more investment in technology and renovation that accelerates our ability to deploy some of the technologies that we have invested in. And that is a positive tailwind in that scenario. However, I want to isolate that to insurance cyclicality, so that as their profitability grows, and that may be separate and unconnected to just broader economic cyclicality, which is relatively muted. So hopefully that, I think, addresses kind of the core of your question, Jeff."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.', 'Gregory Scott Parrish', ""This is Greg Parrish on for Toni. Why don't you just talk about margin. You talked about what sounded like expansion of some of the ongoing efficiency initiatives that you have. Is the benefit from those within the ongoing 25 to 75 basis points in your framework and balanced by investment? Or do you skew a little bit higher over the next 2 to 3 years as you work through those initiatives? How do we think about that?"", 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. We are continually focused on efficiency here at Verisk and looking at the next levers that we can pull. We do think in the long term that, that being efficient in our core business will enable us to fund some of the investments we've been talking about, all while delivering operating leverage in the business. So beyond 2024 is a long way out, and we'll come back and give impact on that in future years as we get closer. But that's the general concept of delivering efficiency in order to fund some investments and still have an expansion."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.', 'Jeffrey Marc Silber', ""I want to continue on the margin discussion, and I'm sorry if I'm misspeaking here. But I'm looking at your Investor Day slide last March, where you were guiding for 54% to 50% -- 56%, excuse me, adjusted EBITDA margins in 2024, and then another 25 to 75 basis points increase in 2025. Today, you're talking about 54% to 55% in 2024. I'm just wondering what's changed since then? And should we still expect the margin expansion in 2025 that you guided to last year?"", 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, you're right. Our range now as a 1-year guidance and a 1-point range is a tightening from what we have said at Investor Day, which at that time, it was 2 years out and a 2-point range. And I'll remind you that, that Investor Day range, the 54% to 56% itself was a tightening of what had been our 3-year margin target, which was a 3-point range of 53% to 56%. So our trajectory over the past 3 years has been to increase margins by 150 basis points in 2022, another 150 basis points in 2023. And then currently, the midpoint of this guide would represent another 100 basis points on top of that. So we are balancing that margin expansion and the trajectory of margin expansion with investments in growth. The differential between the current midpoint of our guide and the midpoint at Investor Day is entirely encompassed by the 3 incremental investments that I highlighted that were not yet in the cards at the time of Investor Day. Those are the investments in our sales force that Lee discussed, the international expansion with our M&A that has taken place since Investor Day and then the investments in generative AI to drive new products. So I think we're delivering on all of our client-facing investments, those -- the 3 ones being the ones that are particularly new since Investor Day. We're doing that while still delivering 100 basis points of margin expansion. And so we think that balance is an attractive package. If you compound this and this margin expansion on top of what we already delivered in 2023, you come out ahead of those targets that we had in March."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities.', 'Andrew William Jeffrey', ""I'll echo Andrew's comments on Slide 7, super helpful. And my question goes specifically to that graphic. Lee and Elizabeth, when you look at the different solutions here, maybe you could call out a couple about what you're the most excited and perhaps where you think you have the ability to drive faster growth. Whether that's on the claims side or the underwriting side, it sounds like you have some pricing initiatives. Obviously, life and rest of world is pretty exciting, if somewhat small. But are there a couple of areas where you think -- if we look at this chart, say, 3 to 5 years from now, where the contribution of certain solutions have significantly changed?"", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Yes, thank you, Andrew. I'm going to answer your question in a way that I think gives you some insight in terms of where we see value creation opportunity. I think first off, all of our businesses are clearly generating strong organic growth, delivering value to the industry. They're at different scale levels. And so I'll reiterate that for instance, in our forms, rules and loss cost area where we focused our Core Lines Reimagine area. That's a broad area where we are creating value. And I'm going to ask Saurabh Khemka, who leads that effort in that business, to talk a bit about how we're creating value there. It's probably our most scaled opportunity where we can find incremental, incremental value and capture that value. Underneath the businesses as a whole, and this will harken back to Investor Day, we see opportunities to build network value. We've talked about it within the claims ecosystem, where we're adding partners which creates value for our -- all of our market participants, but particularly our Insurance clients. And I'll also note that with our specialty business solutions, while 3% of our total 2023 revenue contribution represents connectivity and a network impact, particularly with the Marsh announcement, that allows us to build value in that network expansion. And I think that holds true in a variety of areas, property estimating solutions in forms, rules and loss costs. But let me give Saurabh an opportunity to talk a little bit about where we are adding value to our clients in a variety of ways with the Core Lines Reimagine project."", 'Saurabh Khemka', 'Sure. Thanks, Lee. So overall, we feel really good about where we are with the Reimagine program and the progress the team has made. And as the program naturally moves towards client deliverables in 2024, our customers will see additional value from benefits of our modernization of our internal systems, which will allow them to have faster access to our analytics, new analytics and insights like our executive industry insights that will be brought into the fine lines of business, will provide benchmark analytics to our customers. And new innovation around our forms management platform, which will make it easier for our customers to manage and track changes to our core programs. And finally, continued migration of our contents to the new platform. We are really encouraged by the client feedback around these innovations, and our customers are excited to see these come to fruition.', 'Lee M. Shavel', ""And I'll cap it off by saying another dimension of incremental growth is the ability to move some of our traditional products into more of a SaaS type of environment. And there, in our extreme events business, the migration to more of a SaaS model, we believe, opens up opportunity to deliver more value to that segment of our clients as well. But thanks for the question."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies.', 'Surinder Singh Thind', ""In terms of just the go-to-market strategy, the investment in the sales force at this point, can you provide a little bit more color in terms of are there like changes in compensation structure or headcount thing that you're looking for? How should we think about that part of the equation?"", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Yes. Thank you, Surinder. So there are a number of elements, and I really have to complement the organization for its receptivity to outside perspectives on what we could be doing better. We looked at it across all of our businesses. And certainly, compensation structure was an area of focus. And there, I think we -- there were 2 things. One, we looked at where market levels were, both from a level and from a composition standpoint so that our sales team felt as though they were being fairly treated, create a good opportunity and aligning our interests with the customer. And we believe that, that will improve our retention and make certain that they are focused on the opportunities that generate the most value for us. We also spent time looking at pricing relative to value, and where we feel as though we're delivering demonstrable value to our clients and how we can be more responsive to structuring our pricing in a way that aligns with our clients' perception of value and what their needs are. So I would just identify those as 2 of the primary functions. I would add somewhat outside of this, we have also been working to make certain that our sales effort is well tied into our senior-level strategic dialogue. So that as we have driven a stronger level of dialogue, we are communicating effectively internally to capitalize on opportunities for sales on existing products that our clients may not be aware of, or we find higher support because of the value proposition at a senior level within the organization. And so that's an area where we expect that we'll be able to do a better job as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair.', 'Andrew Owen Nicholas', 'I wanted to ask about the higher-growth businesses a different way. I think back in the Investor Day, you talked about those potentially representing 20% of your business in 2025. Is there a way to kind of comment on that trajectory and how those faster-growth businesses performed in 2023 specifically?', 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. This is Elizabeth. Yes, I can comment on that. They continue to be on the path and on the trajectory to achieve that goal. So they've achieved strong results in 2023. And the largest change in our growth mix in '23 versus kind of the algorithm laid out at Investor Day has been the overperformance of the core businesses."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic.', 'Russell Quelch', ""Yes. Appreciate you having me on. I also appreciate the strategy you've been making in improving and growing the business. But I want to look at the free cash flow yield. It's still at the low end of the peer group. And Elizabeth did mention in her remarks, I think, a focus on growing free cash flow. So maybe you could expand on this a little bit and how much we should expect free cash flow to grow in 2024 and beyond?"", 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. We'll have to look with you at that stat on free cash flow yield because we think the Insurance business has very strong free cash flow. Again, looking at it maybe as a percent of revenue may understate the strength of it. So we think it's been growing. I mean a demonstration of the growth in the Q4 number, which has grown over the prior year even though the prior year numbers still include the energy business. So we are excited about the free cash flow generation of the business. We don't give guidance on it, but conceptually, it should continue to grow roughly in line with our bottom line. And I think the purest demonstration we can give of that confidence has been the commitment on the dividend increase."", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Yes. And Russell, the one thing I would add is that I think that if you start with free cash flow, given accounting differences over time should even out. And so it should approximate our overall EBITDA growth rate, assuming that the CapEx is growing commensurate with that. I do think in 2024, we're seeing slightly higher CapEx growth because of what we see as a number of opportunities within the business. Part of that relates to the generative AI opportunity. And so we may have periods of higher level of CapEx investment that may bring the overall free cash flow growth down. But over the long term, we see that very -- it should be very commensurate with our overall adjusted EBITDA growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Lee, I've heard a couple of times you talked about pricing opportunities. I think you called out extreme events and property estimating. I'm just trying to maybe get some more details on that. Do you think that will impact 2024? Or is that a longer-term kind of play here? And is this just sort of the first couple of areas where you're finding these new opportunities, and we should expect more of that kind of going forward? Or any way you can help frame this pricing opportunity?"", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""Yes. Seth, thanks for the question. It's difficult to kind of isolate it because it occurs across our business. I would say that certainly -- that those pricing improvements that I've referred to in terms of new contract renewals are factored into our 2024 guidance from an overall revenue growth perspective. So in that regard, we're beginning to see some of that influence that -- our near-term expectations. But I do believe that it is a source of growth for us longer term. And it's not a really very different than what we described as our general operating model, which is that we believe that we can create much broader value for the industry by investing in this data and technology, and capturing that particularly as we add value to our existing clients is largely value-driven pricing. And so that supports the -- that longer-term 6% to 8% growth target that we are working to achieve on a predictable and consistent basis."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is [Sid] on for Greg. I wanted to focus on Slide 18 of your investor deck and when you talk about your capital management philosophy. And just moving forward, curious how we should view repurchases following in your capital management framework versus acquisitions or internal investments, et cetera?', 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Sid. As we highlight there, our capital management philosophy really focuses on our returns on invested capital. We will look to invest in the business. Our CapEx range that we've given you for the year shows the organic investment in the business. On the M&A side, we are active in the market. And we will continue to evaluate opportunities and what we see out there for strong businesses, which bring something additive to the Verisk business. And those 2 things should be generating returns well above our cost of capital. And we assess that and continue to track it. As we highlighted in the script, our incremental returns on invested capital this year were approximately 19%. To the extent we don't find opportunities there, we will continue to return capital to shareholders as you've seen us do pretty consistently in the past."", 'Lee M. Shavel', ""And Greg, one thing that I would add, and I want to thank all of our investors who participated in the year-end investor survey that was conducted. We thought it was very important to get feedback after the first 3 quarters and following Investor Day. And specific to your point and Elizabeth's comments, Greg, one very clear priority from the investors that we surveyed was a preference for internal investment, kind of recognizing our ability to leverage that and generate very high returns. And so we appreciate that input. We share the view that, that's very additive to our business and will clearly be a priority for us."", 'Operator', 'Your final question today comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', ""I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the transaction, revenue trends you're seeing. Adjusting for storm comps, transaction revenue growth was 4% on an organic constant currency basis in 4Q. Directionally in 2024, how do you expect transaction revenue growth to trend from that 4% normalized for storm comps, considering trends like auto rate shopping behavior and the conversion of transaction revenue to subscription revenue. What are some of the puts and takes that gets you higher or lower than 4% transaction revenue growth this year?"", 'Elizabeth Mann', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, George. You're right. The transaction revenue is -- well, first of all, it's coming off a full year of very strong transactional growth, double digit, I think, for the prior 4 quarters. So we are sort of lapping that period. The biggest driver in that elevated strength, a big piece of it was the auto shopping activity that we've talked about before and the weather trends actually being another element of that transactional growth. That was actually offset by some headwinds in our anti-fraud business as they converted transactional customers to subscription customers. So looking forward, I think we expect those trends to normalize. Again, we're not assuming elevated weather activity. The auto shopping trends will begin to normalize."", 'Operator', 'We thank you for participating on the call today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.']"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating the retirement period, you may go to 5 Best Cities to Retire on $10,000 a Month Anywhere in the World.\xa0', 'Everyone wants to live comfortably, and different people use different means to achieve this comfort. While there are a select few that have generational wealth to rely on - Visual Capitalist reports that an estimated 50% of all wealth in America is held by the baby boomer generation - there are others who commit their lives to corporate or venture into the side hustle economy. A report by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) owned LinkedIn reveals that about 50% of Americans are engaged in at least one side hustle.\xa0', 'While the money earned is certainly spent on living life during one’s youth and middle-aged years, it’s also saved up for a secure retirement. The Motley Fool reports that financial planners recommend having 80% of your pre-retirement income to be able to hold the same lifestyle in your retirement years. For a retiree previously earning a $100,000 salary, this would be a sum of $80,000. Similarly, a study by the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans estimate needing a sizeable $1.8 million to retire comfortably, while a Money report states that the average American estimates needing around $5,000 a month for a comfortable retirement.\xa0', 'Even though figures by the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) study, Motley Fool, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and many more may vary, one thing is clear - retirement in America requires a prior investment. However, the reality is very different. Data from the US Census Bureau reveals that 50% of women and 47% of men aged 55 to 66 have $0 in retirement savings, while Smart Asset concludes that only about 10% of senior citizens have $1 million or more in retirement savings', 'The average American is then faced with much tougher times during retirement, where the struggle to make ends meet continues to persist. As a result, Americans then turn to other options, including moving states or even countries and finding cheap and beautiful places to retire in the US or affordable places to retire in the world.\xa0', 'While there’s no doubt that the majority of American retirees face financial strife - or at the very least check-to-check living - during retirement, there are those who don’t. These are the picture-perfect American retirees often painted in the media or publications in idealized versions. They view retirement as the ‘golden period’ of life where stress - cue work and kids - have exited life and what’s left behind is a stretch of peaceful, luxurious living. Most noteworthy are the retirees who not only accumulate millions in their retirement funds but also surpass the widely acknowledged American benchmark of $1.8 million which is highlighted by Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). ', 'What does retirement then look like for the financially secure senior citizen? While pre-retirement focus may have been on investment, Nasdaq says that it now shifts to preserving wealth. This includes living below one’s means, setting financial goals, building an emergency fund, and most importantly, investing - a habit that they would have adopted early on in their life.\xa0', '“Upper middle class retirees often built their wealth by starting to invest at an early age. This includes a diversified portfolio that combines stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investment vehicles. They may have taken advantage of tax-efficient investment strategies, like maximizing contributions to retirement accounts and using tax-advantaged investment vehicles like municipal bonds and tax-deferred investments.”', '-Matt Atwood, Certified Financial Planner, TimeWise Financial', 'With wealth preservation in the works, many retirees achieve their one true goal: a comfortable yet stable retirement income that is often in five digit figures. Not only does this safeguard them from the stresses and panics of financial struggle, but it also allows them to find the best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world.\xa0', 'To know more about the best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world, read below.\xa0', 'To compile this list of the 20 best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Expensive Places to Retire that are Worth It, and U.S. News and World Report, Nasdaq, GOBankingRates, and MarketWatch. Once a list of cities was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across several factors.\xa0', 'These factors included livability scores, health standards, and ease of retirement policies. Livability scores were taken from Mercer’s Quality of Living City Rankings, and healthcare information was taken from Medbelle. Equal weightage was assigned to each factor, and a cumulative score for each city was reached. The cities were then ranked, with the highest-scoring city taking the number one spot on our list of best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world. While financial aspects such as the cost of living, average rent, and median house prices were not considered for rankings, an overall monthly expense for the selected cities was determined to ensure that they were livable on $10,000 a month.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Slowly developing to be a hub for well-off retirees, Lugano offers breathtaking nature views including those of the iconic Swiss Alps.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 26', 'Located on the French Riveria, Saint Tropez is our second European pick for the best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world. Popular for its nightlife and beaches, Saint Tropez offers retirees a slow-paced life, a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of pre-retirement duties. Add its Mediterranean climate to the mix and Saint Tropez proves to be a wonderful find. ', 'Insider Monkey Score: 26.5', 'Number 18 brings us back to home ground with Park City in Utah. This US city offers a well-balanced living experience with a robust healthcare system, a pleasant community, and beautiful landscapes. While one of the more expensive cities, Park City has much to offer to make up for it - plenty of high-end dining options, quality retail, and the much-adored Sundance Film Festival that puts an added glimmer to the area. ', 'Insider Monkey Score: 27', 'Florida is one of the most popular states for retirees looking to move post-retirement, and Miami is one of the most expensive cities in the state.

Dallas enjoys a comfortable 70s ranking for both quality of living and healthcare - 73rd and 74th respectively.\xa0', 'Insider Monkey Score: 30', 'Set on the picturesque Baie des Anges, Nice is the second most-populated city in France. A popular retirement spot, Nice boasts beautiful beaches, stunning architecture, and a pleasant Mediterranean climate. The result is a French city with a high concentration of retirees, all looking for the picture-perfect retirement experience. The healthcare is also commendable with a Medbelle position of 66th.\xa0', 'Insider Monkey Score: 32', 'A coastal city set in Portugal, Lisbon is one of the best places to retire internationally, especially for affluent retirees - Mercer testifies by ranking it as the 39th most livable city in the world. The surge of tourism and influx of retirees has pushed up the cost of living in Lisbon, placing it among one of the more expensive places to retire. However, its offering of high-quality services and leisure activities makes the move well worth it. ', 'Insider Monkey Score: 35', 'Our second Texas pick for the best cities to retire on $10,000 a month anywhere in the world, Houston is quickly growing to become one of the most retiree-prone areas in the US. Its warm weather, tax-friendly policies, and rich culture are all inviting, and retirees from all over the US flock to the city to live out their golden years.

Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by credit and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis.', 'RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused in the Appalachian Basin. The Company is headquartered in\xa0Fort Worth, Texas.\xa0 More information about Range can be found at\xa0www.rangeresources.com.', 'Included within this release are certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect Range’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.\xa0 Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. ', ""All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs, expected asset sales, well productivity, future liquidity and financial resilience, anticipated exports and related financial impact, NGL market supply and demand, future commodity fundamentals and pricing, future capital efficiencies, future shareholder value, emerging plays, capital spending, anticipated drilling and completion activity, acreage prospectivity, expected pipeline utilization and future guidance information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and Range's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made. "", 'The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as ""resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” ""unproved resource potential"" or ""upside"" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC\'s guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range\'s internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer\'s Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range\'s management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range\'s interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range\'s drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. ', 'In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price or drilling cost changes. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. You can also obtain this Form 10-K on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.', 'SOURCE: Range Resources Corporation', 'Range Investor Contact:', 'Laith Sando, Vice

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Unum in Focus', ""Headquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 8.87% so far this year.

Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.22%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 19%, which means it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well.

It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout."", ""Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend.

By embracing the celebrity connection and designing classics with a twist, Hilfiger has managed to keep the company’s momentum going strong for nearly 40 years.', 'Launched in 1985 with Mohan Murjani’s backing, Hilfiger began with menswear, modernizing button-down shirts, chinos and other classics with updated fits and details. The launch was supported by a bold ad campaign — a billboard in Times Square — comparing him to three well-known American menswear designers — Calvin Klein, Perry Ellis and Ralph Lauren. That bold start led to the creation of a brand that grew to about $9.1 billion in global retail sales in 2022, and has constantly surrounded itself with pop culture and what the brand calls “Fame: Fashion, Art, Music, Entertainment.”', 'More from WWD', ""Gucci Designer Sabato De Sarno on Miley Cyrus' Bag, Commercial Pressures and Runway Showmanship"", 'Brand Assembly Offers Intimate, Energetic Trade Show for Contemporary, Wellness and Beauty', 'Coterie Sees Plenty of Action in Après Ski, Denim and Textured Knitwear', '“Our main focus is keeping the brand relevant, keeping it eternally youthful, keeping the momentum and spirit very positive but at the same time putting the consumer first always. That has never changed in the 35 years,” Hilfiger said in a WWD interview in 2020.', 'Hilfiger has always had a knack for reading the fashion-pop culture zeitgeist, with a key focus in recent years on democratizing fashion.', 'From the start, the American designer featured Britney Spears, Usher, Aaliyah and the sons and daughters of well-known people such as Mick Jagger’s children, Rod Stewart’s children and Quincy Jones’ daughter, Kidada. “We were always keeping the brand fresh by looking at new ways to always reinvent and create momentum,” said Hilfiger in that 2020 interview.', ""He started his career customizing bell-bottoms and selling candles, incense and clothing at his own store People’s Place in downtown Elmira, N.Y., his home town. He was initially introduced to Murjani, chairman of the Murjani Group, when Hilfiger had just landed a new job at Calvin Klein. “The day after I accepted the Calvin Klein job, I met Murjani in his office after having been introduced to his family in Hong Kong. He asked what I’m doing these days, and I told him I was going to work for Calvin Klein as the designer of his jeanswear/sport division. And he said, ‘Why do that? Why don’t we start the Tommy Hilfiger brand together?'”"", ""Murjani knew about Hilfiger because he had just won an award from Abraham & Straus, designing his brand, called Click Point. After Murjani suggested they do a line together, Hilfiger said they should call it Tommy Hill since Hilfiger would be too difficult to pronounce. “Mohan said, ‘People can pronounce Yves Saint Laurent, why can’t they pronounce Tommy Hilfiger?'”"", 'Murjani told Hilfiger he could design what he would want to wear. “I wanted it to be preppy but cool, but different than any clothes out there. I wanted it to be oversized and full of really cool detail. In 1985, we launched Tommy Hilfiger classics with a twist. And the brand took off,” recalled Hilfiger in 2020.', 'The Times Square campaign was a breakthrough moment for the brand, which didn’t have a lot of money to spend on advertising. The campaign listed the first letters of the names of the other well-known designers in a “hangman” type game, with the rest of the letters left blank. Hilfiger was the last name on the list and the headline was: “The 4 Great American Designers for Men Are.”', '“When George Lois came up with the hangman campaign, we thought the only way we’re going to become known is through some disruption. Even though I was hesitant to run the hangman campaign, it was disruptive enough to create a lot of attention for the brand,” recalled Hilfiger in that interview.', 'Marvin Traub, the late chief executive officer of Bloomingdale’s, was the first to embrace the brand and opened shops at the retailer. Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York also carried the brand, followed by Macy’s Inc., Nordstrom Inc., and Dillard’s Inc. Hilfiger signed a licensing agreement with The Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. in 1993, and added womenswear, which was first shown during London Fashion Week, in September 1996.', 'In 1986, Hilfiger opened its first stores on Columbus Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, followed by stores in Georgetown, San Francisco, London and Stamford, Conn. The following year the business expanded farther beyond the U.S. to Central and South America and the Caribbean.', 'The entry into women’s apparel wasn’t nearly as smooth and successful as the menswear.', '“It was a struggle at first and then when Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll came as partners [in 1989, Novel Enterprises, owned by Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll, acquired the majority ownership of Tommy Hilfiger Inc., terminating the license agreement with Murjani]…..and Chou became chairman… with Joel Horowitz and me, we decided to put women’s on the back burner, build up men’s, which was our main focus, and Silas said when men’s becomes really strong, then we can do women’s. We did do that.', '“After that, we said we have to do jeans, so we did Tommy Jeans and then we did children’s and then we started with the licensing of underwear, fragrances, watches and other product categories,” recalled Hilfiger in the 2020 interview.', 'In 1993, Hilfiger sponsored Pete Townsend’s tour, and added men’s and boy’s neckwear, belts and small leather goods and boys 8 to 20, followed by men’s suits and sport coats, men’s dress shirts and men’s underwear in 1994.', 'Things were rocking.', 'Hilfiger’s brother, Andy, was instrumental in getting the brand known among musicians and celebrities. He gifted Hilfiger’s clothes to musicians and cool people and then started gifting the hip-hop crowd, who had discovered the brand. Hilfiger started doing big logos and sport-inspired designs with a lot of red, white and blue and featuring sporty, athletic details but with giant logos. “We found that these kids were wearing these clothes on the street, and we really created what’s known today as streetwear,” recalled Hilfiger in the 2020 interview.', ""The designer attributed a lot of the brand’s popularity to Snoop Dogg, who wore Hilfiger’s clothes. “It gave us real credibility in the hip-hop community when Snoop Dogg wore our rugby shirt on ‘Saturday Night Live,'” said Hilfiger."", 'The company went public in 1992, making its debut at $15 a share; it soared to $26 in two months. Distribution expanded to Japan.', 'In 1995, Hilfiger was awarded the Menswear Designer of the Year Award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America.', 'In 1997, Hilfiger opened a major flagship on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, a big image builder that was expected to cater to the entertainment industry. Hilfiger also published his first book, “All American: A Style Book.”', 'In 1998, Hilfiger became the first non-automotive brand to sponsor Ferrari’s Formula One team. The company’s distribution expanded to Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Hong Kong, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey. The company also launched Tommy Hilfiger Home Collection, Hilfiger Denim in Europe, and Hilfiger Athletics Fragrance for men, men’s leather, men’s accessories, outerwear, women’s footwear, socks, and sunglasses, and infants and toddlers.', 'Tommy.com launched in 1999, and Hilfiger sponsored The Rolling Stones’ “No Security” tour, Jewel’s “Spirit” tour, Lenny Kravitz’s tour and VH1 Save the Music’s concert at the White House, while Tommy Jeans sponsored Spears’ “Baby One MoreTime.” Hilfiger also cohosted the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Gala and published his second book, “Rock Style,” focused on rock ‘n’ roll inspiration. That year, a five-story, 16,000 square-foot flagship opened on New Bond Street in London, housing men’s, women’s and children’s lines, licensed products and special collection items. In 2020, The Tommy Hilfiger Corporate Foundation became the first corporate sponsor of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial to be built on the Washington Mall. Also in 2000, Hilfiger closed two unprofitable flagships, the unit on New Bond Street in London and North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.', 'In 2001, Hilfiger bought the license for Tommy Hilfiger Europe from TH International NV for $200 million cash. Tommy Hilfiger Corporate opened its first flagship in New York City, Tommy Hilfiger SoHo.', 'But by the late ’90s the Hilfiger brand had hit a wall and the next few years were extremely challenging.', '“What happened in the ’90s was that the whole brand was over-distributed. It wasn’t just about the hip-hop streetwear. It was about everything Tommy Hilfiger was over-distributed. You saw it on every single street corner, you saw it on every single person. We had stores all over. We were selling every department store, and we had to do a cleanup. We had to take a step backward to go forward. We were always adjusting the business to cater to the needs and the demands,” said Hilfiger in a WWD interview.', 'Part of the problem was that as a publicly traded company, it needed to please Wall Street and show growth. In April 2000, the $1.6-billion-a-year company said that profits for 2001 would fall by between 30 percent and 40 percent, and that revenues would drop 5 percent. The news sank the stock.', 'In the meantime, the European business was growing steadily and was positioned at a higher level. Fred Gehring, then-CEO of Hilfiger Europe, and his team positioned the European business with more sophisticated product. It was higher-priced, higher-quality and they opened stores shoulder-to-shoulder with leading luxury brands.', 'In 2003, Hilfiger stepped down as chairman of the company, assuming the title of honorary chairman and principal designer. Then-CEO Joel Horowitz took over as chairman, and co-chairmen Chou and Stroll left the company. In August 2003, Horowitz stepped down as president and CEO and was succeeded by David Dyer as president and CEO. Horowitz remained executive chairman through March 31, 2005.', 'In 2004, for the H campaign, David Bowie and Iman were shot together. That same year, product launches included True Star women’s fragrance with Beyoncé, women’s underwear, ski and eyewear. In 2005, Enrique Iglesias was featured in the True Star for Men fragrance campaign. The company celebrated its 20th anniversary during New York Fashion Week with a show that included celebrities, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Sean Combs and a performance by the Black Eyed Peas.', 'The next step was taking Hilfiger private with Apax in May 2006 for $1.6 billion. The company decided to take a step back to move forward, and cleaned up the distribution and took a page out of Gehring’s book and started growing again.', 'In 2007, Hilfiger acquired Tommy Hilfiger Europe, Tommy Hilfiger Japan Corp. and the Tommy Hilfiger global sourcing operations. Gehring became CEO of the entire brand, based in Amsterdam.', 'For the North American business, they signed an exclusive deal with Macy’s, which ran from 2007 to 2009. They also started distributing a lot of the European product in the U.S. through its own stores and department stores. In 2009, Hilfiger opened the Tommy Hilfiger Fifth Avenue global flagship, its largest retail store worldwide, and the brand launched hilfigerdenim.com. In 2010, Hilfiger opened a new flagship on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, and roughly the same year, it revealed it was opening a new flagship in Tokyo, scheduled to open in March 2012.', 'The brand’s fortunes started to turn around in the U.S., and the company was sold to PVH Corp. in 2010 in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $3 billion. In 2009, in fact, Hilfiger generated $4.7 billion in global revenues, which grew 8 percent in all regions, channels and collections.', 'In 2012, Hilfiger received the CFDA’s Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the fashion industry’s highest honors. In 2013, a Hilfiger flagship opened in Los Angeles’ West Hollywood. That same year, Daniel Grieder became CEO of Tommy Hilfiger Corp. Gehring became chairman of Tommy Hilfiger and vice chairman of PVH. In 2014, PVH Corp. shut down the Tommy lines, which was described in the PVH annual report as “an unprofitable and brand inconsistent youth-oriented business.”', 'PVH has continued to oversee a focused approach to growing the brand’s worldwide relevance, presence and long-term growth.', 'Throughout the brand’s history, the celebrity connection has always been strong. In addition to sponsoring concerts and naming musicians as faces, the brand has in the past tied up with tennis champion Rafael Nadal, who had worked as a Hilfiger brand ambassador for several years and was re-signed as a higher profile spokesman. He promoted Hilfiger underwear, tailored and the Bold fragrance. Other collaborations were with America’s Cup, Formula One, Looney Tunes, Zooey Deschanel, Coca-Cola, Keith Haring, Sheryl Crow, The Chainsmokers, DJ Khaled and most recently, Sofia Richie Grainge, among others.', '“Using celebrities in our advertising, we were able to attract their communities and their fans. So it grew our fan base,” said Hilfiger in a 2022 interview. ', 'In 2016, Hilfiger named Gigi Hadid brand ambassador for the global women’s business. She became the face of the campaign when it entered its highly successful “see now, buy now” chapter, and she codesigned a capsule collection for the company. Following the codesigned line with Hadid, Hilfiger went on to do codesigned collections with Lewis Hamilton and Zendaya.', 'The “Tommy Now” fashion shows featured elaborate themes and sets such as the “Tommy Pier” at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, a ’70s-inspired show codesigned by Zendaya in Paris, and a “Tommy Factory” at Brooklyn’s Skyline Drive-in to launch a collaboration with the Andy Warhol Foundation. “Tommy Now” shows were staged in New York City, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Shanghai and Paris. Looks were available immediately across dozens of countries online at tommy.com, in Tommy Hilfiger stores, and at select wholesale partners and on social media.', 'The “Tommy Now” shows drove strong momentum behind the brand’s womenswear, in terms of engagement with new audiences, increases in social media and press visibility and impressive sales growth. The halo effect across the brand positively impacted all divisions globally. In 2017, Hilfiger relaunched Tommy Jeans, and Hifiger partnered with Vetements on a capsule collection.', 'The brand has continued to innovate with initiatives such as 3D designs, a digital showroom, artificial intelligence, gaming, a virtual Tommy Play store on Roblox, sustainability, adaptive clothing and diversity initiatives. Hilfiger has launched numerous initiatives around “waste nothing and welcome all.” It introduced The People’s Place Program in 2020, which aims to advance the representation of Black, Indigenous and people of color within the fashion and creative industries.', 'Daniel Grieder stepped down as CEO of Hilfiger Global and PVH Europe after 23 years with the group in June 2020, and was succeeded by Martijn Hagman.\xa0Avery Baker, president and chief brand officer, resigned in July 2023. She had been in the role since November 2020, and was with the company for 24 years. Gary Sheinbaum, who had been CEO, Tommy Hilfiger Americas, departed Hilfiger in 2020.', 'In 2020, the company introduced the “Moving Forward Together” campaign, as well as the “Make it Possible” campaign.', 'In 2022, Hilfiger was awarded WWD’s John B. Fairchild Honor, recognizing a career of influence and distinction in the fashion industry.\xa0The honor is named after WWD’s legendary, revolutionary and feared publisher, the late John B. Fairchild. That same year, Hilfiger presented his spring 2022 collection at Decentraland’s Metaverse, a blockchain platform that allows for NFT integration. The brand also returned to NYFW for its first show since before the pandemic with a fall Richard Quinn collaboration. The live show was supplemented by a virtual experience on Roblox.', 'In November 2022, PVH Corp. said it would unwind its licensing arrangements with G-III Apparel Group for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein women’s wholesale apparel in the U.S. by 2027. PVH plans to start manufacturing those two lines themselves.', '“We’re going back to the DNA of Calvin and Tommy that made each of these brands collide with culture in a positive way and become iconic globally. We’re making that DNA current through product and marketing and the brand experience today. Our long-term vision is to build Calvin and Tommy into the most successful lifestyle brands in the world and then make PVH one of the highest performing brands groups in our sector,” said Stefan Larsson, CEO of PVH, in March, 2023.', 'In 2023, Sophia Hwang-Judiesch joined as president, Tommy Hilfiger North America.', 'In February 2024, Hilfiger returned to a regular wholesale model and showed its fall 2024 collection at the Oyster Bar in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, staging a big finale with Jon Batiste. The new collection was repositioned in a more luxury context.', '“The idea is we are elevating. We are doing everything from tailoring to casual and in between, but definitely more sophisticated. The shapes are more modern. The fabrics are sourced in Italy. The DNA is still attached to the brand but it’s done in a very new way,” said Hilfiger before the show.

The Aaron’s Business segment has been witnessing lesser lease portfolio size and lease renewal rate, coupled with fewer exercises of early purchase options and weak retail sales.The company has been impacted by changing market dynamics. Sluggish demand for discretionary products due to the impacts of lower income on customers has been mainly hurting retail sales trends, which is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the challenging demand trends to persist in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in 2024.

Aaron’s express delivery program bodes well. Gains from the e-commerce initiatives are expected to have cushioned the company’s top line in the fourth quarter.Alongside these initiatives, the company has been focused on cost-reduction measures aimed at improving efficiency and strategic procurement.

According to Reuters, the company revealed that a slump in demand from the biotech sector for its services could extend into 2024. Not surprisingly, the market didn’t appreciate the announcement and sent TMO tumbling downward.', 'However, the red ink was short-lived. Since that announcement to the end of last year, TMO stock gained 22.5% of market value. Stated differently, betting on contrarian biotech stocks can be risky due to their unpredictable nature. Circumstances could be going along smoothly and then wham! A poor clinical result could send shares into the abyss.', 'On the other hand, the sector remains permanently viable for attempting to uplift the human condition. According to Grand View Research, the global biotech market reached a valuation of 1.55 trillion last year. And the industry could print revenue of $3.88 trillion by 2030.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So, if you’re patient enough, you can potentially win big in the medical innovation space.

Per the company’s website, it’s been committed to changing the course of cancer treatment for more than 40 years.', 'Currently, the market doesn’t seem to appreciate the narrative, with AMGN stock looking unstable since the beginning of February. Still, that also means that shares trade at just under 16X trailing-year earnings (without non-recurring items). That’s notably better than the sector’s median print of 22X.', 'Over the long run, the global oncology market could clock in at $470.61 billion by 2032. That represents an 8.8% compound annual growth rate from 2023. In the prior year, the sector reached a valuation of $203.42 billion.', 'Analysts largely see good things ahead, rating shares a consensus moderate buy with an average price target of $311.90. Further, the high-side target lands at $380, providing significant room for optimists of contrarian biotech stocks.', 'Source: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com', 'A Swiss multinational pharmaceutical corporation, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) represents one of the biggest players in the broader healthcare ecosystem. As for its relevance to contrarian biotech stocks, it commands a massive presence in the field of gene therapy. In particular, Novartis focuses on developing innovative treatments for genetic disorders and rare diseases. However, shares haven’t looked well since late January.', 'While it’s daunting at times to engage equities when they’re down, NVS now trades at an attractive earnings multiple of under 14X. In contrast, this metric sits favorably lower than 72.35% of sector rivals.

Moreover, the company’s researchers have developed 11 commercially available HIV medications. In addition, it’s advancing a robust pipeline of next-generation therapeutic options.', 'While significant innovations have helped the healthcare ecosystem manage the disease, approximately 1.2 million people in the U.S. have HIV.

Also, AZN stock suffered negatively tilted choppiness throughout 2023.', 'Still, if we’re talking about contrarian biotech stocks, it’s difficult to ignore AstraZeneca. With the red ink, AZN now trades at a forward yield of 14.41X. To be fair, that’s only a bit better than average. However, the print was much higher in the early years of the pandemic.', 'Moving forward, AstraZeneca could bounce back through its respiratory disease therapeutic unit. For instance, the global lung disease therapeutics market reached a valuation of $83.4 billion last year.

Mainly, this directive aligns with the prescription market though it also develops over-the-counter medications.

Since January, SNY hasn’t gotten off to the best start. And the trailing 52-week performance is rather disappointing. At the same time, the crimson stains also facilitate an attractive valuation. Presently, shares trade at only 10.71X forward earnings, better than 69% of the company’s peers.', 'Looking ahead, Sanofi could benefit hugely (albeit cynically) from diabetes care.

Conspicuously, Biogen’s revenue from MS products came out to $1.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year. As if the company needed any more bad news, management also disclosed demand erosion due to competition from generic drugs.', 'Further, the leadership team stated that dropping Aduhelm represented a difficult decision. However, it may have been the best decision in the short term. Looking ahead, new product launches may help bring Biogen’s revenue back to a northward direction.', 'There’s no denying that BIIB stock is printing some ugly performance stats.

The hawkish inflation figures saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) recording its worst day since March 2023 and the Russell 2000 shedding 4%. That happened as U.S. bond yields climbed to 4.32% and major technology stocks took a hit.The CPI reaction reveals just how sensitive stock prices can be to inflation, with higher prices diminishing consumers’ spending power, lowering demand and adversely hurting most companies. With inflation on the rise, it is more likely the Fed will keep interest rates high for an extended period, posing challenges to stock valuations in the context of increased borrowing costs. Therefore, when buying inflation-proof stocks, one must examine factors related to demand-side economics and monetary policies.Specifically, some businesses can benefit in a high-inflation environment, such as discount grocery stores that attract customers looking for bargains.

Beat Earnings Expectations And Analysts Now Have New Forecasts,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-walmart-inc-beat-earnings-112256265.html,1708600976,STORY,['WMT'],"[""It's been a good week for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest full-year results, and the shares gained 3.0% to US$174. Walmart reported US$648b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 beat expectations, being 5.6% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Walmart ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Walmart's 30 analysts is for revenues of US$668.1b in 2025. This would reflect a modest 3.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 21% to US$6.99. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$663.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.03 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""With the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 6.3% to US$192. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Walmart analyst has a price target of US$228 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$147. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Walmart's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 3.1% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 4.7% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.4% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Walmart."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Walmart's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Walmart going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Walmart that we have uncovered.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Lore, the CEO and a master fundraiser, has helped Wonder raise nearly $1 billion in funding since its 2018 founding. Wonder has raised $200 million of those funds from Lore himself, in both equity and debt, multiple sources told Fortune. And his financial backing of the company will increase in a new funding round expected to total as much as $500 million, these people said.', ""The match between Walmart and Wonder, which originally launched with a focus on delivering what it called “fast fine” meals to customer homes, might not seem natural. But Wonder is trying to prove Wonder's food-hall-style model is “adaptable,” according to Daniel Shlossman, a former Sweetgreen executive who joined Wonder last year as growth and marketing chief. And the close history between Walmart and Lore, who also is the co-owner of the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves franchise, certainly helped."", 'The first Wonder pilot test with Walmart is a 750-square-foot storefront inside a supercenter in Quakertown, Penn., that offers eight cuisines with a fast-casual bent (compared to a Wonder New York City location that might offer two dozen “restaurants”) out of the one Wonder space. One is Tejas Barbecue, serving brisket and pulled pork sandwiches in partnership with the beloved Texas-based restaurant of the same name. But meals from other options like Limesalt are developed by Wonder’s own chefs.', 'With the Quakertown opening inside Walmart, Wonder is expanding beyond its existing network of 10 storefronts. Two more Wonders are scheduled to open in Walmart stores in New Jersey in May—one in Teterboro, across from an airport for private jets that Walmart management uses when visiting the NYC metro area, and another in Ledgewood, about 40 miles west of Teterboro. The two companies are currently discussing a potential fourth location for a pilot test, according to Shlossman. In total, Wonder plans to open 25 new locations in the tristate area this year, Shlossman told Fortune.', 'Wonder acquires the rights to use a renowned chef’s likeness and recipes, typically through cash payments and equity in the startup. The model initially focused on delivery, with meals finished in vans outside of customer doors. But a little over a year ago, the company ditched that model and laid off hundreds of employees in a massive pivot. While the company still says it is delivery-first, it no longer utilizes the delivery van model; customers can select pickup or delivery out of their closest Wonder storefront or eat on-site in small seating areas.', 'In the first five days of operation inside the Quakertown store, the ratio heavily skewed toward on-site dining versus takeout or delivery.', '“We think the product-market fit works everywhere,” Shlossman said.', 'Do you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Commercial gaming revenue for the year reached a record $66.5 billion, surpassing the prior record set in 2022 by 10%.

Great to have you here with us on this topic. Let's start right there, after a year that we did see, with the amount of wagers that were handled for casinos, how can they make sure that investors reap the benefits as well?"", ""JOHN DECREE: Yeah, I think that's the million dollar question in the boardroom, with the results that we've seen this past year, and the trajectory of wagers, and earnings of all these casino companies, we're generally surprised at how the stocks have performed. I think people have been anticipating a recession for the past 18 months, and it hasn't really come yet. So, you know, we've seen companies starting to buy back stock in droves, MGM and Boyd Gaming are two that have been buying back a lot of stock and have seen strong share price performance on a relative basis."", ""But the year ahead. I think, companies just need to execute. The demand is there, they're managing some wage inflation, cost inflation. But these are free cash flow stories, they're value equities largely across the board in a market that's looking for growth. So I think casino companies will have to look for growth on top of what's been a record year, and, in the interim, maintaining discipline and use that free cash flow, and buying back stock seems to be one of the preferred methods for companies to create some value right now."", 'SEANA SMITH: John, you mentioned one of the headwinds facing the industry, is wage inflation, cost inflation right now. In terms of what that means, or how you see that impacting, we know how it has impacted the bottom line over the last couple of quarters. But what that means here, looking out for the rest of 2024, how big of a challenge is that for the industry at large?', ""JOHN DECREE: Yeah, it feels like probably the largest annual increase in operating expenses for casino companies that we've seen in a long time. Wages is certainly a big piece of that. And after a couple record years of profits, things are catching up, like employee wages. There's pretty significant renegotiated union contracts that came this year, particularly in Las Vegas."", ""And so it is a headwind, I think we're looking at mid-single digit op-ex growth for casino companies broadly this year. And maintaining mid-single digit revenue growth of the high base that you've mentioned Brad, is going to be pretty challenging. So I think they'll continue to find ways to mitigate costs in other places and keep driving revenue, so they'll have to find new ways."", ""They do have digital forms of gaming now. Sports betting has been a big boom for the industry, gaming as well. And that's a key area of growth that a lot of casino companies are participating in, like Caesars and MGM. And that's a growth source that'll help offset some of the stagnation they might have in core earnings from all of that operating expense growth.""]"

If you want to skip detailed analysis of Estate Planning sector, you can go directly to 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.', 'Estate planning has been a practice since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. Then, documents were used to ensure proper inheritance, typically favouring male heirs. The process involved witnesses, signatures, and the creator being of sound mind. Throughout history, various societies have had their own versions of inheritance laws, including references in ancient religious texts.', 'However, in more recent history, the right to estate planning was reserved for a privileged elite, denying access to minority groups like Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Even after legal changes, many communities still lack easy access to education about estate planning. It is essential for underserved populations to have equal opportunities for creating estate plans to protect themselves and their families. Contrary to common belief, estate planning is not just for the wealthy and well-defined group of society but is important for everyone.', 'As of 2024, only 32% of Americans has a will, marking a 6% decline compared to 2023, the first drop in estate planning rates since 2020. The survey by Caring.com revealed that 40% of individuals without a will cited insufficient assets as the reason. Notably, lower-income Americans were twice as likely to mention this, reflecting the disproportionate impact of the economic situation on their decision-making regarding estate planning.', 'Income inequality has played a significant role in estate planning trends, with lower-income households experiencing more vulnerability to inflation and economic challenges. The decrease in estate planning rates is evident across different demographic groups, but young adults aged 18-34 are the only age group that has not experienced a decline since 2020. It is crucial to emphasize that estate planning is essential for everyone, not just the wealthy. Despite 64% of Americans acknowledging the importance of having a will, only 32% have one. This underscores the need for increased awareness and access to estate planning resources for all individuals, regardless of their financial circumstances.', ""The Trusts and Estates sector deals with managing trusts, estates, and agency accounts according to fiduciary agreements for beneficiaries. Revenue in this industry has seen a steady increase over the past five years, mainly driven by gains from assets held in trusts and regular dividends. The industry has benefited from strong performances in equity markets and housing price appreciation during this period. From 2018 to 2023, the industry's revenue has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8%, reaching $221.4 billion, with a projected 4.2% increase in 2023, as per IBIS World. However, we can't guarantee the accuracy of these figures."", 'In the world of estate planning, along with financial and investment planning, it’s essential to look up various big players in the industry, namely, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Teaching children how to run the business early on can prepare them for potential future responsibilities."", 'An annuity is a valuable asset to leave for children, offering stable income and potential tax advantages, particularly with non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax funds. By annuitizing the annuity, children can convert it into a reliable income source to cover living expenses for a specified period or lifetime. An annuity helps manage the risk of outliving savings or market downturns. While it provides a stream of income, annuities may have limitations in flexibility and liquidity.', 'Real estate assets, acquired through hard work, can be a valuable inheritance for children, offering financial security and potential growth over time. In addition to safeguarding retirement funds, real estate properties with shared memories can create sentimental value for the heirs. Real estate is a safe investment with potential for growth and can provide financial security for children. However, it may come with maintenance costs and management responsibilities for beneficiaries.', 'A brokerage account, containing stocks and bonds, offers a valuable non-cash financial inheritance that can grow in value over time. These accounts allow for active trading before being transferred to children, who can benefit from the rising asset value gradually. One advantage of brokerage accounts is their divisibility, making it simple to distribute the assets among multiple children. Moreover, stocks are easily liquidated, providing access to cash when needed through the brokerage account.', 'Placing a house into a trust offers several benefits, including asset protection against potential risks like creditors, avoidance of probate for a quicker transfer to beneficiaries, potential tax advantages, and the ability for the settlor to maintain control over asset management. However, there are drawbacks to consider, such as the associated costs of establishing and maintaining a trust, the loss of control once the house is in the trust, the complexity of trust management, and limited flexibility with irrevocable trusts.', ""A spendthrift trust is a type of trust that restricts a beneficiary's access to trust assets based on conditions established by the grantor. This trust structure helps prevent beneficiaries from mismanaging their inheritance and safeguards trust assets from creditors. By disbursing funds incrementally rather than as a lump sum, a spendthrift trust can be beneficial if the beneficiary lacks financial maturity, tends to make impulsive decisions, is in significant debt, vulnerable to deceit, struggling with addiction, has special needs and receives government benefits, facing or anticipating divorce, or works in a litigious industry where asset protection is crucial. The pros of a spendthrift trust include protection from creditors targeting trust assets and a controlled distribution of funds over time."", 'UTMA/UGMA accounts, or Uniform Transfers to Minors/Uniform Gift to Minors accounts are placed 6th on our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.

However, the funds in the account are taxable to the child, and some investments may trigger tax consequences, potentially subjecting the child to higher tax rates.

Flowserve's fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to a very solid year of improved execution and consistent progress. Our financial and operating performance throughout 2023, supported raising our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance 3 different times as we significantly exceeded our original expectations. For the full year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 20%, driven by enhanced backlog conversion and operational improvement while delivering higher adjusted gross and operating margins. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share increased by over 90%, and our operating cash flow improved by over $360 million compared to 2022.Bookings exceeded $4.25 billion for just the second time since 2016, which supported our strong year-end backlog of $2.7 billion. Most importantly, Flowserve entered 2024 well positioned to drive continued momentum and success, and we are well on our way towards achieving our 2027 financial targets that were communicated last September. I want to sincerely thank all of our associates around the world for their efforts and dedication throughout the year. Our commitment to serving our customers and their passion for our business are critical to driving exceptional financial results. I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, including our adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, which brought our full year adjusted EPS to $2.10. We are seeing the impact of our improved operating model higher backlog conversion and significantly better financial performance. These improvements drove fourth quarter sales of nearly $1.2 billion and expanded our sequential adjusted operating margins to 10.5%. We also delivered $195 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, which was driven primarily by our earnings and strong working capital performance. This was a clear highlight for us as we are beginning to deliver improvements in our inventory management as our supply chain continues to normalize and lead times shorten. Our markets remain supportive as we delivered over $1 billion in bookings for the eighth consecutive quarter. While our full year 2023 book-to-bill was just below 1.0x, our backlog remains at a very healthy $2.7 billion as we entered 2024. Let me now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter bookings. General market activity remains high, and we generated bookings of $1.04 billion in the quarter. We achieved this level due to the success of our 3D growth strategy, coupled with continued high levels of aftermarket and MRO activity that we captured around the world despite the lack of a major project award. We did obtain a significant number of smaller awards in the $5 million to $10 million range, which together totaled roughly $100 million across all industries and regions.Our largest project award was only $9 million in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined on our project pricing approach and margin expectations. While this strategy may result in some lost incremental awards, we are confident that we will ultimately create more value with this selective bidding approach. Our 3D bookings represented roughly 30% of our total awards during the quarter, where we saw particular strength with LNG, nuclear and water awards. While some of the larger projects we previously expected to be awarded during the fourth quarter were delayed, they remain viable and healthy opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. For full year 2023, our bookings were nearly $4.3 billion. Turning to our aftermarket business. Most of our customers' facilities continue to operate with high utilization rates. While their focus remains on reliability, efficiency and emissions reductions, we are positioned well to capture the aftermarket and MRO business associated with this type of work. For the ninth consecutive quarter, we generated over $500 million in aftermarket bookings. For the full year, our aftermarket bookings were nearly $2.3 billion, which were up 5% year-over-year. More importantly, we see the elevated demand for our higher-margin quicker turn aftermarket offerings continuing into 2024. Our overall market outlook for 2024 is very encouraging given the project opportunities and aftermarket trends we are seeing today. We believe the themes of energy security and decarbonization will continue to drive global spending for years to come. At year-end, our total project funnel has increased 13% versus prior year enabling us to remain disciplined and selective in the new project work we pursue. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by mid and downstream activity in the Middle East, where we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant investment in the region.Furthermore, our energy transition project funnel also increased nearly 25% year-over-year driven by decarbonization activities in the pursuit of clean energy. We believe we can secure enhanced project bookings in 2024, given the visibility that we have in our forward funnel. Beyond projects, we anticipate our aftermarket and MRO business to remain at elevated levels and support our growth into 2024 and beyond. We continue to see healthy activity levels despite some of the softening consumer trends and economic uncertainty that are highly publicized. Additionally, we are seeing signs of stability in areas that were depressed in 2023 like European chemicals. Our global install base is incredibly large and we have further opportunity to improve our aftermarket capture rates as we go forward. Overall, we believe that our global network of quick response centers combined with our commitment to serve our customers with speed and high levels of service will allow us to grow our aftermarket franchise further in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Amy to address our fourth quarter and full year financial results in greater detail."", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let me also start by saying how pleased I am with our fourth quarter results, which demonstrated continued operational momentum, disciplined cost management and strong cash generation. For the fourth quarter, we achieved our best quarterly sales level since 2015, and adjusted operating margin of 10.5%, our highest quarter of the year and $0.68 of adjusted earnings per share.Our operating cash flow was also strong at $195 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $125 million. These results continued our recent trend of sequential quarterly improvement across many areas, which led to our outstanding full year 2023 results. Starting with other details in the quarter. Our reported earnings per share were $0.47, which included $0.21 of net adjusted expenses, primarily below-the-line FX impacts and realignment charges. Improved operating performance drove a 12% increase in revenues over prior year, comprised of FPDs and FCD's growth of 13% and 11%, respectively. We also generated strong top line growth in both original equipment and aftermarket, with revenue increases of 15% and 9%, respectively. Many of our regions contributed to the double-digit sales growth as well, with notable year-over-year improvement in the Middle East and Africa, North America and Europe, of 27%, 14% and 13%, respectively. Shifting to margins. We generated adjusted gross margins of 29.8% during the quarter, a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior year's fourth quarter despite higher performance-based compensation expense and the modest mix shift to original equipment. The margin improvement was driven by increased sales leverage, benefits from our new operating model and continued traction with operational excellence initiatives and an improving supply chain environment.At a segment level, we are particularly pleased to see FCD realize its highest quarterly adjusted gross margins since 2019. At 32.2%, representing a 310 basis point year-over-year improvement. On a reported basis, fourth quarter consolidated gross margins increased 70 basis points to 29.1%. Despite the net increase in realignment and asset write-downs of $4.1 million, versus prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased $39 million to $230 million compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to $13 million in higher year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation and an increase in bad debt of $6 million as well as some benefits in 2022 that did not recur this year, such as the $9 million legal settlement and a small gain on an asset sale of $4 million.Despite these somewhat discrete items, adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales was 19.7%, driven by solid operating leverage during the quarter. On a reported basis, Fourth quarter SG&A increased year-over-year by $41 million to $235 million. In addition to the items just mentioned, our reported amount also includes a net $2 million increase in adjusted items, primarily from realignment expenses. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5%, just 30 basis points lower compared to prior year. While our adjusted gross margins this quarter were essentially equivalent to those of the 2023 third quarter, I am very pleased that the sequential adjusted operating margins expanded by 180 basis points for a nearly 40% sequential incremental. On a reported basis, fourth quarter operating margins decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 9.4%. Due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, the onetime discrete SG&A items previously discussed and a $6 million increase in adjusted items compared to the prior year, again primarily related to the realignment actions. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 7.8% was notably lower than expected, primarily due to the release of valuation allowance on certain net foreign deferred tax assets. Our reported rate of 5.6% reflects the items just mentioned as well as the tax impact associated with realignment charges, which we excluded from our adjusted results.Turning to our full year results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, a 91% increase year-over-year. The performance exceeded our latest revised guidance range from October of $1.95 to $2.05 and with nearly 30% above the midpoint of our initial 2023 target range we provided this time a year ago. Our full year 2023 revenues were over $4.3 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the prior year as our backlog conversion cadence significantly improved with our operational performance. On this sales level, we generated adjusted gross margins of 30.1% for the year, modestly exceeding our prior expectations. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to expand margins further by accelerating our operational excellence initiatives and ongoing product management of our portfolio. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.9% for the year, representing our lowest level since 2015. This performance was driven by our focus on cost containment, including the benefits from our recent cost-out program and organizational redesign as well as increasing top line leverage. While we are pleased with the progress we have made to date, we know that the work on this front is never done, and we will remain focused on driving even better results. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, a meaningful increase of 330 basis points over the prior year. Both FCD and FPD delivered solid 2023 performance, keeping pace with significant increases in adjusted segment operating margin of roughly 320 and 330 basis points, respectively, to 14% and 12.4%. Looking ahead, we are well positioned towards our longer-term 2027 consolidated adjusted operating margin target of 14% to 16% that we shared at our Analyst Day in September. Our adjusted tax rate of 15.1% for the full year finished below our previous expectations, primarily driven by the release of valuation allowances on specific foreign net deferred tax assets as we believe those benefits will now be realized based on our improving financial results and help mitigate future cash taxes. Turning now to cash flow. We delivered outstanding full year operating cash flow of $326 million, which represented a nearly $366 million year-over-year improvement. In addition to our higher earnings, I'm also very pleased that we improved cash from working capital by nearly $240 million, and our cash conversion cycle decreased by roughly 10 days compared to 2022. During the fourth quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $195 million, an increase of $125 million compared to the prior year. The improvement can largely be attributed to our strong working capital performance. Accounts receivable was a modest source of cash this quarter despite our increased revenues, but represented a $77 million improvement compared to the prior year. Collections results have been robust all year. But notably are evidenced by the nearly 7-day reduction in our days sales outstanding year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Inventory also contributed to working capital progress as we've reduced the cash used by over $50 million for both the fourth quarter and the full year compared to the respective periods of 2022. As a percent of sales, we improved our year-end primary working capital by approximately 450 basis points to 27.9% and improved sequentially by 260 basis points as well.We made great strides towards reducing our working capital and investment to our 25% to 27% long-term target and it will remain a major focus area for us going forward. Capital expenditures were $20 million during the quarter, bringing this year's free cash flow to $175 million. This year -- this year-over-year improvement exceeds $100 million and resulted in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion of 194%. Other significant uses of cash in the fourth quarter included $26 million for dividends and a $10 million term loan reduction.Turning to our 2024 outlook. We expect to continue building on our operating momentum to deliver full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with adjusted earnings per share between $2.40 to $2.60, both consistent with the qualitative guidance we provided at our September Analyst Day. At the midpoint, our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance represents a roughly 20% increase over last year. As Scott mentioned, our markets continue to remain active, and we expect to generate a full year book-to-bill ratio over 1x, building backlog to spur multiyear revenue growth. We also expect net interest expense in the range of $60 million to $65 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 20%. Our adjusted targets exclude expected realignment expenses of approximately $30 million as well as other potential items that may occur during the year, such as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other discrete items. Including the potential realignment spending, we expect our reported EPS to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. Similar to last year, we will work to minimize top line reduction as we move from the sequentially strong last quarter of the year to the first quarter. That said, we would anticipate our general trend of seasonality and earnings will continue in 2024, with the first quarter being our lowest earnings quarter of the year and the fourth quarter being the strongest.We intend to further drive value creation through our capital allocation approach. As we weigh opportunities to allocate capital, we are guided by our enduring framework to deploy excess cash to the highest long-term return while remaining impartial as to how value is created. Our Board has authorized a 5% increase to our dividend to $0.21 per share. Additionally, the Board also replenished our authorized share repurchase capacity to $300 million. As we indicated at the Analyst Day, we view share repurchases to offset equity compensation as a commitment and with the increased capacity of the new plan, we also can act opportunistically. That said, we believe there are ample opportunities to invest in the business, both through internal programs and inorganic growth. We expect capital expenditures between $75 million and $85 million this year, and we are well positioned to pursue M&A opportunities to further expand our portfolio of flow control offerings to better support and accelerate our 3D strategy. We are most interested in targets that provide the opportunity to leverage our scale and that can be effectively integrated with our broader business. Financial discipline and economic returns are table stakes. So the returns on any acquisition would be in excess of our average cost of capital as well as the margin and cash EPS accretive. Through it all, our capital allocation approach is designed to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we intend to reduce our term loan by $60 million this year.I am proud of the strong foundation we established during 2023 and feel confident that we can drive continued margin and earnings per share growth, while deploying capital to deliver long-term shareholder value as we progress towards our longer-term targets. I fully expect 2024 to be a great start on that journey. Let me now return the call to Scott."", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Great. Thank you, Amy. Let me now offer a few comments on our 3D strategy, which, as we discussed at our September Analyst Day, is directly aligned with the market environment that we see today and in the future. The strategy is intended to drive accelerated growth for Flowserve for years to come. While we are well suited to serve our customer base today, we are continuing to invest in product and service offerings, including through potential inorganic opportunities that further build our portfolio to support diverse markets in the new emerging sources of energy.Let me start with diversify where our bookings remain very healthy in 2023 as we continue to apply our portfolio into served end markets that present an above-average growth profile. Our vacuum pump products are a great example of our efforts and represent a significant component of the diversification pillar. Our focus to grow our vacuum products in general industrial applications has delivered outsized growth over the last several years. In the fourth quarter, we were selected to supply dry vacuum pumps for a state-of-the-art green solvents production facility in Europe that will support the circular economy. The site will convert biomass waste into 1,000 metric tons of nontoxic solvents annually to be utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, electronics and other applications. Moving to decarbonize. We produced another quarter of strong bookings led by nuclear and LNG awards. We remain excited about the nuclear outlook as countries around the globe are focused on providing clean and reliable energy within their borders. We continue to be very optimistic on the nuclear outlook as countries begin to develop investment plans that have nuclear energy output tripling by 2050. Our strong portfolio of nuclear pumps, valves and seals are well positioned to meet this growing demand, including life extensions on existing assets and the building of new nuclear power facilities in Asia and Europe. New energy applications are another key driver behind our decarbonized initiative. Flowserve was recently selected to supply our specialty ball valves to support the production of liquid green hydrogen in the United States. This project is expected to produce nearly 11,000 tons of hydrogen to enable operations for one of the world's largest e-commerce companies.Lastly, on digitize. We believe our ability to digitize our solutions and leverage our large installed base and aftermarket capabilities will enable Flowserve to be better equipped to provide true solutions for our customers. We believe our offering is at an inflection point of growth, and we have significant visibility to new installations. We now have over 80 customer locations using RedRaven technology with almost 2,100 assets instrumented. We remain committed to adding value to our customers with this digital offering by instrumenting pumps and valves to monitor, predict and ultimately better optimize the full flow loop. Flowserve recently partnered with 3 European-based petrochemical facilities to increase reliability and efficiency with our RedRaven technology. We are pleased to continue expanding our IoT presence in petrochemicals, an industry where we are seeing an increasing level of acceptance, providing us with an opportunity to offer more of our solutions portfolio and capabilities to help solve our customers' toughest flow control challenges.In conclusion, I'm extremely pleased with our progress in 2023. The new organization design is driving enhanced execution, improved accountability and is allowing us to operate with speed. This new design better supports our 3D strategy and will allow Flowserve to further our advantage in securing the market opportunities in front of us. I'm confident in our ability to maintain the momentum created in 2023 and continue driving improvements in 2024 and beyond. The trajectory to our longer-term financial goals outlined at our Analyst Day begins with the delivery of our 2024 targets, including 4% to 6% revenue growth, more than 100 basis points adjusted operating margin improvement and roughly 20% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance. Finally, I am pleased that our efforts and strategy continue to be recognized by third-party organizations. In recent weeks, Flowserve was named by the Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies and we are named in Forbes list of most successful mid-cap companies in 2024. The financial and operational performance we delivered last year creates a solid foundation to build upon, and I am excited about the opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. We have substantially improved our ability to execute and serve our customers, and I'm confident that this progress will carry into 2024 as we expect to deliver another significant year of improved financial results. We are fully focused this year on profitably converting our near-record $2.7 billion backlog, continuing our pursuit of outsized growth driven by our 3D strategy, and driving higher operating margins through further operational improvements. We remain committed to driving long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to open the call to questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Nathan Jones with Stifel."", 'Nathan Hardie Jones', ""I'm going to start with the questions on the bookings outlook. I think, Amy, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a book-to-bill above 1. Scott, in your -- as you talked about growth in the pipeline. I think the book-to-bill above 1 kind of implies mid- to high single-digit bookings growth. So -- just any more color you can give us on how that splits out between projects and aftermarket? What kind of projects are in the pipeline and the confidence that those will convert to orders this year?"", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Sure. Yes. It's a really good question, Nathan. Let me start with aftermarket and then I'll go to kind of traditional end markets, and I'll touch on projects as well. On the aftermarket side, we saw tremendous growth in 2023. We delivered about 5% for the full Flowserve and we expect that to continue. And so when we look at utilization rates and we look at kind of what's happening with the customer installations, we see that, that aftermarket work will continue as we go forward.And then secondly, we believe there's an ability to drive our capture rate up. We're -- we don't disclose what that rate is. But what I'll say is we know we have opportunities to do better there. And in the Analyst Day, we outlined some of those opportunities, both on the pump side and the valve side. And so we believe we've got kind of market share or capture rate opportunities on top of what we'll say is a very constructive environment for our aftermarket business. So we see something similar to 2023 in terms of growing that side of the business. And then like the Analyst Day or within the Analyst Day, we talked about our traditional end markets, and we showed kind of some like more GDP-type results at this 3% to 5% growth for those end markets. And again, when we look at our model, nothing has changed there. And so we see reasonably good growth on the traditional end markets across the board. And then where we see really exciting growth is in the new energy and the decarbonization side. And so that's where we see that outsized growth above that kind of 3% to 5%. And we had a really good year in 2023 across all aspects of our business in terms of bookings growth with the exception of large projects. And so when we look at our project funnel, what we see is the project funnel overall is up 13%. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25%, and that decarbonization of new energy is up 25%. And so that gives us a lot of confidence on our project outlook and making sure that we can acquire and win awards that makes sense on our margins and value creation. And so I'd say, overall, we feel really good about where we are in terms of the overall market and the outlook. And I think we can -- at this point, we believe that we can deliver certainly above 1.0 on our book-to-bill and drive to that 5% growth target that we put out in the Analyst Day."", 'Nathan Hardie Jones', ""One follow-up on orders and specifically, the oil and gas pipeline being up 25%. That's obviously still your biggest end market. And so that's one that could move the needle. And probably where the large projects are as well. Does this above 1.0 include the conversion of any large projects? Or would those be kind of gravy on top and what's your confidence that they actually get awarded in '24."", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Yes. The project market in oil and gas has stacked up pretty substantially. It's primarily delivered -- or primarily in the Middle East. And I was there 3 weeks ago -- and quite frankly, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work that's out there and the spending that's happening. Now obviously, things could change that -- but I would say with Saudi's 2030 vision with what we see in the rest of the region across countries like the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the activity is substantial. And so to your question directly, there's a long list of large projects out there. If we get 2 or 3 of those, that would be gravy to compare to what we're talking about, but I would say there are a couple of those projects that are kind of more moderate size that are embedded in our growth projections.But again, we feel good about it. We've been very selective, specifically in 2023 in terms of what we want to win. We've been very disciplined in that approach. And I feel really good that we're going to start to win some work, but win work that makes sense from a margin perspective and value creation perspective."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Mike Halloran with Baird."", 'Michael Patrick Halloran', 'Maybe we just follow up on the comment you just made there. Certainly, understand the diligence behind project selection and where you want to win and focus on the margins. But when you take a step back, how would you describe the overall competitive landscape right now, given the amount of opportunity out there, you see a little bit more diligence from some of the competitor base or just a little bit more logical pricing mechanisms? Or is it still pretty project by project? Any thought on that side?', 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Sure. If we compare it to -- let's go to 2 years ago when folks were very, very hungry for work. The environment is substantially better than that. But what I'll say is the project environment is always attractive. Everybody wants to bid and participate in it. And so it remains somewhat challenging. And so through our selected bidding approach, what we're looking at is customers we know we can work with, customers where we know that we can deliver the margin expectations that we signed up for in the bidding phase. And then we're also looking for making sure that we can get the aftermarket associated with the work there. .And so I think that's probably the biggest change for us is really getting a more holistic look at what we wanted to work or what we want to work on geographically, but then also with the customers in supporting that aftermarket.And then when we think about the competitive landscape, everybody is substantially fuller in terms of capacity than what we saw 2 years ago. We are seeing discipline improve pretty substantially, but every now and then, we'll get a surprise by somebody that doesn't kind of stay in that disciplined approach. And we'll just accept that and move on and make sure that we can win work that's more suitable to the margin expectations that we deserve."", 'Michael Patrick Halloran', ""Great. Makes sense. And then good to see the cash generation this quarter. Could you maybe talk to the '24 expectations that layer it as well usage of that cash, the buyback authorization (inaudible) certainly (inaudible) remarks around it. Is there any more intent there to be opportunistic? And how do you see the M&A landscape with the cash generation?"", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Sure. So I'd start with our expectations continue -- or continue to generate nice levels of cash as we move into 2024. At the Analyst Day, we talked about kind of a guiding principal between 80% and 100% free cash flow conversion, I think we'll be at the low end or slightly below that in 2024, just given some of the realignment activities that we expect to continue to occur.In terms of capital allocation, I think that what we wanted to do with this most recent action with the Board is to really just increase the opportunity set that we have out there. Modest dividend increase, acknowledging that we had not had an increase in our dividend level since early in 2020. And then again, at the Analyst Day, we had recommitted to the practice of share buybacks to offset equity dilution. We've not done that in the last couple of years. So we want the opportunity to be able to do that. So that's probably a little bit of catch-up this year. I will say, overall, I think that our bias, which needs to be tested each time we have the opportunity is to invest those dollars either in internal growth or inorganic growth to boost really our top line, find opportunities that are accretive to margins and EPS and ultimately grow earnings for our shareholders. But I think that with the actions the Board took this year, we have an opportunity to have a full suite of options available to us as we make our way into 2024."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America."", 'Sabrina Lee Abrams', ""You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew. So some of your competitors have talked about seeing 100 to 200 bps of better margin backlog relative to what's shipping through the P&L today. Is that a fair framework for what Flowserve is shipping in 2024 relative to its P&L?"", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""I'd say we definitely see improvement in the pricing of our backlog, and some of that is obviously dependent on mix that you currently have in our backlog. But I think that we see that margin in backlog as a real tailwind for us going into 2024."", 'Sabrina Lee Abrams', ""Got it. And as a follow-up, I guess I'm thinking about the different components of the margins. So you have better pricing in the backlog. There's the mix benefit from aftermarket outgrowing OE and some incremental benefit from the restructuring program. So if you could talk about maybe the different components, the good guys and bad guys and the margin bridge for 2024. Just want to understand the components of the 100 bps of expansion that you guys are guiding to?"", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Sure. So I'll start by saying we are confident in our ability to expand margins by the 100 basis points or more. And as we think about our guidance range, I would say our ability to move towards the high end of that range would likely mean margin expansion above that 100 basis points versus volume growth, given that we saw sales volume growth of nearly 20% in 2023. So where we're at in terms of puts and takes, neutral from a -- to a slightly positive on price cost from a material inflation standpoint, you've already touched on the margin in backlog, which we see as a positive. And we do have the structural cost savings from both the org redesign that we put in place and the activities that are taking shape with respect to ops excellence. In terms of what's working against us in 2024, I would start with labor inflation is something that will begin to take hold kind of late in the first quarter and really start to show up in the second quarter of the year. And then although we do have a nice backlog of aftermarket mix, I think the mix of project work is going to be something that we'll be monitoring and watching closely in terms of margin expectations in 2024. And I'd start with what Scott has described as a large funnel of FPD large project work that we'll have available for us in 2024. And although those will be at margins better than what we saw -- than what we saw kind of 18, 24, 36 months ago, and those are still lower than our aftermarket more run rate work. And secondarily, on the FCD slide, that backlog is actually right now skewed more towards project work or OE work than aftermarket. That backlog is about 300 basis points more OE this year at this time than it was last year. So that's the other piece of project mix that we're looking at."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Joe Giordano with TD Cowen."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""On LNG, obviously, a lot going on with what the President has been saying about LNG export and things like that. Is that globally fungible to you guys? Like do you care where terminals are built? Like if we do less here? Or is it just going to have to be somewhere else and you'll be there?"", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Yes. I would say our LNG work is more outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so we've got substantial bookings and opportunities in the Middle East. We've got some work on the books for Latin America, Africa. We've got a round 2 in Canada that we expect. And so I think we still feel good about the outlook of LNG. I won't get into the politics of this, but we think natural gas is an incredible transition source of energy, and we believe it's going to be a part of the mix for a long time to come. I think the U.S. exporting permit hold will potentially have an impact on our kind of 2025 business, but 2024 work in the U.S. has already been funded and already been approved. And so it won't have an impact on what we see in 2024. And we'll continue to migrate more of our products and services into cryogenic applications to support LNG because we're big believers in this over the next 10 to 15 years."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""Just on that point on cryo, obviously, the Velan acquisition didn't work out. You bought technology -- you bought R&D from Chart, -- like where are you with cryo kind of pumping applications? Is there more you need to do maybe an update there? And kind of related to that, is on your 3D, is there like fundamentally -- are margins basically the same there as in more established markets for you guys now? Or is that a gap you still need to close?"", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Yes, I'll answer that one first because it's easy. The 3D and certainly, the energy transition margin expectations are basically in line with the rest of the portfolio. And then back to cryogenic applications, I'd say the bow portfolio is more rounded out than the pumps at this point. And so we've got control valves. We have isolation valves that can all do cryogenic, both LNG and hydrogen. There are opportunities, though, to grow that pretty substantially. And what we liked about Velan is they were better positioned with some of their technology and products than we were. And so continued M&A work on expanding that cryogenic portfolio in valves will continue to happen in 2024 and beyond. And then on the pump side, we've got kind of 2 things. The acquisition that we did with Chart was really around hydrogen distribution, but we can take that technology and know-how imply it into LNG and cryogenic applications. And so we're in the very late stages of developing a full cryogenic pump offering. And that, what we really like about that is it can be used for liquefaction transportation and into the regas application. And so by the -- certainly, by kind of mid-year, late year, we'll have a full kind of cryogenic pumping solution that will serve -- that can be potentially used in -- well we used in LNG but potentially used in hydrogen as well."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets."", 'Deane Michael Dray', ""I would like to circle back on the comments regarding the mix of bookings this quarter, really interesting that no big orders, which kind of gives you a strong sense of the underlying demand that you're seeing, but I'd love to hear some commentary. You called out both some project delays as well as selectivity. Can you just kind of give us directionally how much of an impact were the delays versus selectivity. And then maybe just -- I don't know if there's any other factors that would have kept the larger orders to a minimum this quarter, but just size for us the impact of each."", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Yes. So in Q4, we had visibility to, let's call it, 2 or 3 awards, more on the pump side than the valve side that did get delayed. And some of that was delayed into Q1 and some of it is going to be delayed until probably the back half of the year. And as you know, you followed our business a long time. There's lots of reasons for delays. Project timing is incredibly hard to predict. But what I would say is those opportunities did not get canceled. They didn't get turned off, they might be slightly smaller, a little bit different than what we anticipated, but we're confident that they go forward in 2024. And we're also confident given the selectivity that those will deliver the margins that we deserve as we go forward.And then I'd just say on the selectivity side and turning things off I think that was a trend predominantly throughout the whole year. There wasn't something major that we kind of missed out on in Q4. It's more about just putting the right resources upfront and doing the work that's required to prepare for these large tenders. And so when something comes out, it's we're pulling the entire team. There's usually anywhere from 10 to 30 people that are working on these. And we've just been really selective at the front end and directing our resources to things that we think make more sense economically and can support that customer through the life cycle of their asset. So I'd say the Q4 was probably more a little bit of slip out than being selective, but again, we feel really good about what we're seeing in 2024 on the projects."", 'Deane Michael Dray', ""That's great color. And just what's the balancing act that you have to do when the higher you ratchet up selectivity, then the downside is you missed kind of building the installed base and your ability to capture aftermarket. And look, the winner's curse on these bigger deals is that there is margin pressure. So there is a balancing act, but maybe you can just share with us some of the mechanics."", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""It is a delicate balancing act, Deane. And I'll just say between Amy and myself and Lamar Duhon, who leads our pumps division that's probably the single biggest topic that we have with him and his team. And it's not easy because we do know when you get the installed base, it's pulling our seal business through, it's pulling parts through, it's pulling service through. And so we are actively, we're actively pursuing installed base. At the same time, we're now modeling that out and looking at it on a returns basis. And so we can more accurately predict, like is that customer going to give us the aftermarket? Or do they go out and bid some of that aftermarket? And so we can kind of model in what that probability of success looks like on the aftermarket and make much better decisions about where we'll populate the installed base and where we won't.And so I'd say we've improved dramatically in the last year about what we should pursue and where we shouldn't, but continuing to have a robust installed base and continuing to drive aftermarket support is important. And then the other thing I would say is we're also now with our aftermarket franchise and some of our business processes there that continue to improve on speed in winning we're starting to win aftermarket work for third-party equipment. And so that's something we steered away from probably 4 or 5 years ago. We're not openly going out and targeting our competitive aftermarket. But with our presence there with our ability to drive speed and serve our customers in a timely manner, we're starting to see more and more work on stuff that's not necessarily our original equipment."", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""And I might just put an exclamation point on that from a portfolio perspective because we've committed to long-term targets in terms of both revenue growth and margin expansion. And what we're trying to do is expand our installed base within the constraints of those -- that margin expansion and volume growth paradigm. So I think as Scott pointed out, we're in a better position than we've ever been to do that. But as you can imagine, as a finance person, I absolutely love the aftermarket capture rate strategy and trying to be more aggressive about going after that higher margin business."", 'Deane Michael Dray', ""All right. I appreciate all that insight. And just one other question, and it's for Amy, that's really impressive free cash flow this quarter. Just where do you stand now on the whole releasing of buffer inventory? You gave lots of specifics about how much of each of the components of working capital improved, I'd be interested in hearing a bit more about what we're seeing on these releases of buffer inventory now with the supply chain is normalizing. So how much more do you have to go there?"", 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Yes. So I'll start. I think that 2024 from a working capital perspective was a journey. We saw collections throughout 2024 or 2023, excuse me, be quite strong. We were pleased with the way the organization collaborated with that to make sure that we got those where we wanted them to be. And really, the third and the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to set ourselves up for inventory reduction by the end of the year, and that was partially sales volume, partially our planning processes getting better. .If I were to put this in baseball terms, I think we're still in the, call it, the fourth inning of inventory reduction. I think we can continue to get smarter with that and our planning -- and our improvement of planning processes is really playing a key role in that. I think we're going to continue to make progress on that within 2024, but we've made it clear to the organization that we've also committed to growth. And so we have to be very smart about how we reduce that inventory over time and where and how we do that.So I feel like we're striking the right balance, but we're going to march methodically towards that 25% to 27% working capital target."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is James on for Saree. So I just wanted to kind of go back on the margins in the backlogs. So I think you said the margins are coming at a higher levels. But I think you said the orders are still not at the 2019 margin levels. So where does that stand now? And what is the missing gap here since the demand seems strong?', 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Yes. So I would probably stop short of saying that we're not at 2019 margin levels yet in backlog. I think along the way, we're making progress from an operational excellence standpoint. We're working smarter at our facilities. And frankly, we're playing in different markets than we did in 2019 as we look at the as we look at the growth of those 3D and energy transition markets. So I certainly think that the margins in backlog today are a tailwind for us going in going into 2024. But we're going to continue to do the things that we need to do to improve that as we convert backlog into revenue. And that's really around making the most of the structural cost savings that we have in place and embedding operational excellence into each and every one of our facilities and processes. And then really ramping up our activities with respect to product management and using that as a lever. I think that becomes a lever more in the back half of 20 than it is in the front half, but I expect that to be an area that we continue to progress and build momentum as we make our way through the year."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Got it. And I kind of wanted to ask on the FCD. I think the margins here expanded nicely and kind of reached the long-term target of the segment. So can you kind of talk about the drivers here, kind of add more color here? And how should we think about the margin for FCD going into 2024?', 'Amy B. Schwetz', ""Yes. FCD has been a great story from a margin expansion standpoint in 2023. And how they ended the year was actually right in line with what our expectations were for them in 2023. I think as we move into 2024, we'll see that moderate a bit with volume in the first quarter of the year and continue to make their way up sequentially again. .The real headwind that FCD is going to have in 2024 is around mix. in that they are now more focused in their backlog towards project versus aftermarket. There's about a 300 basis point shift there in terms of the makeup of backlog. So that aftermarket strength we talk about in mix is really occurring on the FPD side. So I would imagine that initially during 2024, we'll see that margin expansion more on the FPD side than on FCD."", 'Robert Scott Rowe', ""Yes. And I just add overall on margins. We had communicated earlier in the year that we were striving to get to 30% gross margins for the portfolio. We did that a little bit earlier than we expected. And so we feel really good about that margin trajection as we go forward. And as Amy said, it's going to come more on the pump side in 2024 than on the FCD side, but we still see nice progression forward and very much on the trajectory alignment toward our 2027 goals."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. That will conclude our Q&A portion, and it also will conclude the Flowserve Corporation fourth quarter 2023 conference call. You may now disconnect.']"

If you want to skip our discussion on the electric utility industry, head directly to 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Right Now.\xa0', 'In the face of a continuously changing energy landscape, US utilities maintain three primary objectives according to Ernst & Young (EY) – ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. The utilities sector in 2024 requires a careful balance between conventional and innovative funding approaches to advance these priorities. Presently, utility executives are better equipped than ever to decisively navigate the transformative decisions required for the future. Initial focus should be on three primary opportunities – (1) Strengthening the balance sheet to support investment strategies that generate enduring value for stakeholders, (2) Optimizing newly accessible capital, such as grants and tax credits, to expedite the energy transition for power and utility companies, and (3) Upgrading technology to advance business operations.', 'In 2023, the US power and utilities industry experienced advancements in decarbonization, increased deployment of solar power and energy storage, and improved grid reliability. As per a recent Deloitte report, the sector faced mixed fundamentals, with a slight decrease in electricity sales due to mild weather. Wholesale electricity prices dropped in response to lower natural gas costs, but high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, coupled with rising interest rates, contributed to potential customer bill increases. The industry also grappled with costs related to disaster recovery, cybersecurity, and climate-related challenges. Despite lower fuel costs, retail electricity prices were projected to increase by 1.9% year-over-year, with residential prices potentially rising by 4.7%. In 2024, electricity prices are expected to stabilize, with a forecasted 2% increase in sales. The industry may focus on electrification, resource adequacy, and addressing rising costs, exploring the potential use of AI, including generative AI, to tackle challenges.\xa0', ""In 2023, utilities faced a decline as investor preference shifted from defensive stocks to mega-cap growth companies, particularly in the technology and communication services sectors. This led to utilities being one of the weakest-performing sectors in the S&P 500. However, by late 2023, utilities stocks experienced significantly lower valuations, trading at one of the largest discounts to the S&P in the past two decades, according to a Fidelity report. The utility sector's near-term performance may continue to be influenced by investor sentiment and economic conditions in 2024. If the economy maintains a soft landing with strong growth and low inflation, utilities may remain out of favor. Conversely, in the face of economic weakness, investors could turn back to defensive stocks like utilities, known for stability, durable cash flows, and dividends, especially during market volatility. A decline in interest rates could further benefit utility stocks by making their dividends more attractive compared to bonds. "", 'Looking at the longer term, utilities are positioned at the center of the shift from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to accelerate this transition by providing incentives for the adoption of clean-energy options and reducing greenhouse gasses. Consumers, businesses, and governments are actively working to decrease their carbon footprints, and forecasts suggest a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'Some of the best electric utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

Meanwhile, asking rents for one-bedroom units rebounded after declining since July 2023, increasing by 0.1% year over year to $1,591 in January.

She declined to offer new details on what type of government grant the company might receive but underlined her focus on AI.', '""For you, frankly, it\'s a source of great upside and opportunity and customers,"" she told Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger at the event that also featured Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.', 'Other major players in AI chip manufacturing, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Micron (MU), are also expected to receive billions and are currently in talks with the government.', '""These are intensive negotiations; we are in the thick of it now with our major applicants,"" a senior administration official said this week, promising further announcements would be coming within weeks.', 'Thus far, three smaller manufacturing awards have been promised to BAE Systems (BAESY), Microchip Technology, and GlobalFoundries (GFS).', ""The administration also recently announced a likely award of $5 billion for a public-private consortium called the National Semiconductor Technology Center to quarterback the administration's research efforts."", ""Raimondo oversees a team that has ballooned to more than 200 people charged with implementing the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation that was signed into law 18 months ago and designed to confront America's falling share of semiconductor manufacturing."", 'Raimondo’s CHIPS Strategy Office is made up of scientists, supply chain and workforce specialists, and others.

It will have to compete with China, which is also offering more generous government incentives, and perhaps burgeoning private efforts like Altman's goal of raising up to $7 trillion for semiconductor manufacturing, according to a Wall Street Journal report."", 'The plan has garnered a skeptical media and industry response to whether such a project is possible, as well as the tone Altman has taken. Altman recently posted an apparent reference to the project — and suggested perhaps it could seek an even more astronomical sum — asking, ""why not 8"" as well as a shorthand for an expletive.', 'Either way, a wide range of officials agree that demand for AI chips will be high. On Wednesday, Raimondo referenced recent talks with Altman and others in the AI space, noting ""the volume of chips that they project they need is mind-boggling, even if you take their projections and cut them in half.""', ""The US is running behind.

This is an arena where the US is comfortably positioned at the moment but one that could be disrupted quickly.', 'For one thing, AI is already bringing a flood of new participants into chip designing business. Giants from Google (GOOG) to Amazon (AMZN) are already showing more interest as they seek designs to fuel their AI initiatives.', 'Arati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, recently addressed a roomful of industry representatives gathered at the White House and described the administration\'s overall approach as ""creating the transformative pathways that drive the technology forward but can also reshape the industry.""', '""We want to make sure that that happens in a way that creates advantage for our industry, but also advantage for America,"" she added.', ""O'Donnell added that AI itself could be used to design the next generation of chips, noting that smaller companies like Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

It\'s been about 60 changes in 127 years, so change is a major item, a major consideration. At this point, the thinking... is obviously the economy and the markets have changed and we needed additional exposure and Amazon offers that exposure at this point in time. Also, Walgreens has somewhat declined in stock price so since its price-weighted, it doesn\'t have that much of an impact on there. If you wanted to stay in that field ,you\'d have to find a higher priced stock in there. We also had Walmart\'s 3-for-1 stock split that reduced the weighting within the index.

Amazon set to join the index, taking the place of Walgreens Boot Alliance, that change takes effect prior to the open of trading on Monday, February 26. Now here to discuss the methodology behind it, what it means for that average investor. We want to bring in Howard silverblatt, he's S&P, Dow Jones Indices, a senior index analyst. Howard, it's great to see you here. So just talk about the significance of this change, and what it means to the average investor out there just in terms of their industry exposure, going forward."", ""HOWARD SILERBLATT: Well, there's only 30 issues, it's not the S&P 500. And we do not change the index, S&P does not change the index too often. There's been about 60 changes in 127 years, so a change is a major item a major consideration at this point. The thinking, basically, is obviously the economy, and the markets have changed, and we needed additional exposure. And Amazon offers that exposure at this point in time."", ""Also Walgreens has somewhat declined in stock price. So since it's price weighted doesn't have that much of an impact on that, if you wanted to stay in that field, you'd have to find a higher priced stock in there. We also had Walmart's 3-for-1 stock split that reduced the weighting within the index. So, again, the index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of the US markets on here."", ""And Amazon was a natural selection at this point. Consumers, enterprise, different areas, the exposure that it gives to the index. For the average investor it'll mean that the index itself is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time. And that happens on a regular basis, to some degree. Amazon is no different than when we put Sears Roebuck in the 1920s. It's still a retail where consumers are going. By the way, Sears was taken out in 1999 for a company called Microsoft."", 'Again, the index needs to be relevant. We do not like to change the memberships in there. We prefer the consistency, but at times it has to be done, because as the economy changes, the index has to change.', ""BRAD SMITH: When you have a company like Amazon that is a beneficiary of so many different segments within its business, whether that's Cloud, or whether that's its investments, or its play in AI, or the consumer and strength or resiliency of the consumer, that relevancy also can lead to being lighter fluid when they are especially beneficiary of so many different areas, and potentially propel the Dow to what, 40k very soon as well. And so what type of relevancy, as you make these changes, as we consider in the market's digest these changes, how does that propel us toward some of those other all-time highs as well for the Dow?"", ""HOWARD SILERBLATT: Well, in this case, the actual mechanics of the split, and adding Amazon, actually did increase the target price, that's the estimate for one year, not from S&P, but on the street. We do not choose stocks, based on whether we think they're going to be going up or down. Actually went up to over 42,000 for the one year from the 41,000."", ""As far as the Amazon makeup, yes, some of the other fields that it's getting its sales from, and some of its profits that are still growing, is somewhat of a plus, because it's developing and giving you a bit of exposure in a few other fields where we would have wanted to increase on it. But mostly, you're dealing with the consumer sector, the retail sector, where the bulk of it is in right now. And that's positive, because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy in there. And, again, at this point in time, we're better able to reflect it."", ""And again, the 3-for-1 stock split was kind of the catalyst to the event at this point in time, it wasn't the major reason. You're always reviewing what's in and what's not in the index. And, again, you try not to do a lot of changes. So you really need a reason to be taken out to some degree, such as a merger, or a deterioration, or irrelevant in your price.""]"

With a market capitalization of over $34 billion as of mid-2023, Xcel Energy Inc manages utilities serving 3.8 million electric customers and 2.2 million natural gas customers across eight states. The company has demonstrated a strong commitment to delivering competitive total returns to investors, achieving consistent financial objectives, and leading the clean energy transition. In the fiscal year 2023, Xcel Energy Inc reported revenues of $2,645 million, reflecting its robust financial health and operational efficiency. This SWOT analysis will delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest financial data and strategic priorities outlined in the filing.', 'Leadership in Clean Energy Transition: Xcel Energy Inc stands out for its pioneering vision of achieving 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, with an interim goal of an 80% reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels. This commitment aligns with the Paris Climate Accords and is supported by the company\'s substantial wind capacity, which exceeds 11,000 MW. The ""Steel for Fuel"" strategy has already saved customers nearly $4 billion since 2017, showcasing the company\'s ability to leverage renewable resources for cost savings and environmental benefits.', ""Financial Resilience and Shareholder Value: Xcel Energy Inc's financial performance is a testament to its resilience and strategic execution. With ongoing earnings per share growing annually by 6.3% and dividends per share by 6.5% over the past five years, the company has met or exceeded its earnings guidance for 19 consecutive years. This consistent performance, coupled with a disciplined approach to growth and operations, positions Xcel Energy Inc favorably among investors seeking reliable returns."", ""Regulatory and Operational Risks: As a utility provider, Xcel Energy Inc is subject to extensive regulation and operational risks that can impact its performance. The company's natural gas and electric operations involve hazards such as leaks, explosions, and outages, which could lead to financial losses, environmental pollution, or damage to its reputation. While insurance covers most risks, not all potential events are fully insured, leaving the company exposed to unforeseen liabilities."", ""Dependence on Economic Conditions: Xcel Energy Inc's operations are sensitive to economic fluctuations, which can affect customer growth and energy demand. Factors such as recessions, rising interest rates, or increased unemployment can impact the company's financial health by reducing sales or leading to higher bad debt expenses. This dependence on the broader economy introduces a level of uncertainty in the company's performance."", ""Technological Advancements and Customer Engagement: The ongoing installation of smart electric meters presents an opportunity for Xcel Energy Inc to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency. These meters provide real-time communication, empowering customers to manage their energy usage and costs more effectively.

The company's efforts in fostering economic development and community investment, such as creating jobs and supporting local nonprofits, further solidify its role as a community partner and can enhance its public image and customer loyalty."", ""Competitive Pressures and Market Dynamics: The utility sector is experiencing increased competition from distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Incentives and federal tax subsidies for these alternatives pose a threat to Xcel Energy Inc's traditional electric service business. Additionally, the company's industrial and large commercial customers have the capability to generate their own electricity, which could erode Xcel Energy Inc's market share."", ""Environmental and Public Policy Changes: Xcel Energy Inc's operations and strategic goals are influenced by environmental regulations and public policies. Changes in these areas can impose additional compliance costs or necessitate operational adjustments. The company must navigate these regulatory landscapes effectively to maintain its competitive edge and achieve its sustainability objectives."", 'In conclusion, Xcel Energy Inc (NASDAQ:XEL) exhibits a robust set of strengths, including its leadership in the clean energy transition and a strong track record of financial performance. However, it must navigate inherent weaknesses such as regulatory and operational risks, as well as economic dependencies. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities presented by technological advancements and infrastructure investments. Nevertheless, it faces threats from competitive pressures and evolving environmental policies. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Xcel Energy Inc can continue to seize opportunities and mitigate threats, ensuring its long-term success in a dynamic energy market.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Energy drinks come in a variety of flavors and variants, and they can be stocked well in advance to allow 'binge' drinking for the really ambitious. Some common substances found in energy drinks are caffeine and taurine, with the latter often being exclusive to energy drinks or other carbonated beverages instead of being also found in, say, coffee."", 'Over the years, the global energy drink industry has also grown from being limited to a few players to seeing greater focus from big players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). With market capitalizations of $258 billion and $228 billion, they are among the biggest companies in the world that demonstrate that no matter how popular coffee is, at the end of the day a diversified business model can cater to tight consumer budgets during an economic contraction are still perceived to be worth more by both professional and retail investors.', ""Yet one of the most popular energy drink brands in the world, i.e. Red Bull, is private. Red Bull's advertisement campaigns have seen it associate its brand name with high risk activities such as the highest altitude parachute jump in the world and customized sports car racing, and when compared to its American counterpart Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), it can be safely assumed that Red Bull has a far greater brand reach."", 'Delving deeper into the current performance and environment of the energy drink industry, these companies tend to thrive the most when consumers have more money to spend. After all, while energy drinks are popular, they still are not essential daily use products such as toilet paper and toothpaste. However, they cannot be purely classified as cyclical either, especially since a lot of energy drink users consume them daily and might skip out on other purchases to keep up their consumption during tough economic times. As an example, consider research published in the BMC Public Health journal. It used data from 266 commercial bus drivers, a physically intensive job that can require hours of sustained concentration to safely operate a vehicle to show that 32% of the drivers drank seven to ten bottles of energy drinks a week - or more than one bottle a day. Additionally, three quarters believed that drinking energy drinks would improve their work performance, and the majority were unaware of any adverse health effects.', ""Shifting towards the corporate side of things, a brief look at the latest financial results of Monster Beverage and Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is warranted. Both of them had missed analyst EPS estimates for their fourth quarter of 2022 financials, but since then, they have either met or beaten them. During the third quarter of 2023, Celsius's revenue grew by a whopping 104% annually to sit at $385 million. The corresponding press release highlighted that these gains came on the back of an improved logistics chain that increased product availability and allowed the firm to drive up sales. Monster, a bigger company, also marked revenue growth during the quarter, as its revenue grew by 14.3% to sit at $1.86 billion."", ""Additionally, the firm's management shared during the earnings conference:"", 'According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain.

Management believes this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for the Company’s current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage sustained.', 'To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below), during the reporting periods being compared.', 'We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.', 'The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.', 'Similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.', 'Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of December\xa031, 2023, 75 have been classified as comparable hotels.

Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.', 'NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES', 'Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.', 'NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE ', 'We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.', 'We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.', 'Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share ', 'We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:', 'Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.', 'Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.', 'Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.', 'Severance Expense –In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.', 'In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.', 'EBITDA ', 'Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.', 'EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre ', 'We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.', 'We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:', 'Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.', 'Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.', 'Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.', 'Severance Expense – In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.', 'In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.', 'Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre ', 'We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only), severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.', 'Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments, and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.', 'Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results', 'We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or ""same store,"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.', 'Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole.

But there is often a trade-off when it comes to high payouts, as high yields may not always be sustainable. ', ""One metric investors often rely on to help assess the safety of the dividend is the payout ratio. That's the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out to its investors as dividend income. When it goes over 100%, this is a concern as it means the company isn't earning enough to cover its dividend."", 'Three stocks that pay more than a 5% dividend yield and also have alarmingly high payout ratios of more than 100% right now are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM). Are these stocks that are likely to cut their payouts in the near future?', ""Healthcare giant Pfizer provides investors with a fairly high yield of 6.1%. That's 4 times higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. But investors may be dissuaded from investing in the healthcare company for the dividend as Pfizer reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) totaling just $0.37 in 2023 -- that's less than even its quarterly dividend payment of $0.42. "", ""At first glance, Pfizer's dividend would appear to be unsustainable and due for a cut. The company experienced a 42% decrease in revenue last year as revenue from its COVID-19 products diminished. "", 'But the big reason the company\'s bottom line was so poor was that Pfizer also wrote off COVID product inventory, which impacted its earnings. The company\'s adjusted EPS was $1.84, and Pfizer projects that will increase to at least $2.05 for the current year. Pfizer is planning to save $4 billion in expenses through a ""cost realignment"" program. ', ""Overall, there is some risk with Pfizer's dividend but it isn't overly concerning. The company is in the midst of a transition away from COVID-19 products and its recent acquisition of oncology company Seagen also means that it will need to trim some costs related to that purchase. This has the potential to be an underrated buy as Pfizer's stock is trading at a fairly modest 12 times its estimated future profits. "", 'Pipeline company Enbridge pays an even higher dividend yield of 7.9%. For 2023, the Canadian-based oil and gas business reported earnings totaling 5.8 billion Canadian dollars, for an EPS of 2.84 Canadian dollars. On an annual basis, Enbridge pays CA$3.66 in dividends per share. If you were filtering out stocks with payout ratios in excess of 100%, you could end up skipping this stock, and that could be a mistake.', ""In Enbridge's case, the company incurs significant depreciation expenses as it is an asset-heavy business, and that can often make its earnings look underwhelming. But it and many other oil and gas stocks rely on distributable cash flow (DCF) to help assess the safety of their payouts. This is a calculation that more closely resembles cash flow than accounting profits. Last year, the company's DCF of CA$11.3 billion rose by CA$0.3 billion from 2022. With 2.1 billion shares outstanding, that puts its DCF per share at around CA$5.30. "", 'Enbridge has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years and is one of the safer oil and gas stocks for income investors to rely on. Its high payout ratio is misleading as this can be an excellent dividend stock to buy and hold.', 'Tobacco company Philip Morris International pays a dividend that yields 5.8%, which is also well above the S&P 500 average. For 2023, its diluted EPS of $5.02 came in less than its current annualized dividend rate of $5.20 per share. ', ""This company's net revenue of $35.2 billion rose by an impressive rate of nearly 11%. But Philip Morris' operating income totaled $11.6 billion and fell by 6% as the company incurred many expenses related to impairment, acquisitions, and geopolitical issues. Its adjusted operating income of $13.3 billion rose by 3%. "", ""Philip Morris' dividend may appear to be sustainable for now, but this is the riskiest payout on the list. The company faces an uncertain future as it still relies heavily on cigarettes. Last year, Philip Morris' cigarette shipments were down 1.4% but still totaled 612.9 billion versus 125.3 billion for heated tobacco units. And the jury's still out on just how much safer heated tobacco products are than cigarettes.

High-yield dividend stocks are prime investments for stability and growth potential in the financial markets. The article focuses on securing a golden year with investments in the listed seven companies that have established themselves as industry leaders. These companies offer lucrative dividend yields with solid growth trajectories supported by strategic initiatives.', 'Under ongoing economic uncertainty, more than traditional investments may be needed to ensure a comfortable retirement. However, one can unlock a steady income stream by strategically allocating assets to high-yield dividend stocks. Meanwhile, one can benefit from capital appreciation. The article presents potential opportunities for savvy investors, from tobacco giants to real estate titans, to maximize returns.', 'Read more about these high-yield dividend stocks, their performance, growth trends, and strategic maneuvers.

Altria supports the dividend payout with solid bottom-line performance. Specifically, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) by\xa02.3%\xa0(Q4 2023). Dividends and share repurchases totaled nearly $7.8 billion during 2023, indicating the company’s focus on rewarding shareholders.', 'Additionally, the company expects adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1% to 4% for 2024, ranging from $5 to $5.15. In this direction, the company’s projected EPS growth suggests its capability to capitalize on opportunities prevailing in the market.', 'Furthermore, Altria completed the\xa0acquisition\xa0of NJOY (a smoke-free product company). Fundamentally, the acquisition included strategic steps like strengthening supply chains and expanding product distribution. Hence, Altria’s investments in smoke-free products reflect a strategic focus on diversifying its portfolio. This is in line with shifting preferences away from traditional tobacco products.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/A_stockphoto', 'Healthpeak (NYSE:PEAK) boasts a dividend yield (forward) of\xa07%. Healthpeak’s portfolio performance and leasing activity are vital to its operational edge.', 'The company has shown robust leasing activity and positive spreads across outpatient medical and lab segments. Healthpeak executed leases for large square footage in outpatient medical and lab spaces during Q4 2023. The company leased\xa01.1 million\xa0square feet, with 743K square feet in outpatient medical and 312K square feet in lab spaces. Hence, this leasing activity reflects solid demand for Healthpeak’s properties.', 'Furthermore, Healthpeak attained positive leasing spreads on outpatient medical and lab leases throughout 2023. The company reported a\xa0+4%\xa0cash release spread on outpatient leases and an impressive +23% cash release spread on lab leases. Hence, these positive leasing spreads suggest that Healthpeak could attain higher rental rates upon lease renewals than the previous lease terms.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) provides a near\xa06%\xa0forward dividend yield with a 5-year growth rate of 8%. It is attached to a dividend growth streak of 13 years. KeyCorp’s focus on balance sheet optimization and capital positioning supports its valuation and dividend stability. Due to changes in interest rates and regulatory requirements, the company undertook vital steps to enhance its liquidity and capital adequacy.', 'In this context, KeyCorp strategically reduced its loans by\xa0$7 billion\xa0in 2023. The move aimed to optimize its balance sheet and enhance capital efficiency. This reduction was mainly based on a de-emphasis on credit-only and non-relationship business lines. By reducing loans, KeyCorp aims to prioritize full relationships and higher-quality lending. Additionally, the company decreased its risk-weighted assets (RWAs) by\xa0$14 billion\xa0throughout 2023.

These products contribute to both top-line and gross profit. For instance, smoke-free gross profit increased organically by 19% in 2023. They are outpacing the growth of combustible products. This accelerated growth suggests the growing acceptance and adoption of smoke-free alternatives.', 'ZYN, Philip Morris’ oral smoke-free product, has delivered solid growth, particularly in the U.S. market. The pro forma volumes are up by over\xa060%\xa0for the year and over 75% in Q4 2023.

This consistent focus on cost reduction may continue to boost the company’s competitive edge by improving margins and overall performance.', 'In detail, the company has delivered operational sharpness, particularly in optimizing costs. Also, it is executing commercial initiatives focused on margin and mix improvement. In 2023, the company reduced fixed costs by\xa012%\xa0year-over-year (approximately $500 million).

This suggests that the bank has many deposits available to fund its loan portfolio. It is a critical factor in ensuring edgy operations and facilitating lending activities.

The LCR suggests the bank’s ability to meet its short-term obligations through high-quality liquid assets easily. It has high-quality liquid assets to cover 117% of its net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. This suggests a solid buffer against liquidity risks.', 'Finally, the company’s 156% liquidity coverage of uninsured deposits reflects the bank’s capability to handle unexpected outflows.

This suggests a priority for returning value to shareholders despite adverse conditions in commercial real estate.', 'The annualized dividend growth rate since 2019 is\xa0three times\xa0greater than the largest net lease REIT over the same period. This creates prolonged value expansion potential, as VICI may remain a solid dividend yielder.', 'Moreover, VICI grew considerably in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share earnings in Q3. VICI’s AFFO has a year-over-year increase of\xa010.7%. Similar to dividend growth, the AFFO growth rate outpaces many other REITs. This suggests the company’s operational edge and revenue-generating capabilities.', 'Overall, the consistent growth in AFFO per share reflects VICI’s capability to manage its properties progressively.

If you want to skip detailed analysis of Estate Planning sector, you can go directly to 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.', 'Estate planning has been a practice since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. Then, documents were used to ensure proper inheritance, typically favouring male heirs. The process involved witnesses, signatures, and the creator being of sound mind. Throughout history, various societies have had their own versions of inheritance laws, including references in ancient religious texts.', 'However, in more recent history, the right to estate planning was reserved for a privileged elite, denying access to minority groups like Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Even after legal changes, many communities still lack easy access to education about estate planning. It is essential for underserved populations to have equal opportunities for creating estate plans to protect themselves and their families. Contrary to common belief, estate planning is not just for the wealthy and well-defined group of society but is important for everyone.', 'As of 2024, only 32% of Americans has a will, marking a 6% decline compared to 2023, the first drop in estate planning rates since 2020. The survey by Caring.com revealed that 40% of individuals without a will cited insufficient assets as the reason. Notably, lower-income Americans were twice as likely to mention this, reflecting the disproportionate impact of the economic situation on their decision-making regarding estate planning.', 'Income inequality has played a significant role in estate planning trends, with lower-income households experiencing more vulnerability to inflation and economic challenges. The decrease in estate planning rates is evident across different demographic groups, but young adults aged 18-34 are the only age group that has not experienced a decline since 2020. It is crucial to emphasize that estate planning is essential for everyone, not just the wealthy. Despite 64% of Americans acknowledging the importance of having a will, only 32% have one. This underscores the need for increased awareness and access to estate planning resources for all individuals, regardless of their financial circumstances.', ""The Trusts and Estates sector deals with managing trusts, estates, and agency accounts according to fiduciary agreements for beneficiaries. Revenue in this industry has seen a steady increase over the past five years, mainly driven by gains from assets held in trusts and regular dividends. The industry has benefited from strong performances in equity markets and housing price appreciation during this period. From 2018 to 2023, the industry's revenue has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8%, reaching $221.4 billion, with a projected 4.2% increase in 2023, as per IBIS World. However, we can't guarantee the accuracy of these figures."", 'In the world of estate planning, along with financial and investment planning, it’s essential to look up various big players in the industry, namely, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Hence, before we jump on to discussing 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child, let’s have a look at these companies.', 'Morgan Stanley offers a versatile third-party corporate trustee program. Their estate planning services include a comprehensive suite of fiduciary and trust administration solutions. They conduct thorough due diligence on corporate trustee partners to ensure quality service. Clients can access a variety of discretionary options for trust investment management with a disciplined investment approach.', ""Additionally, clients benefit from the global resources and expertise of Morgan Stanley's investment professionals. Lastly, personalized local service and support are provided by Financial Advisors and Trust Specialists to cater to individual needs."", 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) achieved net revenues of $12.9 billion in the fourth quarter ending on December 31, 2023, slightly higher than the $12.7 billion reported the previous year. The net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.5 billion, equating to $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the corresponding period the previous year.', ""Goldman Sachs' private wealth advisors provide clients with unparalleled resources, access, and guidance to help them maximize their impact and wealth. Each advisor is dedicated to understanding the client's goals and values and curates Goldman Sachs' offerings accordingly. Services include investment advice using a time-tested approach for managing risk and constructing customized portfolios, as well as long-term strategies for trust and estate planning. Clients can request a meeting with Goldman Sachs to explore how these services can assist them in achieving their financial objectives."", 'Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) released its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, reporting net revenues of $46.25 billion and net earnings of $8.52 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, net revenues were $11.32 billion, with net earnings totaling $2.01 billion. The diluted earnings per common share for 2023 stood at $22.87, while for the fourth quarter of 2023, it was $5.48. The return on average common shareholders’ equity was 7.5% for the full year 2023 and an annualized 7.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023.', ""JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) offers personalized estate planning services to help clients achieve their financial goals and ensure their assets are distributed according to their wishes. Their team works closely with clients to evaluate and implement strategies that align with their objectives, whether it involves passing wealth to beneficiaries, caring for loved ones, or supporting charitable causes. By providing guidance on tax-efficient gifting strategies and updating essential documents, such as wills and powers of attorney, J.P. Morgan ensures that clients' estate plans stay current and reflective of their evolving wishes. Clients can engage with J.P. Morgan to create and implement effective estate planning strategies tailored to their unique needs and circumstances."", 'For the quarter ending 31 December 2023, J.P. Morgan reported a 15% decrease in quarterly earnings to $9.31 billion, equivalent to $3.04 per share, compared to the previous year. Adjusted for the fee related to the regional banking crisis and $743 million in investment losses, earnings would have been $3.97 per share, as disclosed by JPMorgan. Revenue increased by 12% to $39.94 billion, slightly surpassing analysts’ projections.', ""A real estate broker pointing to a house model, with the caption 'Real Estate-backed Loans Available.'."", ""To come up with our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child, we conducted an extensive research, relying on various sources to finalize our list. The sources used are namely, Srllp, Vaelderlaw, Wealthify, Due, and Kiplinger. We've ranked the list on discretion."", 'With his, let us now head on towards our list of 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', ""12th one our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child is family business, which is a common asset passed down to children as an inheritance, often with monetary value and a stable income source. This can provide financial security for them in the long term. However, businesses can be unpredictable and may fail if not managed effectively. It's crucial to ensure the business is financially sound and profitable when passing it down. Teaching children how to run the business early on can prepare them for potential future responsibilities."", 'An annuity is a valuable asset to leave for children, offering stable income and potential tax advantages, particularly with non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax funds. By annuitizing the annuity, children can convert it into a reliable income source to cover living expenses for a specified period or lifetime. An annuity helps manage the risk of outliving savings or market downturns. While it provides a stream of income, annuities may have limitations in flexibility and liquidity.', 'Real estate assets, acquired through hard work, can be a valuable inheritance for children, offering financial security and potential growth over time. In addition to safeguarding retirement funds, real estate properties with shared memories can create sentimental value for the heirs. Real estate is a safe investment with potential for growth and can provide financial security for children. However, it may come with maintenance costs and management responsibilities for beneficiaries.', 'A brokerage account, containing stocks and bonds, offers a valuable non-cash financial inheritance that can grow in value over time. These accounts allow for active trading before being transferred to children, who can benefit from the rising asset value gradually. One advantage of brokerage accounts is their divisibility, making it simple to distribute the assets among multiple children. Moreover, stocks are easily liquidated, providing access to cash when needed through the brokerage account.', 'Placing a house into a trust offers several benefits, including asset protection against potential risks like creditors, avoidance of probate for a quicker transfer to beneficiaries, potential tax advantages, and the ability for the settlor to maintain control over asset management. However, there are drawbacks to consider, such as the associated costs of establishing and maintaining a trust, the loss of control once the house is in the trust, the complexity of trust management, and limited flexibility with irrevocable trusts.', ""A spendthrift trust is a type of trust that restricts a beneficiary's access to trust assets based on conditions established by the grantor. This trust structure helps prevent beneficiaries from mismanaging their inheritance and safeguards trust assets from creditors. By disbursing funds incrementally rather than as a lump sum, a spendthrift trust can be beneficial if the beneficiary lacks financial maturity, tends to make impulsive decisions, is in significant debt, vulnerable to deceit, struggling with addiction, has special needs and receives government benefits, facing or anticipating divorce, or works in a litigious industry where asset protection is crucial. The pros of a spendthrift trust include protection from creditors targeting trust assets and a controlled distribution of funds over time."", 'UTMA/UGMA accounts, or Uniform Transfers to Minors/Uniform Gift to Minors accounts are placed 6th on our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child. They\xa0are custodial arrangements that allow gifts to be held for minors who cannot own substantial assets themselves. These accounts enable a designated individual, possibly the donor, to manage the gifted funds until the minor reaches legal age, typically 18 or 21, depending on state laws.', 'Setting up a UTMA/UGMA account is a straightforward process usually done through a local bank branch. However, the funds in the account are taxable to the child, and some investments may trigger tax consequences, potentially subjecting the child to higher tax rates. Consulting with an estate planning attorney is advisable to assess the implications. One concern with UTMA/UGMA accounts is that when the minor reaches the designated age, typically 18 or 21, they gain control of the account and can use the funds as they wish.', 'Click to continue reading and find out about 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.', 'Suggested Articles:', '12 High Growth Real Estate Stocks that are Profitable', 'Top 20 Most Valuable Insurance Companies in the US', '15 States with the Cheapest Home Insurance in the US', 'Disclosure: None.

Last year was supposed to be the year things turned around; instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.', 'Investment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.', 'Some executives even had to walk back their talk of ""green shoots"" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.', ""A lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates at some point this year, and that could hurt the giant banks that were able to charge a lot more for their loans when rates were higher."", '""Loan growth is [a] dog fight right now,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at a Bank of America Securities conference Wednesday, speaking to commercial borrowing usage by his company’s large corporate clients.', 'Mason, the Citigroup CFO, added a note of caution about the M&A pickup.

Its purchase of Discover would create one of the largest US credit card companies and a formidable new rival to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA).', 'Capital One predicts the deal will close in late 2024 or early 2025 if it gets that regulatory approval.', '""We doubt the timing is a coincidence.

Before the election intensifies, remind employees of your core values as a company and stress to everyone—including leaders— the importance of treating people “fairly, with dignity and respect, no matter their choices or affiliations.”', 'The workplace is not an ideal place to have political conversations, says Myers. Nevertheless, politics are embedded in the policies that affect work and daily life, making the polarization that has taken hold in the country hard to escape.

It's led you through top organizations, very important positions. How has education been a through line for you?"", ""James Keyes: It was by far the most important enabler for me. And interestingly, I grew up first generation to attend college. None of my family, brothers, sisters, father, mother, so I had no idea. I was a very typical young person who doesn't really know how or believe that it's possible, and it made all of the difference in the world. That was fortunate enough to go through a four year school college with Holy Cross Massachusetts was able to attend business school at Columbia Graduate School of Business. And it provided a platform really for opportunity and I think that's the big difference. So a lot of question about college today, but what it gave me is breath that gave me so many different doors that I could go through. In fact, gone through many of those doors. [laughs]"", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah and one of them led you to 7-11. Your career there is interesting because you had to deal with so much change so quickly. So you have this phrase that I love in the book, Change Equals Opportunity. I think that's interesting because most of us, when we're hit with change, we go, oh no. As an individual, as an investor, we have this attitude that change isn't going to be good, it's going to be disruptive, it's going to be negative. So how did you embrace change when everything was shifting 7-Eleven."", ""James Keyes: Exactly. Well, it's funny. I woke up one day and said, change equals opportunity effect. It was in the course of writing the book. I said that acronym CEO is really the job of every CEO.[laughs] So it was a wonderful fit. And it also made me realize that growing up I faced a lot of adversity. You know, we all do families or a mess, broken homes and poverty challenges as a kid. And I realized that those things that I had to deal with actually made me stronger and made me more able to deal with change. So when I got to 7-Eleven here, I thought my career was on a fast trajectory. I was with this fabulous company, they were doing great. New York Stock Exchange company. Then they did an LBO. In 1987, the market crashed and they had four billion dollar debt at 17 percent. But interestingly, well, some people would look at that and say, well, this is devastating. I have a young guy, I started my career in the company's bankrupt. They saying it's going to go away. Instead of having my head down. I said, well, what if I got to lose this? I'm going to work harder. We'll come out the other side of this. And it turned out that not only did the company come out better for having to have to restructure with a whole new business plan, et cetera. But I came out better as an individual and an employee of the company with far greater opportunity than I had going into that crisis. So it was really a great lesson for me. Change doesn't mean bad. A lot of times we think it, it's really a response to change rather than the change itself that makes all the difference in the world."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, I think that's so true. I think that's something we all have to learn over time. And I'm interested because at 7-Eleven you learned about this idea of Kaizen from your Japanese business partners. And you've got this story about how this led to a better slope. We all have affection for the slope. Tell us a little bit about this."", ""James Keyes: Well, I was armed with a graduate degree in business and I had all of these skills and I thought I knew basically how to turn around a company from, you know, classic business training. But then I got to Japan and I was astounded at the success of my Japanese partners with 7-Eleven. They had completely transformed the business. We were in the United States having trouble selling a quality hot dog and they were selling fresh sushi delivered three times a day at the store, restaurant quality sushi. I was shocked at that and I started to really try to understand, learn from them what they had done. What were their business principles that helped them be so successful? And it came down to something that I was shocked to learn originated all the way back with Edward Deming, post World War two. An American that was over there trying to help with reconstruction of the country following World War 2. He presented a simple principle called Plan C, or I referred to it as the scientific method. In other words, have a hypothesis. I think this is going to happen. You put an action in place and then you step back and measure it. And then you modify the action to based on the results, based on the data. This is so ridiculously simple. But they took that principle to the nth degree, incorporated in all the virtually all of their business decisions, and created, as a result, a far better business model that came right down to individual products. They would take every individual product, have a hypothesis for how to make it better, put an action in place, put it in front of the customer, measure the results, and then come back and reinvent it. The whole Kaizen concept of continuous improvement they were actually putting in place. So I learned a lot from them about that and I've tried to incorporate it into every business that I've had since."", 'Deidre Woollard: Interesting. I wish we got sushi here at the 7-Eleven. It would be awesome. [laughs]', 'James Keyes: Some day.[laughs]', ""Deidre Woollard: Some day. I hope so. Well, and another thing with 7-Eleven that you talked about in the book, which is the diversity of 7-Eleven franchisees. It's been the butt of joke sometimes, but you also talk about how it's the source, really, of the brand strength. So you really got into learning about those franchisees and what owning a 7-Eleven franchise meant to them. So what lessons did you learn from those franchisees?"", ""James Keyes: I did. It was fascinating. It actually occurred post 911 when we started having some problems, a 7-Eleven because people saw us as majority minority and they saw people behind the counter, and they started taking out their aggression right after 911 with our stores. I tried to understand and began to talk with franchisees about why did you decide on 7-Eleven? I discovered that what they were practicing is the American Dream. They would come here with 500 bucks in a suitcase. And then they would work in a store, save up enough money to buy a franchise, and then turn that into opportunity, bring relatives and put them to work. I began to realize that this is really the strength of 7-Eleven. We ended up with 135 different countries represented. And it taught me a lesson about diversity. In the book, I don't use the word diversity because it's been such a polarizing word lately. It's getting attacked from all directions and really what it comes down to, and my learning from my 7-Eleven franchisees is, it's really cultural literacy. It's understanding other cultures, and recognizing that I have more to learn from them. And if I collect the learnings from all of these different cultures that I have exposure to, I'm going to be a patchwork quilt of their strengths and it's going to make me a better person overall. I've repurposed the idea of diversity into what I call cultural literacy in the book and encourage everybody to pursue that. It was really the lesson that I learned from my own 7-Eleven franchisees."", ""Deidre Woollard: I love that. Well, let's move on, talk a little bit about Blockbuster, because you had this very successful 21 year career at 7-Eleven You come into Blockbuster as CEO at this critical time. What do you think people get wrong about the stories that we tell now about Blockbuster and what really happened?"", ""James Keyes: Well, unfortunately, like everything else, people are looking for the simple answer. So the simple answer is, well, Netflix must have beat Blockbuster and Blockbuster didn't keep up with technology. There is far more learning in the Blockbuster story, if people would dig in and understand it a little bit better. Because really what happened was not Blockbuster's failure to keep up with technology. In fact, people don't even know this. But Blockbuster partnered with Enron in the early 2000, 2004 or something to try to come up with the first streaming video capability. That was way too early. There's a rumor that Netflix tried to offer themselves to Blockbuster that was in the year 2000. That was before streaming was even a thing or even an anyone's radar screen. Really what ultimately happened was Blockbuster spun out of Viacom as an IPO. Viacom used to own the company. They spun them out in the year 2004 with a billion dollars of debt on the balance sheet. No problem. Blockbuster was a cash flow machine, could handle that debt, and they were going on down the road. When I arrived in 2007, first thing I did was to buy a streaming video company called Movie Link. So we were well positioned. We had new releases. Movie Link had 3,000 digitized movies, the largest assortment of anybody in the industry at the time. We renamed that product, Blockbuster on demand. Very well positioned to compete. We doubled Ebita Earnings for interest, tax, depreciation, et cetera. We tripled net in our earnings release for the third quarter of 2008. So you might say, well, what happened? [laughs]"", 'James Keyes: Perfectly well positioned. Well, if you remember what happened in September of 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed. The banking industry basically was on edge, and virtually all lending was shut down. Well, a third of our debt was due in the year 2009. That is the story of Blockbuster, that we were unable to refinance that debt at a reasonable interest rate. We were forced ultimately, into a restructuring of the company, and we sold the company to a strategic partner, Dish Networks.', ""Deidre Woollard: That's fascinating about being ahead of the game with streaming, because I think that happens so often. We see it over and over with products that come out before the audience is ready, and I'm wondering what's going to happen with things like Apple's Vision Pro, is this the right time for it? Is it too early? We don't know."", ""James Keyes: Exactly, and that's the unique thing about technology, and about embracing change, you have to see it coming, you do have to embrace it, but the timing is critical. Really it wasn't that we were too early as much as it was, because we were well positioned, we knew we were early, kids were still basically streaming on their Xbox, TVs weren't smart yet. For a frame of reference, the iPad didn't launch until 2009, so this was very early in the game. But it was really the cash flow, and the lesson here for all businesses is that you remember the old expression, cash is king, well, particularly in a time of crisis, and there's a lesson right now. Because if I go back in my history all the way back to 1987, when I joined 7-Eleven, they ran into the financial market collapse of 1987, and had to restructure the company. Then again, I experienced it in 2008, when interest rates went from 5 or 6% all the way up to 12, for challenge companies or more. Here we are in that same environment today, where companies may have borrowed at 2 or 3%, a few years ago and now all of a sudden they're having to pay 7 or 8%. The lesson is there from the past if you're careful about cash management, you can weather the storm, but that debt can be a killer and cause a company to have to step back and restructure."", ""Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. You were the CEO of 2 big companies, and certainly with Blockbuster, not an easy time. You talk in the book about being tried in the media in relation to the things that the Blockbuster was doing. Some of that was clearly out of your control, but as a CEO, when you're facing that heat, what are some of the challenges of tuning out everyone saying what are you doing and staying focused on what you need to do?"", ""James Keyes: I had an interesting experience. I had started getting calls from my buddies in New York because I didn't take the New York Post living in Dallas, Texas, but the New York Post printed a half page color picture of me with a Pinocchio nose because. It was not a pretty site. The reason they did it is that they had been challenging me about this balance sheet, and we were going to be able to refinance our debt. But Blockbuster had such a cash flow advantage that I really didn't anticipate filing for Chapter 11 for restructuring. Well, we put out a 10K and we gave the warning that that could happen, and certainly when Moody's gave us an increase in our debt rating, but declared us a potential default risk, the New York Post went crazy with it and said, blockbusted was the headline, I believe. I know it was brutal. But the learning from that really, and from all of the false information about Blockbuster, and people assuming that Netflix crushed the company, etc. You realize it's not personal, it's business, and it's such an important learning because confidence is critically important for a leader in any environment that they can't take these things personally. It's going to happen and you're going to get attacked from all sides at times. But if you know you're doing the right thing, and if you have the confidence to continue leading and doing the right thing, then you can recognize this isn't personal, it's just business, and sometimes there are motives that people have behind these attacks that they're making, and you recognize that and you move on."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to get your take on AI because I've been talking to people about it for a while, and one of the things that I've heard from younger people is that traditional education isn't necessarily working for them anymore. Partly because they're like, why do I have to stuff my brain with all of this stuff if the computer can do it faster and better? How are you thinking about AI and how it relates to traditional education?"", ""James Keyes: I am super excited about AI. As you can tell I'm excited about technology in general. When Star Link lights up entire continents like Africa, and enables technology to provide learning in places that we could never even get books to historically. The opportunity is amazing and you look at AI and again, there's a lot of fear and probably natural, but we should be cautious about these new technologies. But think about the good that AI can do. We have taught in school the same way for 100 years, blackboards books. Teacher standing in front of the class, standardized test, bell curve, and a lot of people that doesn't fit, and with AI, we have the opportunity to tailor, literally, curate that lesson to the way somebody learns. Some of us learn better with videos, we can curate that training to have them watch videos, and others respond better to the written word, others to a teacher, or a professor. We can find the best algebra professor in the world and pipe them into the classroom, so the teacher then becomes almost a concierge to let someone who really knows how to teach, teach. Then we measure the performance of the students in the best way they learn based on their results. We can keep modifying and keep improving, so think about, this is not artificial intelligence, this is maximizing human intelligence, it's doing the same thing. It's not machine learning, it's human learning, and improving human learning over and over again by using the technology to enable it."", ""Deidre Woollard: But one of the things I worry about with technology though is, we've seen since the pandemic students have done worse because of remote learning, so what do you think about how we still bring in that human connection so that people are still taking in the information?"", ""James Keyes: Again, I'm not worried about it because I did a lot of work on digital learning during the pandemic, and I was excited about it because we moved forward as much as 20 years in providing access to digital learning, just by lighting up cities with Wi-Fi capabilities, and hot spots, and giving kids laptops, etc. What we are is in the early stages, it's almost like the early stages of digital streaming. It was a horrible experience, and everybody said, this is never going to work. Not true. Technology will over time integrate the platforms, make them better, here's some examples, linked in learning. It's a wonderful thing, but it basically takes textbooks, and turns them into video digital. Well, with the next generation, you'll be able to, instead of showing a biology class, you'll be able to take somebody into an operating room, and watch a live operation going on. That's a whole different level of learning. The best example I can give you is, all the kids that hated digital learning would put away their homework and then play video games for 8 hours. Why? It was engaging and the graphics were eye popping. Another really important difference, they had incentives, so why not provide incentives? In fact, I'm working on a thing, it's like micro finance, but micro scholarships. Instead of giving kids scholarships at the end, we should be working on incentifying them up front. I have encouraged friends and friends children to use Khan Academy to learn math, but Khan Academy is a little dull. But if every time you pass the test, you get 20 cents for it by American Airlines, because they want people to learn math and science, then you might have the incentive and have more fun doing it and staying in, and engaged in those programs. Again, it's early, the technology is going to bring these things that improve engagement, so I am super confident that we're going to find education is transformed in the same way that we've transformed retail with Amazon, or automobiles with Tesla. We're going to find when education works its magic on teaching and learning phenomenal what can occur."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Ricky Mulvey, thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow."", ""Deidre Woollard has positions in Apple. Ricky Mulvey has positions in Netflix.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PSX.', ""On February 21, 2024, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, released its annual 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic direction. As of December 31, 2023, Phillips 66 has demonstrated a solid financial position, with a diversified portfolio that includes refining, midstream, chemicals, and marketing and specialties segments. The company's financial tables reveal a strategic emphasis on optimizing its asset base, enhancing its marketing network, and expanding into renewable energy sources. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the recent 10-K filing, offering investors a detailed perspective on Phillips 66's market position and future outlook."", ""Refining and Marketing Prowess: Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) stands out in the refining industry with a capacity of 1.9 million barrels per day, bolstered by strategic marketing operations. The company's ability to efficiently market both branded and unbranded petroleum products, particularly in key regions like the Midcontinent, Rockies, and West Coast, underscores its competitive edge. The acquisition of a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast to optimize renewable diesel placement further exemplifies its strategic agility. Phillips 66's marketing network, which includes approximately 1,390 brand-licensing agreements, ensures consistent product placement and refinery throughput, contributing to its robust financial performance."", ""Investment in Renewable Energy: The transition of the Rodeo, California, facility to produce renewable diesel by 2023 reflects Phillips 66's commitment to sustainability and positions the company at the forefront of the energy transition. This move not only diversifies the company's product portfolio but also aligns with global trends towards cleaner energy sources. The renewable diesel production is expected to cater to the increasing demand for lower-carbon fuels, providing Phillips 66 with a long-term competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving energy landscape."", ""Exposure to Market Volatility: Like others in the industry, Phillips 66's earnings and cash flows are significantly impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, margins, and demand for refined petroleum products. The company's reliance on purchasing feedstocks exposes it to fluctuations in crude oil prices and refined product markets, which can adversely affect refining margins and profitability. Despite its strong marketing and refining capabilities, this inherent industry risk remains a persistent challenge for Phillips 66, necessitating effective risk management strategies to mitigate its impact."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Pressures: Phillips 66 operates in a highly regulated environment, with stringent environmental laws and regulations that necessitate substantial compliance expenditures. The company's operations and capital expenditures are materially affected by environmental regulations, including those related to climate change and plastic waste. As societal and political concerns around these issues intensify, Phillips 66 may face increased litigation, operational disruptions, and higher costs, potentially impacting its financial condition and competitive position."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Phillips 66's recent acquisition on the U.S. West Coast to support renewable diesel marketing exemplifies its proactive approach to strategic growth. The company's ability to identify and capitalize on synergistic opportunities can enhance its market presence and product offerings. Additionally, partnerships and joint ventures, such as those in the midstream segment, provide avenues for expanding its transportation and NGL processing assets, further solidifying its industry standing."", ""Advancements in Energy Research and Innovation: The company's Energy Research & Innovation organization is a testament to its commitment to technological advancement and future energy solutions. With a focus on feedstock characterization, renewables processing, and process optimization, Phillips 66 is well-positioned to enhance its refining margins and reliability. Continued investment in research and development can lead to breakthroughs that not only improve operational efficiency but also create new revenue streams in a transitioning energy market."", ""Global Economic and Geopolitical Risks: Phillips 66's international operations expose it to global economic uncertainties and geopolitical risks that can disrupt supply chains and affect commodity prices. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the potential for significant adverse impacts on demand for the company's products. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and conflicts can lead to volatility in crude oil markets, posing a threat to the stability of Phillips 66's operations and financial results."", 'Intensifying Competition: The refining and marketing sectors are highly competitive, with companies vying for feedstock supplies and product markets. Competitors with their own crude production or more extensive retail networks may have a competitive advantage during periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. Phillips 66 must continuously innovate and optimize its operations to maintain its market position against competitors with greater financial resources or integrated operations.', 'In conclusion, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) exhibits significant strengths in its refining capacity, strategic marketing initiatives, and investments in renewable energy. However, the company must navigate the inherent weaknesses of market volatility and regulatory pressures. Opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions and advancements in energy research are promising, while global economic uncertainties and intense competition present ongoing threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Phillips 66 is poised to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats in the dynamic energy landscape.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +24.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $16.19 billion, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.27% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX?', ""For TJX, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.54%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TJX would post earnings of $0.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.03, delivering a surprise of +6.19%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'TJX appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The reference point for mineral reserves is the point of delivery to the process plant. Metal price assumptions, adjusted for Newmont's exchange rate assumption, are based on considering such factors as market forecasts, industry consensus and management estimates. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralization considered economic to process, varies between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available. Reserve estimates may have non-material differences in comparison to our joint venture partners due to differences in classification and rounding methodology."", 'The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum will be realized. Ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper, lead, zinc or molybdenum included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.', 'The measured, indicated, and inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves.

The term ""economically,"" as used in this definition, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in at a minimum, a pre-feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term ""legally,"" as used in this definition, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont (or our joint venture partners) must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s (or our joint venture partners\') current mine plans. Reserves in this presentation are aggregated from the proven and probable classes. The term ""Proven reserves"" used in the tables of the appendix means reserves for which (a) quantity is estimated from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are estimated from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term ""Probable reserves"" means reserves for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for Proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for Proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates. Proven and Probable reserves include gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead, molybdenum or tungsten attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest. Proven and Probable reserves were calculated using cut-off grades. The term ""cutoff grade"" means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead, molybdenum or tungsten extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.', 'Estimates of Proven and Probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, molybdenum and tungsten and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised using significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper, lead, molybdenum and tungsten prices as a result of a decrease in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges. Producers use pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change. Estimates of resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of all of the Inferred resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves. In addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, molybdenum or tungsten declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves or resources have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired. For additional information see the ""Proven and Probable Reserve"" and ""Measured and Indicated and Inferred Resource"" tables herein.', 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements:', 'This release may contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.

The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies around the world and a regulatory organization.', 'AISC is a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. We believe that AISC is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.', 'AISC amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in IFRS, or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company’s internal policies.', 'The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the All-In Sustaining Costs measure:', ""Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from CAS, such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals. The other metals' CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period."", 'Reclamation costs.

Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals.', 'Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at Corporate and Other using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.', 'General and administrative.

Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss).

The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company’s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations.

Our actual audited consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 are expected to be reported in connection with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is expected to be filed on or about February 27, 2024. Our actual consolidated financial results may differ from the results included in this release, including as a result of audit adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and when the Form 10-K is finalized and filed. This release should not be viewed as a substitute for audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on this release, which has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management.', 'Notice Regarding Reserve and Resource:', 'The reserves stated herein were prepared in compliance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC and represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum estimated, at December 31, 2023, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term ""economically,"" as used in this definition, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in at a minimum, a pre-feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term ""legally,"" as used in this definition, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont (or our joint venture partners) must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s (or our joint venture partner’s) current mine plans. Reserves in this presentation are aggregated from the proven and probable classes. The term ""Proven reserves"" used in the tables of the appendix means reserves for which (a) quantity is estimated from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are estimated from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term ""Probable reserves"" means reserves for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for Proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for Proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates. Proven and Probable reserves include gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead or molybdenum attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest. Proven and Probable reserves were calculated using cut-off grades. The term ""cutoff grade"" means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead or molybdenum extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.', 'Estimates of Proven and Probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised using significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper, lead and molybdenum prices as a result of a decrease in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges. Producers use pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.', 'Estimates of resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of all of the Inferred resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves. In addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead or molybdenum declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves or resources have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.

168,8e044298-674c-36a3-a5f0-1153a7e7ead6,NEE,2024-02-22,2 No-Brainer Utility Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8e044298-674c-36a3-a5f0-1153a7e7ead6/2-no-brainer-utility-stocks.html,1708597200,STORY,"['NEE', 'BKH']","[""Building and maintaining power plants is expensive, which is why utilities often carry a lot of debt. That's been a problem on Wall Street because investors are worried that the swift rise in interest rates will dent utility earnings. Thus, the utility sector has been out of favor. That's great news for long-term investors, even if all you have to invest is $500, because you can buy great companies at reasonable -- if not cheap -- prices."", ""The list includes utility giant NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and relatively small Black Hills (NYSE: BKH), which happens to be a Dividend King. Here's what you need to know about these two utility stocks."", ""The core of NextEra Energy's business is Florida Power & Light, the largest electric utility in the Sunshine State. This has been a very good region in which to operate because of the long-term migration patterns toward warmer climates, which has resulted in an increased customer base. Simply put, more customers means more revenue."", ""However, the really interesting story here isn't the company's regulated electric utility operations. What sets NextEra apart from its peers is its massive clean energy business, which is among the largest in the world. This has been a long-term growth engine. That shows up most compellingly in the dividend, which has been increased at an annualized rate of 10% for a decade. Half of that rate would be considered very good for a utility. The company expects 10% dividend growth in 2024 and continued solid earnings expansion through at least 2026."", ""The problem with NextEra is that investors are well aware that its mix of regulated assets and clean energy growth is producing strong results. The shares are usually afforded a premium valuation. But given the rise in interest rates, NextEra's stock has pulled back. The 3.6% dividend yield on offer today is only average for a utility, but it is near the highest levels of the past decade for NextEra Energy. In other words, this strong performer looks like it is on sale."", ""There's another impressive thing about the $117 billion market cap of NextEra Energy: It has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years. Black Hills is a way smaller company, with a market cap of just $3.5 billion. However, Black Hills has boosted its dividend annually for 53 consecutive years. That's right, this tiny little utility is a highly elite Dividend King, which kind of puts it on a plateau above NextEra in some ways."", ""But like NextEra, investors are worried about the impact of higher rates. So Black Hills' roughly 5% yield is near decade highs as well, suggesting that it is also on sale today."", 'Black Hills operates in parts of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming, serving roughly 1.3 million natural gas and electric utility customers. While that may sound less attractive than Florida, the regions in which Black Hills operates have actually seen customer growth that is nearly three times faster than U.S. population expansion. Higher interest rates are likely to be a headwind, but given the strong underlying business, Black Hills should muddle through just fine despite its diminutive size and continue to reward dividend investors all along the way.', 'The big takeaway here is that dividend growth investors have an opportunity to buy a strong utility in giant NextEra Energy. Investors looking for a reliable high yield have an opportunity to buy a strong utility in tiny Black Hills. Both can be had for less than $500 a share, so you can buy these two stocks even if you are starting with a modest amount of cash.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the electric utility industry, head directly to 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Right Now.\xa0', 'In the face of a continuously changing energy landscape, US utilities maintain three primary objectives according to Ernst & Young (EY) – ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. The utilities sector in 2024 requires a careful balance between conventional and innovative funding approaches to advance these priorities. Presently, utility executives are better equipped than ever to decisively navigate the transformative decisions required for the future. Initial focus should be on three primary opportunities – (1) Strengthening the balance sheet to support investment strategies that generate enduring value for stakeholders, (2) Optimizing newly accessible capital, such as grants and tax credits, to expedite the energy transition for power and utility companies, and (3) Upgrading technology to advance business operations.', 'In 2023, the US power and utilities industry experienced advancements in decarbonization, increased deployment of solar power and energy storage, and improved grid reliability. As per a recent Deloitte report, the sector faced mixed fundamentals, with a slight decrease in electricity sales due to mild weather. Wholesale electricity prices dropped in response to lower natural gas costs, but high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, coupled with rising interest rates, contributed to potential customer bill increases. The industry also grappled with costs related to disaster recovery, cybersecurity, and climate-related challenges. Despite lower fuel costs, retail electricity prices were projected to increase by 1.9% year-over-year, with residential prices potentially rising by 4.7%. In 2024, electricity prices are expected to stabilize, with a forecasted 2% increase in sales. The industry may focus on electrification, resource adequacy, and addressing rising costs, exploring the potential use of AI, including generative AI, to tackle challenges.\xa0', ""In 2023, utilities faced a decline as investor preference shifted from defensive stocks to mega-cap growth companies, particularly in the technology and communication services sectors. This led to utilities being one of the weakest-performing sectors in the S&P 500. However, by late 2023, utilities stocks experienced significantly lower valuations, trading at one of the largest discounts to the S&P in the past two decades, according to a Fidelity report. The utility sector's near-term performance may continue to be influenced by investor sentiment and economic conditions in 2024. If the economy maintains a soft landing with strong growth and low inflation, utilities may remain out of favor. Conversely, in the face of economic weakness, investors could turn back to defensive stocks like utilities, known for stability, durable cash flows, and dividends, especially during market volatility. A decline in interest rates could further benefit utility stocks by making their dividends more attractive compared to bonds. "", 'Looking at the longer term, utilities are positioned at the center of the shift from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to accelerate this transition by providing incentives for the adoption of clean-energy options and reducing greenhouse gasses. Consumers, businesses, and governments are actively working to decrease their carbon footprints, and forecasts suggest a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'Some of the best electric utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

If you want to skip our introduction covering how without the semiconductor industry, and how it's essential to the development of artificial intelligence, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom. "", ""Earlier this year, OpenAI's co founder and chief executive officer Sam Altman demonstrated his ability to remain in the news after he estimated that the total funding required to build an independent supply chain of semiconductors to fund all possible use cases for artificial intelligence could require $7 trillion in capital. Altman's talk with investors in the UAE reported by the Wall Street Journal involved his vision of a massive boost to global chip making foundries, energy, data centers, and other infrastructure required to sustain the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to fund artificial intelligence applications all over the world."", ""While $7 trillion is more money than the annual economic output, or the GDP, of several countries, similar figures have been common in the semiconductor industry these past couple of months. In fact, it was semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang who stated during the firm's earnings call for the second quarter of its previous fiscal year:"", 'The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We’re seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it’s the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you’re seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.', ""Huang and Altman's comments show that at least when some of the most influential persons in the high computing and semiconductor design industries are concerned, the global semiconductor industry can grow by the trillions of dollars."", ""In fact, on the day that Huang made the comments, NVIDIA's shares were trading in the $450 - $460 range, and had you believed him when he'd said that artificial intelligence and the broader advances in data center computing carry the potential to take his firm to new financial heights and bought NVIDIA's stock, then your investment would have delivered a price appreciation of roughly 45%."", ""Quite impressive, but given that NVIDIA's stock is up by 230% over the past year, it does make one wonder where the rest of this growth comes from. Well, after its earnings press release for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 hit the wires, NVIDIA's shares gained 27% over the next couple of days. This was the first true surge in the semiconductor stock that is at the top of the food chain when we talk about artificial intelligence. Why did the shares jump more this time? Well, the press release saw Huang throw around the trillion dollar estimate for the first time."", ""However, Huang and Altman are not the only semiconductor executives who have commented on artificial intelligence. In fact, since it's now become a major global phenomenon, managements of other semiconductor stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) have all weighed in. AMD's Su, whose firm is the only direct competitor to NVIDIA's products in non-Arm based GPU designs, believes that the artificial intelligence data center computing products market was worth $45 billion in 2023. Her remarks, made in December also shared the Santa Clara, California based chip designer's estimates that by 2027 end, this market will have grown to $400 billion."", 'Similarly, semiconductor stock TSMC\'s management confirmed that it had ""witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications"" in 2023. Likewise, Intel chief Patrick Gelsinger shared during the earnings call in January 2024 that not only had his firm witnessed ""the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030, but that Intel is the only company ""able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""The final bit of Gelsinger's comments is particularly important when we talk about semiconductor stocks that could benefit from AI-related tailwinds. This is because while chip stocks such as NASDAQ:NVDA, NASDAQ:INTC, NASDAQ:AMD, and NYSE:TSM are direct beneficiaries of the growth in AI, others like Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) can also benefit from booming AI demand as their products are indispensable when it comes to designing chips."", ""Today, we'll talk about some such semiconductor stocks that hedge funds are buying in the era of artificial intelligence."", 'Close-up of a robotic endoluminal surgery device performing a procedure in an operating room.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we ranked semiconductor stocks that are directly or indirectly exposed to artificial intelligence by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

The shares are rated Buy on average, and the average analyst share price target is $206.', ""During last year's fourth quarter, 62 out of the 944 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned Analog Devices, Inc.

The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share.', 'Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results.', 'Chkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: ""Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.""', 'Speaking to Nvidia\'s dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: ""I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter."" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: ""The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don\'t know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who\'s kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let\'s say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk to one analyst who's watching these numbers closely. That is Antoine Chkaiban, who is New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst. Antoine, what do you make of these numbers as we just get them? It looks like a beat here but not the astonishing beats perhaps that we have had in some recent quarters."", ""ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: Yes. Thanks, Julie, for having me. So Nvidia just printed 4Q topline, up 22% sequentially. That's 8% above sell side consensus expectations on top line, with data center revenues 27% above, and guided 1Q topline 9% sequentially, 8% above consensus expectations. And the stock has been moving a lot after market."", ""This clearly illustrates that buy side expectations were above sell side. And also, remember that this has to be put in context of a very strong acceleration in the past couple of quarters. Nvidia's topline had already grown 2 and 1/2x in 3Q compared to 1Q, as companies like Microsoft and Meta accelerate the deployment of their AI infrastructure."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Antoine, I'm curious on the call here coming up with Jensen Huang as well as, of course, the CFO, what's your number one question, Antoine, for those executives?"", ""ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think just looking at the numbers in the press release, indeed, doesn't give us any indication on where we're headed. We're still very early in the broader deployment of AI. Demand is very strong at the moment. Supply is tight. And hopefully, Nvidia will give qualitative color on the call."", ""The company made comments last quarter suggesting that visibility now extends in 2025 with inference picking up. That's the kind of color that we'll be on the lookout for."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And I'm also curious what kind of trajectory you're looking for for the generative AI cycle, I guess, even though it feels still like we're very early. There was another analyst who talked about a replacement cycle of these GPU-- these Nvidia-provided GPU chips that could be as much a high percentage as 50% to 60% of chips from, I guess, around 10% right now. Does that-- I mean, you know, what are the estimates out there for how big this could eventually be?"", 'ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: But if we take a step a step back on all this, global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of 400 billion in 2027.', 'And so now we just need to think about the future along two axes, either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction with disappointments over investments and lower returns.', ""And we really see three possible scenarios from here. First of all, if AMD's $400 billion in 2027 case materializes, well, Nvidia is still amongst the highest quality names to invest today. $400 billion spent on AI chips likely means at least $300 billion on GPUs. And Nvidia, the undisputable leader in this market, could generate $65 of EPS in 2027. That's more than two times above consensus. And that makes plenty of room for the stock to keep trending up."", ""And then another scenario could be for AI to cool off and say only half of AMD's projection materializes. $200 billion spent on chips in 2027 means maybe $150 billion on GPUs. And Nvidia would generate closer to $30 of EPS, which is what consensus is currently modeling. Such a scenario would therefore make less room for upside as it's already priced into the stock."", ""And lastly, if AI adoption plays out much more slowly than what people currently expect, well, we could simply reach a peak in 2025 and realize that use cases are not mature enough to drive adoption. Spending would pull back in 2026, 2027, as the industry digests the chips deployed. And that is what we call an AI winter. And it's in such a scenario Nvidia would miss expectations and the stock would pull back."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Antoine, stay right there. I want to bring in another-- another very smart analyst to give his commentary. Dan Morgan, Synovus Portfolio Manager, joins us now. Dan, it is great to have you in the conversation. We should mention, Dan, initially this stock in the after hours had dropped about 4%. You are now popping almost now above 6.5%. So investors digesting this and now initially at least seem to be responding very positively. Dan, want to get first your reaction and your response, Dan, to this report.', ""DAN MORGAN: Well, Josh to me it looks like a beat across the board. I mean, the big numbers I was focusing on was data center in terms of revenues. They beat that handily. And then of, course, that upcoming first quarter of '25 revenue number, I think the Street was a little over $21 billion, that came in over $24 billion. So again, it really-- there is very hard to find any flaws in this report."", ""You know, Julie, Josh, coming into this I was worried that maybe even if they beat on the fourth quarter and guided ahead on the first quarter of '25, it still wouldn't be enough. So I'm encouraged that they are reacting positively to the stock. We had a big sell off, as you know, coming to this report. A lot of it is related to the Palo Alto Networks warning that we got last night that kind of rolled into the Nvidia number and Nvidia stock price. But it appears that we're getting some clear thought here on going forward with Nvidia. And it looks all positive."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Just one thing I wanted to draw our viewers attention to that I've noticed in the CFO commentary from Colette Kress over at Nvidia, she mentioned that data center sales to China declined significantly in the fourth quarter due to US government licensing requirements. Now, that's not a surprise, right? We know that Nvidia is trying to figure out some workarounds for China."", ""But, Antoine, I'll take this question back to you. How much of an obstacle still is China? And do you expect China to continue to? Will it get worse?"", ""ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think in the guidance actually for the quarter that Nvidia just reported, there were no data center revenues. Nvidia guided for very minimal data center revenues this quarter. And the way we see things playing out going forward is that demand is so strong everywhere in the world that chips that would have been allocated to China can definitely be reallocated to other countries to demand elsewhere. So we don't really see that weighting much on data center growth going forward."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Dan, I want to bring you back here as well. I should mention, Dan, we think of Nvidia now as kind of an AI proxy, so maybe it's no surprise here, Dan. I'm looking at a few different names here moving higher, maybe in symphony, Supermicro, AMD, ARM, Palantir moving higher here in the after hours as well."", ""One question I had for you, Dan, was on the question of competition, you know, in Gen AI Silicone. When you think of competition-- I guess I'll double barrel for you, Dan. One, what are, in your opinion, Nvidia's kind of competitive advantages? And two, who you think poses the greatest competitive risk? Is it AMD, Intel, or another player?"", ""DAN MORGAN: Yeah, Josh. So I think we have to think of Nvidia as kind of first to market in AI. I mean, they have been talking about on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in this space. And then all of a sudden, it came to fruition about a year ago on this quarter. And they had the big blowout quarter. So they've got that lead post in terms of ahead of a lot of the competition."", ""But you're right, Josh. I mean, I've done a lot of work in putting together tables and so forth of what are some of these competing chips. I mean, you have AMD which you mentioned. They have the MI300X, MI300A, which they have, rolling out right now in that space. You also have Intel with Falcon Shores, GOTY 3, which is another chip that's going to be coming out the next year or two."", ""You look at Marvel Technologies. Their PAM4 DSP processor is also in that space. But there's no doubt that NVIDIA has that lead ahead of a lot of these other companies who are just now starting to roll out competing AI chips. So because of that, they're-- probably stay in the lead."", ""But think about this, Josh. The average AI chip that NVIDIA sells-- we don't know the exact price. But some of them are like, $20,000 or $30,000 a piece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD, who's kind of known as being a lower priced chip maker, especially in the CPU area against Intel, or let's say in the data server space, would they come in to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with? So that's where I kind of see the door maybe opening up for maybe an AMD or some other competing company, like a Marvel or something like that."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean, Qualcomm has already also come out with some chips that it says are very speedy in the AI realm for smartphones. And I wonder-- part of what NVIDIA has done was, to some extent, commoditize what has been historically, at least, a commodity business, right, when you're talking about semiconductors and still is that way in many sectors of the business. Antoine, do we get to a point where even these AI chips are commoditized, where you see a price war that gets kicked off by an NVIDIA competitor, for example?"", ""ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: I think creating, designing an AI chip is easier said than done. It requires so much R&D, so much experience to create a chip that's as flexible as an NVIDIA GPU today where you have compute units speaking to a hierarchy of memory that is so complicated so you can move data around without keeping parts of the chips that-- a chip that is very expensive, that costs $20,000, if not more, keeping all the parts of the chip busy at every point in time. It takes a lot of experience. It takes a lot of R&D."", ""The ecosystem that NVIDIA has built, as well, all the software stack, all the ecosystem resources, the developers that can help each other-- that is not something that can be created overnight by a competing ecosystem, by another company. So I really don't think that we're headed towards a commodity market here. On the contrary, if anything, ecosystem dynamics will drive concentration."", 'If we go back to this $400 billion time that AMD alluded to, we see GPUs accounting for at least 75% of that market because of the flexibility that they offer. And then we see NVIDIA remaining dominant within that $300 billion market if it materializes.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And I think Antoine brings up a good point, Dan, as well, about the sort of-- it's not just the chip that NVIDIA makes. It has the software. It has that-- what he called the ecosystem. So then do you play it not just by trying to find out who the competitors are going to be, but who are the service providers for NVIDIA, who is working with them to help them produce that ecosystem?"", ""DAN MORGAN: Yeah. I think what Antoine's alluding to is, Julie, is that NVIDIA has their own proprietary software that they sell along with their chips. Kind of going back to maybe issues in terms of possible threats that we could look at from an NVIDIA, especially the data center, it's projected about 65% of their revenue comes from data center AI chips."", ""We know that-- companies just recently announced in the last couple of days. We know that Amazon, we know that Microsoft, we know that Alphabet, Meta are all working on their own AI chips to use in their own systems, which would take away that reliance that they would have on, let's say, an NVIDIA and maybe their willingness to spend $20,000 on a chip. So that's another interesting thing, Julie, to think about."", ""We think about the competition from AMD and Intel and Broadcom and Marvel. But it could be from the actual buyers that use the chip. They start developing their own interior proprietary chip, kind of like what Apple's done with the Mac and has moved over with their phones. They have their own chips now opposed to relying on outside vendors. So that's kind of something interesting to think about."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Antoine, I'll get you out of here on this. I see the stock-- it is surging here in the after hours, up over 6%. One question I had for you, Antoine, is as you think about as a financial analyst, when you think about NVIDIA in the quarters, years ahead, is it going to be a kind of and bust company, Antoine, or No you think the kind of growth we're seeing here, which is obviously really impressing investors in the Street-- it can actually continue?"", ""ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: Well, we have been very, very busy over the last few months thinking about that question and putting together a framework to help us predict towards which scenario we're headed. You remember I just mentioned we could be headed towards a $400 billion scenario. We could be headed towards an AI winter. And I think we'll be monitoring four parameters to determine where we're headed."", ""First of all, we'll be monitoring how quickly model complexity is increasing. GPT-4 is likely five times larger than GPT-3. And we have been on this trend for many years now that's driving demand for more compute."", ""Then you have cheap efficiency that's increasing, as well, of course. H100's throughput is six times higher than A100. And Moore's law and design improvements will keep driving higher throughput. That is offsetting model complexity increasing."", ""And then you have usage, of course, users and the time that each user spends on ChatGPT, Gemini, et cetera. That is driving demand for more chips. And so this is what we'll be monitoring in coming years. This is how we can add value for investors, by carefully tracking how these three parameters-- model complexity, chip efficiency, and usage-- are growing. We can determine how much the AI install base needs to grow and how much the world will have to spend to build it. Those are really the leading indicators to determine if we're headed towards an AI winter or not."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Dan and Antoine, I have one final question that I want to ask both of you. Dan, I'll start with you. Right now, the stock is up. Obviously, it could do whatever in the next 24 hours. If it continues to rise, is it too late for investors, Dan, to get in here?"", ""DAN MORGAN: Julie, we've had NVIDIA on our buy list for a pretty long period of time, way before it became the hottest stock ever. And for investors that would possibly come in with new monies, it's on their buy list if the risk tolerance and the objective matches."", ""The stock trades at about 83 times trailing earnings, trades about 35 times fiscal year 2025 earnings. So it's not excessive, Julie, when we look at the forward multiple. And I still think there's room to grow. I mean, I'm going to write a piece of our upcoming newsletter this month that talks about is NVIDIA the next Microsoft and Apple, meaning those two stocks have eclipsed $3 trillion. Microsoft just got over the fence."", ""Could NVIDIA be the next $3 trillion stock-- so still very optimistic and very bullish. And I still think there's plenty of opportunity for investors. Obviously, try to catch it on a weaker day. But it's still-- fundamentals are still intact going forward. There's really nothing, I believe, to derail the story at this point."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Antoine, do you agree?', 'ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think I agree that there is still upside. I definitely think that there is still room for the stock to keep going up. And so I join Dan on this one.', ""But I also think that there is probably more upside in other names, like AMD, for example. AMD probably has the most attractive profile, actually, with the most upside if this $400 billion time plays out because the market is going to grow so much. And AMD's revenues today in that time is-- are very small. And so there's plenty of room for AMD to beat expectations even more than NVIDIA."", ""I also think other names, like TSMC, Intel, and Micron, probably offer less upside than AMD. But they're also a better way to play this with a safer approach. Even if the high case doesn't materialize, there is still upside in an AI winter scenario."", 'So we look really at this space more holistically. And we think NVIDIA is one of the ways. But there are many other ways to play this trend.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Gentlemen, thank you so much-- really great to have you on and get your insight instantly after these numbers. Dan Morgan and Antoine Chkaiban, thank you so much.']"

You can skip our detailed analysis on the technological advancements in this segment of military warfare and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.', 'The wars between Azerbaijan and Armenia first in 2020, and then later involving Russia and Ukraine have been the kind of conflicts that western powers had been worrying about, and are now scrambling to prepare themselves for a future that already seems to be here. Demand for military drones have surged over the last few years with countries actively using their unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target operations.', 'Drones were a prominent feature of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and have been clouding the skies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Borodyanka among other towns and cities in Ukraine, in what is being seen as the arrival of a new threat in the aerial defense space. These uninhabited aerial vehicles have made it difficult for enemy targets to move and hide on the battlefield with their aerial footages offering unprecedented birds-eye views of the war.', 'The Americans have been operating drones for about a century now, having deployed them first during World War II, between 1939 and 1945, and then more recently in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. Defense experts believe the proliferation of military drones is a concern for US policymakers who worry about China taking a leaf out of Russia’s book (strikes on Ukraine), and launching similar attacks against US interests in the Pacific. Moreover, US troops have also come under drone attacks from non-state actors in the Middle East in recent years – most notably from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.', 'Considering the rapidly evolving threat, the Americans are taking initiatives to stay a step ahead of their foes. In August 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced to build ‘attritable autonomous systems’ in mass over the next two years. Moreover, under the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the US Air Force plans to develop drone wingmen to fly alongside its premier fighter and bomber jets – Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)’s B-21 Raider.', 'These unmanned combat air vehicles will be used to perform several missions, such as surveillance, striking enemies and jamming their signals. The Air Force expects about a thousand CCAs to enter service by 2028, which will mean that they would be ready for deployment with the sixth-generation of fighter jets that are currently being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.', 'According to a report, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and General Atomics, are all vying for contracts for the classified CCA initiative.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s RQ-170 Sentinel was introduced in 2007, and is operated by the Air Force for CIA missions. On the other hand, the MQ-9 Reaper built by General Atomics is one of the most potent drones operated by the US, and serves as the primary offensive strike uninhabited aerial vehicle of the Air Force.', 'The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently overseeing the development of the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which will become the first unmanned aerial refueling vehicle that will be carrier-based and will extend the range of the US Navy’s aircraft carriers. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $805 million contract in 2018 for four MQ-25 Stingrays to be delivered by August 2024.', 'Another prominent defense contractor that builds unmanned aerial vehicles in the US is AeroVironment, Inc.

If you want to skip our discussion on the electric utility industry, head directly to 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Right Now.\xa0', 'In the face of a continuously changing energy landscape, US utilities maintain three primary objectives according to Ernst & Young (EY) – ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. The utilities sector in 2024 requires a careful balance between conventional and innovative funding approaches to advance these priorities. Presently, utility executives are better equipped than ever to decisively navigate the transformative decisions required for the future. Initial focus should be on three primary opportunities – (1) Strengthening the balance sheet to support investment strategies that generate enduring value for stakeholders, (2) Optimizing newly accessible capital, such as grants and tax credits, to expedite the energy transition for power and utility companies, and (3) Upgrading technology to advance business operations.', 'In 2023, the US power and utilities industry experienced advancements in decarbonization, increased deployment of solar power and energy storage, and improved grid reliability. As per a recent Deloitte report, the sector faced mixed fundamentals, with a slight decrease in electricity sales due to mild weather. Wholesale electricity prices dropped in response to lower natural gas costs, but high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, coupled with rising interest rates, contributed to potential customer bill increases. The industry also grappled with costs related to disaster recovery, cybersecurity, and climate-related challenges. Despite lower fuel costs, retail electricity prices were projected to increase by 1.9% year-over-year, with residential prices potentially rising by 4.7%. In 2024, electricity prices are expected to stabilize, with a forecasted 2% increase in sales. The industry may focus on electrification, resource adequacy, and addressing rising costs, exploring the potential use of AI, including generative AI, to tackle challenges.\xa0', ""In 2023, utilities faced a decline as investor preference shifted from defensive stocks to mega-cap growth companies, particularly in the technology and communication services sectors. This led to utilities being one of the weakest-performing sectors in the S&P 500. However, by late 2023, utilities stocks experienced significantly lower valuations, trading at one of the largest discounts to the S&P in the past two decades, according to a Fidelity report. The utility sector's near-term performance may continue to be influenced by investor sentiment and economic conditions in 2024. If the economy maintains a soft landing with strong growth and low inflation, utilities may remain out of favor. Conversely, in the face of economic weakness, investors could turn back to defensive stocks like utilities, known for stability, durable cash flows, and dividends, especially during market volatility. A decline in interest rates could further benefit utility stocks by making their dividends more attractive compared to bonds. "", 'Looking at the longer term, utilities are positioned at the center of the shift from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to accelerate this transition by providing incentives for the adoption of clean-energy options and reducing greenhouse gasses. Consumers, businesses, and governments are actively working to decrease their carbon footprints, and forecasts suggest a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'Some of the best electric utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now. ', 'Considering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.', ""One investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades."", ""However, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods."", ""Like some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements."", ""So where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money."", ""In Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors."", 'So what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns?

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.64 per share, indicating a change of -1.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Hello and Welcome to the Halozyme Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Tram Bui. Please go ahead.', ""Tram Bui: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial and operating results conference call. In addition to the press release issued today after the market close, you could find a supplementary slide presentation that will be referenced during today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. Leading the call would be Dr. Helen Torley, Halozyme's President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an update on our business; and Nicole LaBrosse, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results as well as our outlook. On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements as outlined on Slide 2. I would also refer you to our SEC filings for a full list of risks and uncertainties."", ""During the call, both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release and slide presentation. I'll now hand the call over to Dr. Helen Torley."", ""Helen Torley: Thank you, Tram, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 3. We're very pleased to report our strong financial and operating results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. These results are driven by our two leading differentiated drug delivery technologies ENHANZE and our auto-injectors, and also by our two commercial products, XYOSTED and Hylenex. Moving to Slide 4. For 2023, we delivered a 26% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $829 million and reached a record $448 million in royalty revenue, which represents a 24% year-over-year increase. Strong operational performance drove another year of double-digit earnings growth, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 19% to $426 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 25% to $2.77 for the full year 2023."", ""We also deployed $400 million to shareholders through share repurchases, reflecting strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation priorities. Moving to Slide 5. Our achievements and our partner progress in 2023 contributed to the strong performance and paved the path for our strong long-term outlook. The total number of enhanced commercial products increased in 2023 from five to seven with the approval of argenx's VYVGART Hytrulo for generalized myasthenia gravis in the U.S. and Europe and the approval of Tecentriq subcutaneous in Great Britain. We also had multiple positive Phase 3 data readouts supporting regulatory submissions for approval of the enhanced subcutaneous formulations. Recall that we have a 100% success rate for approval of products delivered subcutaneously with ENHANZE when the Phase 3 trials have met their endpoints."", ""VYVGART Hytrulo Phase 3 data in CIDP was the first positive Phase 3 readout and upon approval, creates an expanded commercial opportunity in the condition where there is high unmet need today. argenx has already submitted the supplemental BLA for this indication using a priority review voucher which would support a potential approval by mid-year of 2024. We were also very excited with the positive data announcements from two additional Wave 3 products, Roche's Ocrelizumab subcutaneous ENHANZE and Bristol Myers Squibb's Nivolumab subcutaneous within ENHANZE, supporting global regulatory submissions and potential launch in 2024 for Ocrelizumab subcu and in 2025 for Nivolumab subcu. We also continued to advance and expand our pipeline. Johnson & Johnson presented data at ASCO from the Phase 1 amivantamab subcue with enhanced trial."", 'An important observation that was highlighted was the dramatically lower rate of infusion-related reactions with the subcutaneous at 16% compared to 67% reported with intravenous amivantamab, which is commercialized as Rybrevant. Infusion-related reactions can include mild symptoms such as chills, breathlessness and nausea, but can also be severe, making this reduction, if confirmed in the Phase 3 study, very meaningful to physicians. We are delighted that Johnson & Johnson recently announced strong progress with the Phase 3 study that they project will support submission of regulatory filings in 2024 for subcutaneous amivantamab with ENHANZE. Another significant achievement was ViiV advancing testing of their broadly neutralizing antibody, N6LS, for HIV.', ""Also in 2023, we reached an important milestone for our new high-volume auto-injector as we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of administering a subcutaneous injection of 10 milliliters of representative biologic immune globulin 10% with enhanced in approximately 30 seconds using our high volume auto-injector. And we were pleased to add a new ENHANZE partner Acumen Pharmaceuticals in the fourth quarter. We're delighted to be working with them to develop a subcutaneous delivery option for ACU193, bringing together Acumen's deep understanding of Alzheimer's and the amyloid beta oligomers with our enhanced platform. Moving now to Slide 6. With our strong track record of success and progress, as we look ahead, we have high confidence in the visibility of our revenue and we were delighted to recently share our 2024 guidance and our five-year financial outlook for the company."", ""For 2024, we're delighted to project continued strong growth of revenue with a guidance range of $915 million to $985 million, representing 10% to 19% year-over-year growth. Royalty revenue remains our top driver of our revenues and is projected to be $500 million to $525 million, representing growth of 12% to 17%. As a result of our disciplined approach to expense management and our business model, we are projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $535 million to $585 million, a remarkable 26% to 37% growth. I'll focus now on the five-year financial outlook. Total revenue is projected to reach $1 billion in 2025 and grow to greater than $1.5 billion in 2027 and 2028, with royalty revenue continued to be the key driver projected at $1 billion in 2027."", ""And impressively, we project adjusted EBITDA will grow faster than revenue in every year of the five-year outlook to an impressive $1 billion in 2028 with a five-year CAGR of 23%. I'll now turn to Slide 7 and review royalty revenue drivers in a bit more detail. Our Wave 2 products, DARZALEX/FASPRO and Phesgo, launched in 2020, have driven the impressive royalty revenues and growth illustrated on this chart and have many years of impressive growth ahead for them. Moving now to Slide 8 and to DARZALEX/FASPRO enabled by ENHANZE. With subcutaneous penetration in excess of 90% in the U.S., total brand growth has become the key driver for understanding subcutaneous performance for this product. In 2023, total DARZALEX sales continued to deliver strong growth for Johnson & Johnson, increasing approximately 23% year-over-year on an operational basis to $9.7 billion."", ""This strong growth was driven by share gains in all regions and continued growth in the first line setting. Supporting future growth in first line, it is notable to highlight that Johnson & Johnson recently submitted a supplemental BLA to the FDA to support a new indication for DARZALEX/FASPRO with ENHANZE for multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed adult patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. The results from their PERSEUS study, recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine supported this submission. The addition of DARZALEX/FASPRO to standard of care treatment resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement over today's standard of care alone in progression-free survival, complete response or better, and minimal residual disease negativity."", ""As we look forward, analysts continues to expect annual sales of DARZALEX to grow to approximately $17 billion by 2028, driven in large part by the first-line opportunity. I'll move now to Phesgo, which is illustrated on Slide 9. Phesgo offers the potential for patients with breast cancer to receive treatment as a simple subcutaneous injection over five minutes after the first dose and a total treatment and observation time of about 20 to 38 minutes, which compares to 2.5 hours to 7.5 hours total treatment and observation time for the IV. With this strong value proposition, Phesgo sales continued at an impressive rate of growth in 2023, increasing 64% to CHF1.1 billion for the full year as Roche continued to expand into additional markets while also driving global conversion rates higher."", ""Roche reported a 39% conversion rate in 46 launch countries. As we look at regional uptake, strong growth in contribution was reported for all regions. Us sales were CHF423 million growing at 48% and now representing close to 40% of total revenue. EU is growing at 52% and international was reported to be growing at greater than 150%. Roche stated that it expects continued growth of Phesgo with increasing conversion from the IV treatment Perjeta, which reported sales of CHF3.8 billion francs in 2023, with Roche projecting peak conversion of approximately 50%. We are excited to see the strong performance and the future growth that lies ahead for Phesgo. I'll now move to Slide 10 and our focus on our Wave 3 products and product candidates. What you see in the left panel are the 2023 launches and as you move across the slide to the right, the multiple product, regional and indication launches that are projected this year and next."", 'I will highlight that positive Phase 3 data and regulatory submission plans have been reported by our partners for all products with the exception of Amivantamab that has not yet reported its Phase 3 data. We are very excited with the large opportunity for the Wave 3, which is now comprised of five products that are projected by analysts to generate total sales of approximately $35 billion in 2028. I will start with VYVGART Hytrulo with ENHANZE which was approved in generalized myasthenia gravis in the U.S. in June of 2023 and in Europe in November. VYVGART Hytrulo with ENHANZE offers myasthenia gravis patients a new faster treatment delivery option delivered by healthcare practitioners in just 30 to 90 seconds. Notably, the European approval also allows for patient self-administration subcutaneously.', ""With the VYVGART Hytrulo subcutaneous launched just six months ago, argenx's focus has been on broadening commercial coverage and securing the data growth which was accomplished in January of this year. With this, we project growing adoption for VYVGART Hytrulo. The successful launch of VYVGART with $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023 supports the unmet need that exists for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis and the attractiveness of the VYVGART clinical profile. VYVGART Hytrulo adds the potential to expand the number of physicians using VYVGART and to expand use in the earlier lines of treatment. I'll now move to an exciting additional opportunity for VYVGART Hytrulo in that CIDP, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy."", ""Based on Organics's research and recent comments, 42,000 patients receive treatment today for CIDP. It's a condition where there is a high unmet need. Just 20% of patients get remission on the current standard of care treatment and 50% of patients report that they remain dissatisfied with the current burden of symptoms. The 61% reduction in risk of relapse with VYVGART Hytrulo versus placebo shown in the ADHERE study would upon approval offer an important new option for patients. And I'll highlight that this indication will be available only as a subcutaneous treatment enabled by ENHANZE. With the recent submission and use of their priority review voucher, argenx projects the possibility of approval for this new indication in the United States in mid-2024."", 'Moving now to Tecentriq. Tecentriq as an IV remains a key growth driver for Roche, with revenue growing 9% year-over-year to CHF3.8 billion in 2023. Tecentriq subcutaneous with ENHANZE was granted regulatory approval in Great Britain last year and in the European Union in January of 2024, for all of the approved IV indications. It is given as an approximately seven-minute subcutaneous delivery, which compares to 30 minutes to 60 minutes for the IV infusion. With U.K. conversion already reaching 18% essentially in one quarter, Roche believes that the opportunity for subcutaneous adoption remains significant. The US approval is projected in September of this year. Moving now to Ocrevus. Ocrevus as an IV is the leading treatment in the U.S. and EU5 for multiple sclerosis, with more than 300,000 patients treated globally and a higher retention rate than other multiple sclerosis medicines.', 'For the full year, Ocrevus generated an impressive CHF6.4 billion, which we estimate to be about $7 billion in revenue for Roche, which represents 13% year-over-year growth. ocrelizumab subcutaneous with ENHANZE creates a possibility for people living with multiple sclerosis to receive their treatment in just 10 minutes twice a year, which compares to 3.5 hours to 6.5 hours for the IV treatment and observation time. Roche commented on their recent quarterly call that they project the addition of availability of ocrelizumab subcu, which is enabled with ENHANZE to create a standalone blockbuster opportunity. As we have seen with DARZALEX subcutaneous, the availability of the subcutaneous delivery option can result in or accelerate market growth.', ""We project the availability of ocrelizumab subcutaneous with ENHANZE can create increased growth in two key ways: firstly, by allowing current multiple sclerosis centers to increase the number of patients treated as a result of improved throughput based on shorter time needed for each patient occupying an infusion chair; and secondly, by expanding the number of treatment centers by enabling multiple sclerosis centers that do not have IV infrastructure today to start administering ocrelizumab subcutaneously. Following the completed regulatory submissions in the U.S., EU and U.K. in 2023, we project the approval of ocrelizumab subcutaneous to represent our eighth ENHANZE royalty revenue generating product in 2024. Our next Wave 3 product is Bristol Myers Squibb's nivolumab subcutaneous with ENHANZE, which is the brand name Opdivo as the IV."", ""Opdivo IV sales were $9 billion in 2023, increasing 9% year-over-year, showing continued strong growth. In January, Bristol Myers Squibb presented the detailed result results of CheckMate-67T, the Phase 3 IV versus subcutaneous registration enabling study at ASCO-GI. As announced previously, the trial met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of the two co-primary endpoints, C average over 28 days and C min, a key powered secondary endpoint of overall response rate was also reported. Non-inferiority was also demonstrated with the overall response rate of 24.2% for the subcutaneous and 18% for the IV. Given in just five minutes, nivolumab subcutaneous has the potential to be practice-changing and to improve the patient's treatment experience."", ""Bristol Myers Squibb commented that the subcutaneous could potentially extend the franchise through the end of this decade and into the early 2030s, with the subcutaneous approval projected to cover up to 75% of the IV indications. And lastly, we were excited to have recently added Johnson & Johnson's amivantamab subcutaneous with ENHANZE into our Wave 3 potential launches with the potential for launch in 2025. Johnson & Johnson recently indicated that they expect Phase 3 data from the PALOMA 3 trial for amivantamab with ENHANZE plus lazertinib in 2024, supporting U.S. and European regulatory filings also in 2024. Amivantamab is already approved as an IV under the brand name RYBREVANT with Johnson & Johnson projecting, RYBREVANT will become a multi-billion dollar brand."", ""Let me now move to Slide 11 where I'll provide an update on our Wave 4 pipeline which is projected to support our future growth trajectory with potential launches in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe. We currently have a robust pipeline with seven exciting products in development. This reflects amivantamab moving to Wave 3 based on the updated potential launch timing and Amgen's decision to not move forward with a subcutaneous version of TEPEZZA with ENHANZE. Johnson & Johnson has also made the decision to not proceed with rilpivirine subcutaneous. The Wave 4 portfolio comprises of products across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology, immune disease and HIV. We have two products in Phase 3 development. This includes Bristol Myers Squibb's nivolumab with relatlimab with ENHANZE where the Phase 3 study is underway."", ""The IV version of [Opdualag] is projected by analysts to be a multi-billion dollar brand in 2028. The goal with the subcutaneous version is to offer a shorter, simpler treatment option, reducing patient burden and healthcare resources. Takeda's TAK-881, which is a 20% IGG with ENHANZE for primary immune deficiency, is the second Phase 3 development program. This would be the second 20% IGG to launch and will expand at Takeda's immune global offering for patients, creating a lower volume and potentially shorter treatment schedule. Last year, our ViiV collaboration also progressed with subcutaneous delivery of N6LS enabled by ENHANZE. N6LS is a broadly neutralizing antibody for HIV and it is advanced into a Phase 2b study in combination with Cabotegravir as a two drug regimen for HIV treatment."", ""Because of the rapidly changing nature of HIV and its potential to develop resistance to certain treatments, ViiV based on HIV community feedback has stated that there continues to be a need for medicines with unique mechanisms of action like the broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may open up a completely new approach to treating HIV. Separately, we continue to be pleased to collaborate with our argenx on ARGX-117, now named Empasiprubart. And in addition, we have two remaining programs in Wave 4 that are confidential at the request of our partners. I'll move now to Slide 12. Let me now spend a moment on our high volume auto-injector. We were excited last year to demonstrate delivery of 10 mLs of a representative biologic co-formulated with ENHANZE in just 30 seconds with our innovative new high-volume auto-injector."", ""ENHANZE is the key ingredient that makes this possible. For patients, this can offer the option for home delivery or rapid delivery in the physician's office. Our goal with the high-volume auto-injector offering is to expand upon establishing ENHANZE collaborations and add new collaboration partners. I'm pleased to announce that one of our current partners is initiating a human factors test of the high-volume auto-injector to evaluate device usability. This test is scheduled to start this quarter. I'll turn now to new enhanced deals. We continue to have strong and expanding interest by existing and new partners. While we were disappointed by the slow progress in decision-making by companies in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to expand our pipeline in 2024."", ""This year started with expanded interest from potential new partners with a busy schedule of meetings in January and February already with partners expressing interest in ENHANZE, the high volume on auto-injector, and in some cases, the small volume auto-injector technology. I look forward to providing updates and progress on new agreements throughout the year. I'll now turn to our commercial portfolio, XYOSTED sales achieved $100 million in 2023, demonstrating strong growth. This sales attainment met our target revenue for the year and breakeven in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects successful execution of our three-pronged strategy, which includes targeting the switch of patients who are not achieving their treatment goals with intramuscular injections, enhancing adherence with specialty pharmacies executing educational programs to support patients staying on treatment, and continued actions to improve the net sales price."", 'With a market of more than 9.5 million scripts a year and our share approaching 5%, we see a clear path for continued growth in revenue and EBITDA contribution in 2024 with a CAGR projection of 25% through 2028. Let me now turn the call over to Nicole who will discuss our financial results in more detail.', 'Nicole LaBrosse: Thank you, Helen. The fourth quarter marked a strong end to 2023. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and achieved another record quarter of royalty revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth outpaced the top line, reflecting the significant leverage we generate as we grow royalty revenue. Let me start with capital allocation on Slide 13. We remain committed to our three capital allocation priorities of investing in the business to maximize revenue growth and durability, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and adding new growth opportunities through M&A. In November 2023, we initiated a $250 million Accelerated Share Repurchase, or ASR. This will operate to repurchase our shares for a number of months into 2024.', 'This brings our total share buyback since the inception of the first program in 2019 to $1.3 billion. I am also pleased to announce that our Board authorized a new $750 million repurchase program, reflecting our continued commitment to balanced capital allocation and a focus on driving value for shareholders. Turning now to Slide 14 for our detailed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 27% to $230 million, compared to $181.5 million in the prior year period. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $122.1 million, an increase of 15% compared to $106 million in the prior year period, driven by continued strong performance of Wave 2 products, subcutaneous DARZALEX/FASPRO. Note that Q4 of 2022 reflected a measurement period adjustment to amortization of intangibles to our current run rate of $17.8 million a quarter.', 'Other operating expenses remained relatively flat period over period due to our leverageable business model, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 47% to $121.7 million from $83 million in the prior year period. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $336 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $483.3 million as of September 30, 2023. The reduction is due to the use of $250 million for the ASR offset by positive cash generation in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.5 times and we expect to decrease net leverage each quarter with EBITDA growth. Turning now to Slide 15 for our detailed financial results for the full year 2023. I will briefly touch on some highlights here with more details available in our press release and the 10-k filed with the SEC today.', 'Recall that we closed the Antares acquisition on May 24, 2022, and therefore the year-over-year comparison is impacted by a full year versus a partial year of contribution from the Antares business. Total revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $829.3 million in 2023, off in an already substantial revenue base in 2022 of $660.1 million. The main contributor to this increase was higher revenue from royalties of $447.9 million, reflecting growth of 24%, as well as higher ENHANZE product sales in XYOSTED sales growth. Also note that the revenue growth was offset by the timing of milestones recognized in the prior year. Recall that the timing of a milestone for Tecentriq SC in the U.S. was planned for the third quarter of 2023 and is now expected in September 2024.', 'Research and development expenses were $76.4 million compared to $66.6 million in 2022, primarily due to increased compensation expenses resulting from the addition of a new platform, our device platform, as well as plan investments in ENHANZE. Selling general and administrative expenses were $149.2 million compared to $143.5 million in 2022, primarily due to the addition of resources in sales and marketing with the addition of our commercial products, XYOSTED, offset by one-time transaction costs related to the Antares acquisition that occurred in the second quarter of 2022 of approximately $38 million.

GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.10 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.77.', 'This is compared with GAAP diluted earnings per share of a dollar and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 in 2022. Turning now to Slide 16, in our 2024 guidance, we are reiterating our top-line adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full year 2024 that was provided in January.

It's easy to find stocks that are doing well during a bull run, but some end up rising too much, too fast, leading to significant corrections once things turn sour."", ""Finding stocks that aren't keeping pace with broader equities can be a decent strategy, provided there are good reasons to think these corporations can turn things around and deliver solid returns over the long run. Let's discuss two beaten-down stocks worth buying in this ongoing bull market: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Doximity (NYSE: DOCS)."", ""Johnson & Johnson has been around for over a century, but that's no guarantee it will continue to thrive for a long time. In recent years, the drugmaker has dealt with more and more legal challenges, including thousands of lawsuits related to its talc-based products that allegedly gave consumers cancer."", 'Then, in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) became law in the U.S. and, among other things, granted Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of drugs. That will reduce revenue for the companies that make the medicines Medicare will target. Johnson & Johnson is on that list.', ""With all that going on, can J&J still deliver decent returns? The answer is a resounding yes. Despite its legal troubles, the company's underlying business remains strong, especially its balance sheet. Johnson & Johnson is one of the very few companies with a credit rating higher than the U.S. government's."", 'But the company also has decent growth prospects. Having separated its low-growth consumer health business, J&J is doubling down on its pharmaceutical and medtech units. That should allow the company to increase its revenue at a faster pace.', ""The drugmaker's IRA-related problems shouldn't be much of an issue for now. Its deep pipeline should allow it to get around that potential obstacle in the medium term. After all, the company is great at developing brand-new medicines. Last year, it earned approval for a novel cancer medicine, Talvey. With dozens of ongoing programs, Johnson & Johnson should see even more success."", ""Let's not forget J&J's streak of 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. The dividend doesn't look like it's in danger, so the stock remains an excellent target for income-seekers."", ""However, Johnson & Johnson probably isn't for investors looking for high-growth companies. Even with improved top-line growth rates thanks to the spinoff of its consumer health segment, there are much better companies in this regard. Still, the drugmaker may be ideal for low-risk-tolerance, dividend-seeking investors focused on the long game."", ""Doximity is a networking platform for medical professionals, but the company offers many other services, too. Its news feeds help physicians read important developments in their fields, clinical trial results, and more. Doximity's telehealth function helps doctors connect with patients, and the platform allows them to securely send private documents."", ""The company earns most of its money by charging fees to pharmaceutical companies and hospital systems that pay to advertise drugs, jobs, or other things on its platform. Doximity became a publicly traded corporation in mid-2021, after which its shares initially soared. However, it's been a downward spiral for the better part of two years now. What gives?"", ""Doximity's slowing revenue growth rates have been a significant factor. In its latest reporting period (ended Dec. 31), the third quarter of its fiscal 2024, Doximity's revenue increased about 17% year over year to $135.3 million. Here's how that compares to previous quarters:"", ""However, there were some bright spots. The company remains deeply profitable and boasts incredibly juicy margins. Its net income totaled nearly $48 million, up 43.2% from the year-ago period. The company's net profit margin climbed to 35.4%, compared to the 29% reported in the prior-year quarter."", 'Even while the top line has not grown as fast, Doximity has been able to keep its cost of goods sold and operating expenses well in check. Sales are still growing faster than both categories. And Doximity still has a massive addressable market. The company sees an $18.5 billion opportunity, of which it has grabbed just a fraction.', ""It's also worth noting that Doximity benefits from the network effect. The company estimates that more than 80% of physicians in the U.S., as well as the top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals, are current users. The more physicians join its platform, the more it becomes attractive to hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare professionals who have yet to opt in."", 'That should allow Doximity to remain a leader in this small niche in the next decade.

People will always need care, and the industry constantly looks for new and better ways to provide it. Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is a longtime staple in healthcare, as evidenced by its long history and 46 years of consecutive dividend growth.', ""The stock has outperformed the broader market over its lifetime but is nearly 40% off its highs today. Is this a dip worth buying, or is Medtronic's business losing its luster? This Fool investigated to find out. Here is what I found."", ""Medtronic provides medical devices, equipment, and supplies worldwide. The United States, the world's largest healthcare market, contributes roughly half of Medtronic's sales. The rest comes from both developed and emerging international markets. The pitfall of global markets is that Medtronic, which reports its financials in U.S. dollars, must translate its international revenue to dollars. An unfavorable exchange rate can understate Medtronic's reported profits."", 'The company recently reported its second-quarter earnings for the 2024 fiscal year; earnings per share (EPS) were $1.25, a 3.8% year-over-year decline. Taking out the effect of currency rates, EPS grew 2.3% over the prior year.', ""Additionally, gross profit margins have declined a few percentage points in recent quarters due to inflation, something management spoke about in its most recent earnings call. The downside of doing business in emerging markets is that they generally can't afford to spend nearly as much as developed countries, so Medtronic doesn't have the room to raise prices and offset its rising costs as it might with U.S. customers."", ""These headwinds have cratered growth estimates, and it looks like that's the culprit for Medtronic's share price woes. And to be frank, that's fair. Medtronic is feeling these headwinds on its bottom line. The question for investors is whether the business is broken or this is just a passing storm."", ""Medtronic can't do much to control how currency exchange impacts its business. It can work through inflation by cutting expenses and working on price increases. So these headwinds seem more temporary than anything, especially with Medtronic delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth."", ""But the headwinds have weakened Medtronic's financials, which investors should watch moving forward. Most notable is the drop in free cash flow. The drop has increased the company's dividend payout ratio to roughly 90%, leaving little room for management to do things like pay down debt on a balance sheet holding nearly three times as much debt as Medtronic's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)."", ""Don't get me wrong. Investors shouldn't panic. Medtronic is still a financially stable company. The corporate ratings agencies give Medtronic's credit an A rating with a stable outlook, which is comfortably investment-grade. The biggest concern is Medtronic's current lack of financial flexibility. It's not a crisis, but you'd like a lower payout ratio and a cleaner balance sheet."", ""Are you looking for a quick rebound and profit on Medtronic? Pump the brakes. The company's lower growth and weakened financials justify the stock's decline. These headwinds will probably need to pass before the stock comes alive again."", ""The good news is that shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16, down from 24 years ago. If Medtronic can accelerate its earnings growth to somewhere near 10%, today's valuation could be a bargain. Medtronic doesn't look like a broken business, but it faces financial headaches from things it can't do much about right now."", ""A long-term investor willing to buy and wait for a turnaround might buy Medtronic today.

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. And I appreciate that you're joining us this morning for our Fiscal '24 Third Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 26th, 2024, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs covering our segments will join us."", ""And we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements. And actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC."", ""And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and third quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business separations. There were no acquisitions made in the last four quarters, that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal '24 and are made on an as-reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue-share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated."", ""Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. [Video Presentation]"", ""Geoff Martha: Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our momentum and solid execution continued this quarter as we establish a track-record of consistently delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Diabetes took another step forward with double-digit growth supported by a return to growth in the US. I'd also note that particular strength we saw in multiple businesses like Core Spine, Cardiac Surgery, Structural Heart and Cardiac Pacing. And we had strong growth across International markets as we expand access to our innovative healthcare technologies all around the globe. At the same time, we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities."", ""We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech. We also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company. We're incorporating a performance driven culture that's based on execution, speed and playing to win. And we're leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies. So when you look at our financials this quarter, you're seeing the early results of our focus on restoring earnings power and converting our earnings into strong cash-flow, and we're using that cash to both invest in high-return opportunities and return value to our shareholders. So we're executing and we're delivering, and we expect to continue over the coming quarters and years given our momentum."", ""Our ongoing transformation, our breakthrough innovation, our exposure to strong secular growth markets and our numerous catalysts across the business. Now, before I get into the details of our Q3 results, I do want to mention that we provided a Portfolio Management update this morning on our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses. After a comprehensive review, we have decided to exit our unprofitable ventilator product line. And retain and bring together our remaining PMRI businesses into one business, which we're calling acute-care and monitoring. Now we've determined, it is in the best interest of Medtronic, its stakeholders, the ACM business both near and long-term to exit vents because of its increasing unprofitability and market preference shift to lower acuity ventilators."", ""Now as we exit vents, I want to recognize the strong legacy of our business and the Puritan Bennett brand. And we're committed to serving the needs of our customers and honoring our ventilator service contracts. And I also want to thank the employees in our ventilator business, who played an incredible role during the pandemic to dramatically expand production to get ventilators to the communities around the world that needed them. And while we exit, we do believe that existing manufacturers can meet the customer demand for new ventilators going forward. Now at the same time, we decided to retain and refocus the remaining PMRI businesses. Three main factors have driven this decision. First, we have strong conviction in our ability to lead and drive growth in acute-care and monitoring, given our improved competitive position."", ""And our ability to properly fund this business with savings from exiting vents. Second, the importance of data in this space is changing rapidly. It's becoming the basis of innovation. And this fact further improves our competitive differentiation. And lastly, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable, innovation-driven growth and category leadership and ACM can deliver both. That does not mean we will shy away from additional portfolio moves going forward. But the bar is high for any strategic activity that dilutes our focus on our profit and growth. So when you take these decisions together, we're able to provide increased investment for acute-care and monitoring, using the savings from vents and bringing two businesses together, all without creating dilution to our P&L."", ""Now let's get into the details behind our Q3 results. We continue to look at our portfolio in three categories, established market leaders, synergistic and highest-growth businesses. In this quarter all three grew in line with our expected growth algorithm. Our established market leader and synergistic businesses grew mid-single-digits, while our highest growth businesses posted high-single-digit growth and we expect their contribution to our overall growth to further accelerate in the quarters ahead. Now, looking first at the established market leaders, a combined they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 4%. Starting with Cranial & Spinal Technologies. We're driving consistent above-market growth on the continued adoption of our AiBLE ecosystem."", ""CST delivered high-single-digit growth in Core Spine, mid-teens growth in biologics and high-single-digit growth in enabling technology. We had strong double-digit unit growth in StealthStation navigation, O-arm Imaging and Mazor robotic systems. A leading indicator for future growth in this business. We also continue to see strong adoption of UNiD Adaptive Spine Intelligence, our integrated AI-based surgical planning solution. Now with AiBLE, we're offering a complete robust ecosystem of enabling technologies and associated implants for spine surgeons. Our global footprint, which includes over 10,000 systems is over four times greater than the nearest competitor. And with this scale and extensive and rapidly increasing installed-base, we're transforming the spine industry, we are leading the way."", ""As more surgeons adopt our integrated spine technologies and in an environment where there is disruption from consolidation, we're attracting the best sales teams to Medtronic to grow and expand our business. Next in surgical, we grew 3%, our Wound Management business won share growing in the high-teens on the strength of our V-Loc barbed sutures. We also had solid mid-single-digit growth in hernia products, as we won share in synthetic permanent mesh with our ProGrip platform. And as expected, our surgical growth continue to have a modest impact from declines in bariatric surgery. Now we still believe this impact will be temporary as more patients become eligible for surgery, and as patients seek a more permanent treatment to weightloss. To wrap up our established market leaders, Cardiac Rhythm also grew 3%, driven by high-single-digit growth in cardiac pacing, our micro leadless pacemakers continued to post strong results growing 15% driven by the launch of our next-generation Micra AV2 and VR2 devices."", ""We're also benefiting from the adoption of conduction system pacing, an alternative to traditional single or dual chamber pacing. Our 38-30 lead the only one on the market approved for conduction system pacing, continue to grow strong double-digits. In CRM, we also began training and the limited launch of our Aurora EV-ICD. We expect the EV-ICD to reaccelerate our Defibrillation Solutions growth in the coming quarters. As I've shared with you in the past, Aurora is a game-changer in the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD including similar-size, longevity and pacing features. But without the leads in the harder veins, and these benefits can be realized with one device and only one implant procedure. We expect our advantages will not only displace the competitor's device, we will expand the population far beyond the existing segment and be a strong growth driver for CRM."", ""Now turning to our synergistic businesses, combined they grew mid-single-digits in Q3. And I'll highlight some of the drivers here. Let's start with Aortic which grew 13% on supply recovery and continued momentum of our Endurant AAA franchise. Cardiac Surgery grew 10% driven by strength in Perfusion and Cannula and ECLS Oxygenators, given competitor quality issues and the strong sales in international markets of our Avalus surgical valve. Coronary grew 7%, driven by double-digit growth in both guide catheters and balloons. And we increased our drug-eluting stent share in the US and in Europe on the continued rollout of our Onyx Frontier drug-eluting stent. Now turning to businesses in our highest-growth markets. As I mentioned earlier, together these businesses grew in the high-single-digits this quarter, and we expect their contribution to our growth to accelerate going forward."", ""Now diabetes led the way, growing double-digits on the global adoption of our game-changing MiniMed 780G system. We're seeing strong sequential momentum, growing 5% over the prior quarter. Our customer base is growing sequentially and we're driving more revenue per customer. In the US, we not only returned to growth, we grew mid-single-digits, driven by nearly 50% revenue growth and insulin pumps. We doubled our new users year-over-year, attracting those on multiple daily injection as well as users of competitor systems. Users are choosing 780G for the outcomes it delivers. With intensive insulin users, these outcomes matter. And the 780G is highly differentiated. It's the only AID system to automatically adjust and correct sugars every five minutes."", ""It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100, and features are proprietary meal detection technology. This leads to high time and range for users. And this type of glycemic control is coming with less effort and burden. As users realize the relief that comes from spending more time in automation with our SmartGuard technology. It's worth pointing out that in a recent third-party survey of nearly 2,000 US diabetes pump users, the 780G scored number-one in overall pump satisfaction, among Type 1 CGM users our Guardian 4 Sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction. And during the quarter, we secured CE Mark for our Simplera Sync sensor for use with the 780G, and we look to begin the limited release this spring. And in US, we're planning to submit the 780G with Simplera Sync to the FDA in the first half of this calendar year."", ""Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor. It has a disposable design and is much easier to put on. Now we've been driving the diabetes turnaround for some time, and I got to tell you it certainly feels really good to return to double-digit growth. But we're not finished here, there is definitely more work to be done as we work to bring to market an even more robust ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps sensors and algorithms. And as the intensive insulin management space moves to using smart dosing through either AID or Smart MDI, we expect an acceleration in the growth contribution from our diabetes business. Now turning to Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we delivered 11% growth in International markets, including 9% growth in Western Europe."", ""Our strong International growth as well as our overall performance continues to be driven by our leading Arctic Front cryo solution as Pulsed Field Ablation is still in the early stages. We are seeing though a lot of enthusiasm in the market for our PFA products. In Europe, we're the only company with PFA offerings for both the single shot and the focal segments. And in single shot, we have now started the limited market release of our PulseSelect PFA system here in fiscal Q4. And we're seeing very efficient procedures, and after just a couple of cases. And so the learning curve is really short. The catheter handling and maneuverability has been excellent due to its small shaft and our custom 10Fr bidirectional sheath. Clinicians are also reporting no noticeable muscle contraction with our PFA product, which is beneficial for patient experience."", ""In focal, we continue to ramp manufacturing of the Affera Mapping System and Sphere9 catheter and remain in limited market release in Europe. Sphere9 is the only catheter that can perform both pulsed field ablation and radiofrequency ablation and high-density mapping. It's really an all-in-one catheter. In the US, our CAS business declined in the quarter. We faced the first full quarter of competition in the cryoablation space, which is a space we created and had been the only player. In addition, many customers actually held back purchases as they awaited the launch of our PulseSelect PFA catheter, which is now commercially available. We do expect to improve from here as we roll-out the recently approved next-generation Nitron CryoConsole and PulseSelect, the only PFA catheter FDA-approved for both paroxysmal and persistent AF."", ""And in addition to the European feedback, clinicians have consistently commented on how well it's visualized and how easily it connects to their mapping system. So, we're also making progress in bringing our Affera Mapping System and Sphere9 catheter to the US. With the last patient follow up in our SPHERE Per-AF Pivotal Trial now completed. We expect to see the results at a medical meeting in the first half of this calendar year. With an $8 billion market size, expanding our share in this underpenetrated cardiac ablation space is a big opportunity for us. We expect our growth profile to improve over time. First, moving towards market growth and then winning share as we bring our rich pipeline of innovation to patients you need this technology."", 'In neurovascular this quarter we grew high single-digits, when you exclude sales in China, where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. We continue to have strong double-digit growth and flow diversion globally. This is being driven by our innovative Shield Technology for treating brain aneurysms, which is available on both Pipeline Flex and Vantage flow diverters. In Robotic Surgical Technologies, we continued growing the installed base for our differentiated Hugo Robotic System in International markets. In the US our EXPAND URO pivotal trial continues to enrol and we expect to have first enrollment in our hernia trial very soon. We expect Hugo equipped with advanced digital capabilities to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead.', ""We believe surgeon preference for our open console and modular design, our leading position in minimally-invasive surgery and instrumentation, our connected digital ecosystem and data-enabled insights along with our world-class surgical training program and partnerships will meaningfully advance the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. Now turning to Structural Heart, we grew high-single-digits in the quarter, including mid-single-digit sequentially, as we see ongoing adoption of Evolut FX and its improved design and market-leading valve performance. In Europe, where FX was launched for the first full quarter, we grew double-digits. And Japan grew in the low 20s on the continued adoption of FX. I'm pleased to share the news today that we have submitted Evolut FX+ to the FDA for approval."", ""FX+ has three windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access, while providing the same dependable valve performance of our Evolut platform. And we were also pleased to hear that one-year trial results of our SMART Trial will be presented as a late-breaker at ACC, on April 7th. We're excited to see the results and are looking-forward to having both FX+ and the SMART Trial as well as the continued strength of our four year low-risk data as catalysts for our Structural Heart business. Now with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at our Q3 financial performance and our fiscal '24 guidance raise. Karen?"", ""Karen Parkhill: So looking at our financials, our third quarter was another quarter where we delivered on our commitments. Our revenue grew 4.6% ahead of expectations, and adjusted EPS was $1.30, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. We attribute the beat to stronger-than-expected revenue growth and gross margin, offset by $0.04 from greater-than-anticipated currency impact, primarily from the devaluation in the Argentine peso in December. We're delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and have now for several quarters. As Geoff mentioned, International markets were an important driver for us. Our non-US developed markets grew 6%, including 8% growth in Western Europe and 7% growth in Japan. In fact, we had double-digit growth in several of our businesses across both of those regions."", 'Emerging markets grew 10%, we had high-teens growth in the Middle-East and Africa and mid-teens growth in South Asia. China grew low-double-digits as some of the VBP we expected there continues to be delayed. And Eastern Europe grow in the low-single digits given Russian sanctions. In the US, we grew 2%, we have several new product approvals that are at the earliest stages of their launches and expect those launches to positively impact our US growth over the next couple of quarters and beyond. Looking down the P&L, we delivered a strong quarter. Both our adjusted gross and operating margins were ahead of expectations. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.1% improved year-over-year, overcoming a 60 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange and continued elevated inflation.', 'We attribute the favorability primarily to the delayed China VBP and lower freight costs. We also continue to see traction from our pricing efforts and an early benefit from our comprehensive COGS efficiency efforts. While our adjusted operating margin of 25.2% declined 70 basis points, it was entirely driven by currency. In fact operating margin on a constant currency basis was up 160 basis points from improvement in gross margin and strong SG&A leverage, as we continue to drive efficiencies across the enterprise. Below the operating margin line, our adjusted tax rate was a little higher than anticipated, mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of profits. On the flip side, income on our investments was also a little better than expected with higher rates.', ""It's worth noting that while our adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, it grew 8.5% on a constant currency basis from the leverage we drove down the P&L. We also significantly improved our free cash flow and conversion in the quarter. Now turning to guidance. Given our top and bottom-line beat and continued strength in our underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%. For the fourth quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp-adjusted basis, this is an acceleration from the third quarter, as we continue to ramp our recent product launches. With the exit of ventilators that we announced today, we are moving the associated revenue to the other segment, starting in the fourth quarter."", ""As is the case with all revenue in other, we will exclude it from our organic revenue growth. And additional details can be found in our third quarter earnings presentation. Regarding currency based on recent rates, we would see a full-year revenue impact in the range of an unfavorable $15 million to a favorable $35 million, including an unfavorable impact of $70 million to $120 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line with the beat in the third quarter, we're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.04 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.19 to $5.21. I'd point out that given our durable performance, we've been able to increase this guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.46."", ""And regarding currency based on recent rates, we're seeing an unfavorable impact of 7% on full year EPS, including an unfavorable 5% impact in the fourth quarter. Lastly, while we'll give our fiscal year '25 guidance on our earnings call in May, after we finish our planning, I want to share our early thoughts. You've seen us deliver durable revenue growth for several quarters, and we expect that to continue. Down the P&L inflation, currency and tax are currently headwinds to earnings growth. And we expect to continue to increase our investments in R&D. That said, we're very focused on driving offsets, where we can, and improving the earnings power of the company. And regarding the portfolio management decisions we announced today, while the Street's FY'25 numbers didn't yet reflect the potential separation, with today's decision we're able to increase investment in innovation-driven growth without near-term earnings dilution or an ongoing impact to cash-flow, all with a focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value."", 'I want to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to all of our employees for your hard work and unwavering commitment to the Medtronic mission. Your dedication was instrumental in achieving our results this quarter, and making a difference for so many people around the world. Thank you. Geoff, turning it back to you to take it home.', ""Geoff Martha: Okay, thank you. But before I wrap up, I want to note that Tom Holleran passed away last week at the age of 94. Tom provided decades of leadership to our company. First as General Counsel, next as President and as a Director on our Board for many, many years. In the early 60s, Tom was one of the instrumental people who created our Medtronic mission together with our founder, Earl Bakken. Tom was also a significant leader in the twin cities and beyond and served on several company boards. Our thoughts are with Tom's family as they celebrate his life. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief concluding comments on our progress. You see now for several quarters in a row that we're delivering on our commitments with durable mid-single-digit revenue growth."", ""And when you look over the last couple of quarters, we've had a rapid cadence of meaningful innovative product approvals, many of which are just getting started, including EV-ICD, both PulseSelect and Affera in PFA. Inceptiv for SCS, Percept RC for DBS. And of course, our new Simplera Sync sensor in diabetes. And we can't forget Symplicity for hypertension. When you combine these with our investments to enter surgical robotics, along with the strong execution we're having in businesses like spine and diabetes, this is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering durable growth. At the same time, we've been sharing with you our efforts to restore the earnings power of the company. And we're seeing those efforts begin to show up in our financials."", ""And the comprehensive transformation that we've been working on streamlining our operating model, aligning incentives, revamping our capital and portfolio management activities and instilling a performance-driven culture, well, this is also having an impact. These changes take time and we're certainly not done, but it's very encouraging to see our progress and where we stand today. And equally exciting are the catalysts that we see coming, which we believe will lead to significant advancements for patients and value-creation for both healthcare systems around the world and our shareholders. So with that, let's move to Q&A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question."", 'And only if needed a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question.', ""A - Brad Welnick: [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical-Surgical Portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Republic Services (NYSE:RSG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' See our latest analysis for Republic Services ', ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Republic Services' EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for Republic Services remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$15b. That's a real positive."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Republic Services' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""Since Republic Services has a market capitalisation of US$57b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$56m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders."", ""While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Republic Services, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m."", ""The Republic Services CEO received US$9.8m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making."", ""You can't deny that Republic Services has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Republic Services look rather interesting indeed. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Republic Services has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases."", 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Mosaic's current trading price of US$30.23 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy?

According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $47.07, but it is currently trading at US$30.23 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mosaic’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market.

Although MOS is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the technological advancements in this segment of military warfare and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.', 'The wars between Azerbaijan and Armenia first in 2020, and then later involving Russia and Ukraine have been the kind of conflicts that western powers had been worrying about, and are now scrambling to prepare themselves for a future that already seems to be here. Demand for military drones have surged over the last few years with countries actively using their unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target operations.', 'Drones were a prominent feature of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and have been clouding the skies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Borodyanka among other towns and cities in Ukraine, in what is being seen as the arrival of a new threat in the aerial defense space. These uninhabited aerial vehicles have made it difficult for enemy targets to move and hide on the battlefield with their aerial footages offering unprecedented birds-eye views of the war.', 'The Americans have been operating drones for about a century now, having deployed them first during World War II, between 1939 and 1945, and then more recently in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. Defense experts believe the proliferation of military drones is a concern for US policymakers who worry about China taking a leaf out of Russia’s book (strikes on Ukraine), and launching similar attacks against US interests in the Pacific. Moreover, US troops have also come under drone attacks from non-state actors in the Middle East in recent years – most notably from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.', 'Considering the rapidly evolving threat, the Americans are taking initiatives to stay a step ahead of their foes. In August 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced to build ‘attritable autonomous systems’ in mass over the next two years. Moreover, under the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the US Air Force plans to develop drone wingmen to fly alongside its premier fighter and bomber jets – Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)’s B-21 Raider.', 'These unmanned combat air vehicles will be used to perform several missions, such as surveillance, striking enemies and jamming their signals. The Air Force expects about a thousand CCAs to enter service by 2028, which will mean that they would be ready for deployment with the sixth-generation of fighter jets that are currently being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.', 'According to a report, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and General Atomics, are all vying for contracts for the classified CCA initiative.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s RQ-170 Sentinel was introduced in 2007, and is operated by the Air Force for CIA missions. On the other hand, the MQ-9 Reaper built by General Atomics is one of the most potent drones operated by the US, and serves as the primary offensive strike uninhabited aerial vehicle of the Air Force.', 'The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently overseeing the development of the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which will become the first unmanned aerial refueling vehicle that will be carrier-based and will extend the range of the US Navy’s aircraft carriers.

214,461dc187-a538-3bba-8c6f-4a27711f7b8b,BA,2024-02-22,How Boeing broke down: Inside the series of leadership failures that hobbled the airline giant,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-broke-down-inside-series-110000958.html,1708599600,STORY,"['BA', 'ALK']","['It was the blowout heard round the world.', 'It was Jan. 5, just after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 had taken off from Portland, Ore., en route to Ontario, Calif., when a two-by-four-foot panel blew out at three miles high, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max. “There was the loudest explosion,” recalled passenger Joan Marin. “The wind, the noise, the roar.” Terrified passengers grabbed for falling oxygen masks. The intense vacuum ripped the V-neck sweater and T-shirt from a 15-year-old in a window seat at the edge of the void, and sent his headset and cell phone flying into the evening sky.', ""For Boeing, the company that built the plane, it was a crushing blow. The 108-year-old corporate icon had been dogged by safety concerns since two fatal crashes darkened its reputation and sent its finances reeling a half-decade ago—the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters that together killed 346 people. The response to those catastrophes got then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg fired, and current CEO David Calhoun, a 26-year GE veteran, took the helm in January of 2020. Professed Calhoun following the door blowout: “We’re going to approach this, number one, by acknowledging our mistake. We’re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.” The disaster's jet stream claimed the 737's program's production chief, whom Boeing ousted on February 21."", 'Customers were not appeased. In a CNBC interview on Jan. 23, outspoken United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby declared that the Alaska Airlines accident will significantly set back the timeline for approval of the 737-10, which Kirby had previously chosen as a principal aircraft in United’s ambitious blueprint for expansion. He isn’t saying that United will cancel its standing orders. But he strongly suggests that his airline is no longer making the 737-10 the main vehicle for the liftoff to come. “We’re going to at least build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it,” said Kirby. “The Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us.”', 'As customers fumed, Boeing’s principal regulator imposed tough new restrictions that will greatly limit the planemaker’s freedom of action. On Jan. 24, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) took the extraordinary measure of capping the output for the entire Max lineup now in commercial production, consisting of the 737-8 and 737-9, at the current rate of 38 per month. That’s a serious blow, since Boeing was basing its comeback campaign on gradually raising its monthly Max output to 50 by 2025 or 2026. As part of its expansion blueprint, Boeing had planned to open a new production line at its facility in Everett, Wash., for the Max, north of the plant in Renton, where it makes all its 737s today. But the Portland catastrophe prompted the FAA to withhold approval for now on the Everett addition, until Boeing shows the progress required by the FAA. In a press release, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker declared: “This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing.”', 'Boeing’s trajectory from here towers as one of the most significant business dramas of this millennium. U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, over one-quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers. Boeing produced around 40% of the 29,000 commercial aircraft filling the skies worldwide. This is the company that launched the jet age; created the world’s first wide-body in its fabled 747; ranks as America’s third biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin and RTX, and has long reigned as America’s largest exporter. But Boeing is stumbling just when it should be capitalizing on the boom.', 'The rub is that Boeing’s quality shortcomings—and heavy dependence on a far-flung network of suppliers—are recurring and deep-seated. The problem isn’t merely that one worker on one assembly line failed to install a door screw. It was that managerial decisions, made over a period that spanned more than 20 years and four CEOs, gradually weakened a once vaunted system of quality control and troubleshooting on the factory floor, leaving gaps that have allowed sundry defects to slip through. Many weren’t related to airline safety but caused long delays; others had major and tragic consequences. “The seeds of these quality problems were planted a long time ago. These problems were hidden for years, then they exploded,” says a former top executive at a Boeing supplier.', 'When Boeing taxied toward “capital light” manufacturing, Wall Street got exactly what it wanted. Investors were richly rewarded; for one heady stretch in the 2010s, Boeing’s shares outperformed those of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But it would ultimately be Boeing—and its passengers—that would end up paying the price.', 'The structural weaknesses in Boeing’s planemaking flow can actually be quite neatly traced to strategic missteps that took root over three decades ago.', 'Surprisingly, the first big mistake occurred under CEO Phil Condit, an engineer steeped in the tradition of caution, safety, and excellence in design. In 2001, Condit persuaded the board to relocate Boeing’s headquarters to Chicago from Seattle, where the C-suites were a short drive to the giant plants in Renton and Everett that generated the lion’s share of revenue. The idea was to establish a “neutral” nerve center in easier traveling distance to Boeing’s other businesses, including its defense and space arm in Arlington, Va. Then in 2022, Boeing relocated again, this time to Arlington.', 'Shifting the top brass far from Boeing’s biggest business, and the one that’s suffered the severest problems, was a huge mistake in the opinion of several of Boeing suppliers and clients Fortune spoke to. Says a former top executive at a Boeing customer whom Fortune interviewed on background: “Why take one of the greatest manufacturing companies in the world and create a de-linkage between the leadership and the wrench-turners who make the company go?” this person asks. “That, coupled with all the outsourcing, created a kind of Frankenstein without enough command and control.”', 'And Boeing’s current top executives are now extremely dispersed. Though the commercial aircraft chiefs are based in Seattle, CFO Brian West and the treasurer work from suburban Connecticut, and the HR and PR heads from Orlando. It’s not clear how much time Calhoun, who served as chairman before being named CEO, spent in Renton or Everett, prior to the Portland disaster. He’s stated that Boeing’s headquarters “is wherever Brian and I happen to be.” The 66-year-old boss has two homes—one on a lake in New Hampshire, and one in a gated community in South Carolina.', 'A landmark shift in Boeing’s direction began when it purchased defense contractor McDonnell Douglas in mid-1997. Before the merger, the planemaker had been “an association of engineers dedicated to building great flying machines,” who put design and quality above all else, in the words of journalist Jerry Useem, who wrote a Fortune piece based on extensive interviews at Boeing in 2000, when the battle between the engineering and profit-boosting camps was storming. The prime change agent was McDonnell Douglas chief Harry Stonecipher, a 27-year GE veteran, who became Condit’s number two. Son of a Tennessee coal miner, Stonecipher expressed admiration of President Harry Truman for his decision to use nuclear weapons versus Japan. (Stonecipher famously loved delivering his variation on a quote from Truman: “I give ’em hell and tell them the truth, and they think it’s hell!”) Most of all, Stonecipher was a hawk on raising shareholder value and pushing down costs. He rallied the troops to be “less of a family and more of a team.”', 'Prior to the early 2000s, Boeing had built most key portions of its planes in-house, from fuselages to landing gear. As an internal debate raged over whether to embrace a new, low-cost outsourcing model, a Boeing engineer named John Hart-Smith presented a white paper arguing that the new, decentralized approach risked not providing sufficient on-site technical support and quality control of contractors. “The manufacturer is only as good as the least good of its suppliers. Costs don’t go down, because the risks are out of sight,” wrote Hart-Smith.', 'As president, Stonecipher—backed strongly by new director Jim McNerney, another GE alumnus—pushed for a new, “clean sheet” wide-body that Boeing could build at far lower cost than its previous version, the 777. Both Boeing and Airbus had long deployed subcontractors, though both built the major systems in-house. But for the 787, Boeing launched not just a new aircraft, but an entirely original business model. It signed “partners” who contributed billions toward the project in advance, in exchange for long-term contracts for supplying\xa0the key portions of the aircraft. Among the recruits were GE for engines, Rockwell Collins for traffic alert systems, and Spirit AeroSystems for fuselages. The new paradigm, management reckoned, would allow the planemaker to move quickly so that it wouldn’t lose orders to the forthcoming Airbus A380. By contrast, Airbus didn’t need partners for funding. It regularly secured its development backing for new models from the French and German governments.', 'In the 787 program, Boeing radically altered its flight plan and diverged from its chief rival by adopting a less capital-intensive model and focusing more strongly on where it could add the greatest value, in hatching the overall design and providing final assembly.', 'But the 787 “partnering” approach required a totally different manufacturing blueprint from Boeing’s use of subcontractors in the past. “The 787 set Boeing on its ear,” says Richard Safran, a former aerospace engineer at Northrop Grumman who’s now an analyst at Seaport Research Partners. “Boeing was saying to its suppliers, ‘You design the part or section, and tell us how you’ll build it. You need to do integration work. Now all the suppliers are mini-Boeings. They’re suddenly investing in design and engineering work, not just making the parts Boeing designed for them. It was hard for Boeing to control quality in that system, and it still is.” For Safran, Boeing never lost its talent for topflight engineering. The problem was that starting with Stonecipher, its CEOs layered on an obsession with hammering down expenses that conflicted with Boeing tradition and sowed confusion. “The cost culture was the culprit,” he says. “It started with Stonecipher, and his successors executed on it.”', 'The 787 Dreamliner, and Boeing’s embrace of outsourcing, had a rocky takeoff. The plane was three years late when the airlines got their first deliveries in 2011. For several years, Boeing booked losses on each Dreamliner that rolled out from the assembly plants near Charleston, S.C., and in Everett. The extra costs ballooning from the contractors’ design miscues and production delays, along with Boeing’s errors in assembling systems made in Japan, South Korea, Italy, France, and Sweden, meant that all the outsourcing that was supposed to reap big savings backfired. In a 2011 speech, top Boeing executive Jim Albaugh stated that it never would have experienced those huge overruns if it had kept the technology closer to Boeing.', 'Still, the 787 proved a massive hit. “Boeing was brilliant in introducing a plane that flew direct routes and had extremely long range, while Airbus competed with the A380 that was a hub-and-spoke plane,” says Safran. “The 787 won. The airlines wanted a plane that had longer range and flew point to point.” McNerney and the new chief of the 787 program, Pat Shanahan, recently named CEO of Boeing’s troubled supplier Spirit AeroSystems, in 2008 camped out at the Everett plant and managed to get production flowing smoothly.', 'But for McNerney, the lingering losses the 787 generated made it essential for Boeing to escalate its war on costs. In 2011, he introduced a now-notorious initiative called “Partnering for Success” that consisted of pressuring all contractors to lower their prices, generally in the range of 10% to 15%, or even more. Those who refused often got placed on a “no-fly list” that barred them from bidding on new programs. McNerney declared that it was “out of kilter” for suppliers to reap bigger margins than Boeing. McNerney threatened to bring production of wings and other key systems in-house as a lever to garner reductions. “He kept toggling back and forth between saying suppliers are incompetent, and that we have to push out more and more business to suppliers,” says a former executive at one of Boeing’s large contractors. “Both are incorrect. You need to rely on suppliers whenever they can do things better than you can, at competitive cost.” McNerney was known both inside Boeing and by suppliers as a big picture strategist not deeply involved on the operating side. He enraged the rank and file by stating in 2014 that he wouldn\'t retire at 65 because ""the heart will still be beating, employees will still be cowering.""', 'In the period starting around 2011, Boeing started revving on all engines. The 787 dominated wide-body sales, and the 737 Max series, which began collecting orders in 2011 and featured the fuel-efficient GE LEAP engine, also proved a big hit, garnering huge orders from American, United, and Southwest. In 2015, Muilenburg replaced McNerney in the pilot’s seat, and continued the strong focus on lowering costs and delivering big shareholder returns. From the close of 2010 through 2018, Boeing’s financial performance was extraordinary. In that eight-year span, it multiplied its free cash flow sixfold, and its stock vaulted from $70 to $425. It posted total annual returns of 29.5%, waxing Microsoft (21.7%), Apple (19.6%), and Alphabet (18.0%). Those results demonstrate how profitable Boeing can be when not beset by quality failings.', 'But the eight-year run of fantastic profits was brought to a halt by the two tragic crashes in 2018 and 2019, caused by the faulty design of a new flight control software system that repeatedly pushed down the nose of the then-new 737-8 Max. Those disasters exposed the problems that had been lurking for years. And Ed Pierson witnessed firsthand the simmer building to a boil.', 'Pierson, a former Naval flight officer, worked as a senior manager on the Renton factory floor from 2015 to late 2018 during this boom period. Today, he’s executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a newly created nonprofit, and in 2019, he testified before Congress as a whistleblower, warning of potential manufacturing safety issues on the Max that he witnessed developing on the job. Those issues had everything to do with the toxic combination of a complex network of suppliers colliding with soaring demand for new planes. “The CFM LEAP-1B engines would come in late,” Pierson told Fortune. “So the planes would move down the assembly line to the next station missing engines and other parts. The workers farther back on the line had to rush down the line with their tools and interrupt the workers at the later stage to install the parts scheduled to be installed days before. That out-of-sequence work is a dangerous practice.”', 'He also claims that Boeing changed its inspection protocols to raise the pace. Part of the change, he says, involved laying off experienced quality control inspectors, and in lieu of the human inspections relying on a combination of “modern inspection technologies,” random statistical analysis, and more reliance on self-inspections by assembly-line workers. He notes that inspections were lowered, not eliminated. “In 2018, on weekends, we’d bring on hundreds of manufacturing employees on overtime, and we’d have less quality inspectors than we used to have, and those that remained were very overworked.”', 'In addition, says Pierson, Boeing did an inadequate job fixing problems identified by frontline workers. “The reality is that when workers would speak up, sometimes they weren’t listened to at all,” he observes.\xa0“Most times, they were listened to, but that didn’t solve the problem. The people they informed tried to resolve those issues, but they often didn’t get fixed, because Boeing didn’t supply the resources or capacity to do what was needed.” Concludes Pierson, “It was obviously a dangerously unstable operation. The culture on the factory floor was, ‘This is production. You need to get your job done.’”', 'Boeing has stated publicly that although it announced plans to lay off 900 inspectors in early 2019, it didn’t implement the plan, and has increased the number of quality inspectors 20% since 2019.', 'After the second crash, Muilenburg acted as if shareholders, not passengers and airlines, were his core constituency. He declared that planes’ safety systems were “designed properly” and that the pilots didn’t “completely” follow the procedures Boeing had outlined to prevent the malfunctions that cost the 346 lives. The comments didn’t sit well with the FAA. Then, in late 2019, Muilenburg publicly speculated that the FAA would return the Max to service by December of that year, further riling the agency. “I had to rein that in; I had him to my office,” Stephen Dickson, who served as FAA chief from 2019 to 2022, told Fortune. “I told Dennis, ‘This doesn’t help that you’re putting out projections on what’s an FAA decision. We’re in the driver’s seat.’ Dennis was over his skis on some significant cultural issues. They needed a change.” Eleven days later, the Boeing board fired Muilenburg.', 'Dickson cites that after the crashes, Boeing—in cooperation with the FAA—started implementing a new protocol called Safety Management System that encourages the line workers to report any quality issues and other safety concerns, and for Boeing to more systematically troubleshoot areas of risk around the production process. The FAA also removed Boeing’s ability to independently approve the issuance of “airworthiness certificates” that allow planes to be released for delivery, and mandated that the agency inspectors provide all sign-offs. Following the Portland incident, the FAA multiplied the number of inspectors on-site in Renton. Since the Portland blowout, Calhoun has strongly emphasized in meetings with frontline workers the importance of their speaking up on quality and safety issues.', 'Boeing’s shift to dependence on suppliers heightened the wave of defects that have brought so many delays, as well as steep losses, over the past half-decade. A case in point: the travails of a giant Boeing supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, manufacturer of the fuselages for both of Boeing’s bestselling series, the 737 and 787. For almost 80 years, Boeing owned the facility in Wichita where Spirit now makes those giant cigar-shaped systems. But in 2005, it sold the Wichita facility to private equity firm Onex of Canada, which took Spirit public in late 2006, and deployed acquisitions to greatly expand its suite of products and systems. “The idea was, ‘This big supplier is no longer part of Boeing, so it can also make systems for Airbus, Bombardier, and others, and hence the arrangement lowers the part of the overhead Boeing has to pay,” says Safran. “But Boeing keeps a tight relationship with a trusted contractor. It was all part and parcel of Boeing’s cost reduction initiative.”', 'But the grounding of the 737 Max following the fatal crashes, and a walloping from the pandemic, forced Spirit to lay off thousands of experienced production and inspection personnel. Its stock dropped almost 70% from late 2019 to the close of 2023, and it bled $1.9 billion in free cash flow. Spirit’s troubles boomeranged to plague Boeing. Starting in the fall of 2020 and into 2023, Boeing and its suppliers found quality problems, including defects in fuselages and other parts that delayed deliveries for years. Just last year, Boeing discovered mis-drilled and misaligned holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of the Max, part of the fuselages made by Spirit, that, unless corrected, could cause cracks in the bulkhead. Boeing and its suppliers corrected all problems, but the extensive rework plagued Boeing with delays and added costs.', 'In October, Spirit’s CEO abruptly resigned. His replacement: None other than Pat Shanahan, the 31-year Boeing veteran who’d helped rescue the 787 by swooping down on the Everett plant to smooth the production snafus. The same month, Boeing provided Spirit a sweeping financial aid package that includes an immediate cash infusion of $100 million for capital investment in tooling, and an increase in what Boeing will pay Spirit for 787 parts over the next two years of $455 million.', 'An anonymous whistleblower stated that during final assembly of the 737, Boeing removed the door plug to make repairs, but put it back in place without replacing any of the four bolts, so that the bolts “were not installed when Boeing delivered the plane. Our own records reflect this.” According to the whistleblower, two defect reporting systems failed, so that they never alerted Boeing quality inspectors to examine and sign off on the plug. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report, issued on Feb. 6, confirmed that Boeing workers had removed the panels’ bolts and that the bolts were missing at the time of the accident. As the whistleblower characterized it, Boeing’s production process was “a rambling, shambling disaster waiting to happen.”', 'The outcome Boeing, its investors, and its customers fear most: a repeat of the delays that have saddled the manufacturer with giant stockpiles of planes waiting for delivery. The problem that triggered $16.7 billion in losses from 2019 to 2021 was the huge overhang of airliners Boeing was carrying in inventory. How did it accumulate that burden? Even after the first crash in 2018, Boeing kept producing planes at high speed to fulfill orders, even though the FAA’s grounding of all Max aircraft made it impossible to deliver them. It even cleared employee parking lots for storage. Then, all the quality problems, plus new FAA design requirements, and routine maintenance on aircraft stored for many months delayed delivery once the FAA approved the Max for flight at the end of 2020. Today, Boeing is still holding a gigantic 200 Max and 50 787s in inventory. The vast majority of these planes sit in what Boeing calls “shadow factories,” where they’re undergoing heavy and expensive maintenance and rework. As Calhoun put it on the Q4 earnings call, “We still have a hangover from not being able to deliver planes. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place.”', 'The blowout over Portland doesn’t restrict Boeing from delivering those planes, and Calhoun predicts that Boeing will send virtually all the excess aircraft to their owners by year-end. Chinese airlines have begun taking delivery on 85 Max that, caught in the trade war with the U.S., have waited parked since 2019. Even at the current low levels of production, Boeing generated a substantial $4.4 billion in free cash flow for 2023. Calhoun predicts that it can raise that number to $10 billion by 2025 or 2026, almost the average in the glory times of 2016 to 2018, and still proceed slowly and cautiously. Investors cheered Boeing’s results for Q4, 2023, lifting its share price over the following week by 5% to $211. J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman doesn’t think that Boeing can rebound that fast, but still posits $8.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025.', 'But financial projections won’t fix the culture issues that allowed these problems to fester. Despite his disillusioning times there, Pierson is wistful about his years in Renton. “Before working in production, I worked in flight testing at Boeing Field in Seattle, with a group of exceptional professionals that benefited from solid leadership. My boss’s call sign as Navy pilot was ‘Saint,’ and rightly so, everyone loved working with the guy,” recalls Pierson. “Then, the leadership changed, and it wasn’t nearly as wonderful. People were less encouraged to speak up about problems. It’s all about leadership. Organization A has a great leader, then another leader comes in, and the organization falters.”', 'Pierson says that every top executive and board member at Boeing should ask themselves one crucial question to determine if they’re providing the right leadership. “The simple test is, ‘In 2023, how many times did you spend time on the factory floor and listen to the concerns of the employees who are the backbone of the company?’ If the answer is ‘no,’ you’re clearly not the right person for the job.”', 'But Pierson says that the culture of safety can spread through the entire company if Boeing gets the kind of leadership that once inspired the flight testing crew, leadership where the C-suite walks the factory floor, and that cherishes the expertise, and insists on getting facts and guidance from the folks who hand-make these extraordinary flying machines. In other words, Boeing can get its wings level, but only if the frontline workers have a hand on the joystick.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

If you want to skip our discussion on the electric utility industry, head directly to 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Right Now.\xa0', 'In the face of a continuously changing energy landscape, US utilities maintain three primary objectives according to Ernst & Young (EY) – ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. The utilities sector in 2024 requires a careful balance between conventional and innovative funding approaches to advance these priorities. Presently, utility executives are better equipped than ever to decisively navigate the transformative decisions required for the future. Initial focus should be on three primary opportunities – (1) Strengthening the balance sheet to support investment strategies that generate enduring value for stakeholders, (2) Optimizing newly accessible capital, such as grants and tax credits, to expedite the energy transition for power and utility companies, and (3) Upgrading technology to advance business operations.', 'In 2023, the US power and utilities industry experienced advancements in decarbonization, increased deployment of solar power and energy storage, and improved grid reliability. As per a recent Deloitte report, the sector faced mixed fundamentals, with a slight decrease in electricity sales due to mild weather. Wholesale electricity prices dropped in response to lower natural gas costs, but high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, coupled with rising interest rates, contributed to potential customer bill increases. The industry also grappled with costs related to disaster recovery, cybersecurity, and climate-related challenges. Despite lower fuel costs, retail electricity prices were projected to increase by 1.9% year-over-year, with residential prices potentially rising by 4.7%. In 2024, electricity prices are expected to stabilize, with a forecasted 2% increase in sales. The industry may focus on electrification, resource adequacy, and addressing rising costs, exploring the potential use of AI, including generative AI, to tackle challenges.\xa0', ""In 2023, utilities faced a decline as investor preference shifted from defensive stocks to mega-cap growth companies, particularly in the technology and communication services sectors. This led to utilities being one of the weakest-performing sectors in the S&P 500. However, by late 2023, utilities stocks experienced significantly lower valuations, trading at one of the largest discounts to the S&P in the past two decades, according to a Fidelity report. The utility sector's near-term performance may continue to be influenced by investor sentiment and economic conditions in 2024. If the economy maintains a soft landing with strong growth and low inflation, utilities may remain out of favor. Conversely, in the face of economic weakness, investors could turn back to defensive stocks like utilities, known for stability, durable cash flows, and dividends, especially during market volatility. A decline in interest rates could further benefit utility stocks by making their dividends more attractive compared to bonds. "", 'Looking at the longer term, utilities are positioned at the center of the shift from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to accelerate this transition by providing incentives for the adoption of clean-energy options and reducing greenhouse gasses. Consumers, businesses, and governments are actively working to decrease their carbon footprints, and forecasts suggest a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'Some of the best electric utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

Demand for military drones have surged over the last few years with countries actively using their unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target operations.', 'Drones were a prominent feature of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and have been clouding the skies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Borodyanka among other towns and cities in Ukraine, in what is being seen as the arrival of a new threat in the aerial defense space. These uninhabited aerial vehicles have made it difficult for enemy targets to move and hide on the battlefield with their aerial footages offering unprecedented birds-eye views of the war.', 'The Americans have been operating drones for about a century now, having deployed them first during World War II, between 1939 and 1945, and then more recently in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. Defense experts believe the proliferation of military drones is a concern for US policymakers who worry about China taking a leaf out of Russia’s book (strikes on Ukraine), and launching similar attacks against US interests in the Pacific. Moreover, US troops have also come under drone attacks from non-state actors in the Middle East in recent years – most notably from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.', 'Considering the rapidly evolving threat, the Americans are taking initiatives to stay a step ahead of their foes. In August 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced to build ‘attritable autonomous systems’ in mass over the next two years.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Northrop Grumman is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Northrop Grumman, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.1%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term."", 'You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>', 'The upgrade of Northrop Grumman to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But S&P’s Amanda O’Neill and Sarah Wyeth also said that “VF's financial policies and actions show commitment to investment-grade ratings.”"", ""They expect declines at VF's four major brands — The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Dickies — to persist and “believe VF will have to sell sizeable brands to meaningfully reduce leverage in the near term.” They noted the company’s $6 billion debt burden and said that must be cut by almost $4 billion to hit its targets."", 'VF’s wholesale issues stand out even amid wider weakness in that channel. And the 8% decline in its direct-to-consumer business “further highlights brand issues beyond Vans,” they also said.', 'A year ago, VF Corp. was looking to The North Face for guidance in turning around its other labels, particularly Vans.', '“The North Face is a solid and transferable execution blueprint for Vans, and frankly, the entire VF portfolio in the Americas, where we must grow with consumers more consistently,” then-interim CEO Benno Dorer told analysts.', 'Now even its top performer shows signs of struggle, joining its other three major brands in posting double-digit declines in Q3: Vans fell 28%, Timberland 21%, Dickies 16% and The North Face 10%.', '“The North Face has been a bright spot in the VF portfolio but declined 10% for the quarter due to timing shifts, warmer weather, and a decline in demand for outdoor products,” the S&P analysts noted.', ""They see slow progress at Vans in the near term amid ongoing wholesale weakness in North America and intensifying competition, and “believe the brand's waning resonance with consumers will continue to hamper turnaround efforts in fiscal 2025,” they wrote."", 'That will likely add to its debt woes. S&P forecasts the company’s leverage will peak this fiscal year, which ends in March, as it incurs expenses as part of its cost-cutting strategy amid falling sales. Late last year, VF Corp. eliminated about 500 salaried positions across the company globally, part of an effort to slash $300 million in expenses.', 'S&P now forecasts VF revenues to decline 10%, worse than its previous expectation for 6%, and for EBITDA margin to decline 200 basis points year over year. Their rating could decline further if “VF does not restore its core brands to growth or is not successful in divesting certain assets and using proceeds to reduce debt,” the analysts said. Several risks remain, including the macroeconomic environment and, particularly at Vans, any “fashion missteps or changing consumer tastes.”', 'The company could also run into trouble if it pursues a major acquisition, per S&P, though that seems unlikely given its circumstances. VF Corp. for years has revamped its portfolio time and again, with its biggest purchase its $2.1 billion acquisition of cult brand Supreme about three years ago.', '“At this time, we believe VF remains committed to a conservative financial policy and will abstain from mergers and acquisitions,” the S&P analysts said.', 'Selling off brands is another story.\xa0The company’s debt-reduction needs suggest that one or two of its major brands must be sold, according to the S&P analysts. Indeed, CEO Bracken Darrell earlier this month announced a strategic review of the company’s assets, and some analysts speculated then that Dickies or Timberland would be most likely to go.', 'But that isn’t risk-free, either, S&P analysts warned.', '“While this will allow the company to reduce its high debt burden faster, it also reduces its brand diversity and puts more pressure on the remaining underperforming brands to turn around,” they said.', 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

The index actually has been in this positive market phase ever since it started recovering from its bear market low about 16 months ago -- and since bull markets generally last longer than bear markets, investors should have plenty of time to benefit from this one."", ""How to get the most out of a bull market? By investing in stocks with solid growth prospects. That's because these environments usually support growth companies as well as those that are ramping up for a new wave of growth ahead. Today, the market offers plenty of opportunities, but Motley Fool contributors Adria Cimino and Keith Speights have zeroed in on two compelling healthcare players: biotech company Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) and big pharma Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). So which makes the better bull market buy now?"", 'Adria Cimino (Novavax): Novavax wowed investors when it soared by more than 2,700% back in 2020 as investors bet on its ability to bring an effective coronavirus vaccine to market. The company fulfilled that promise, but its vaccine entered the market much later than expected -- at least one year after rivals for its initial launch, and even later in other countries.', 'As a result, Novavax missed out on the biggest vaccine revenue opportunity, and the stock progressively dropped by about 98% from its peak. Today, it trades for close to the same price it sported at the start of 2020.', ""But Novavax's growth story may not be over. Last year, the biotech put into place a cost-reduction and efficiency plan to help it match its cost structure to its revenue opportunities today and down the road. Novavax has made significant progress already, and it aims to bring its expenses below $750 million this year. The efforts should help it strengthen the company financially, and position it to advance its combined coronavirus/flu candidate through development."", 'The combined candidate -- which Novavax hopes to launch in 2026 -- could be a big growth driver, more easily gaining adoption than a stand-alone COVID-19 vaccine. The idea is that many of the people who get annual flu shots -- and that group includes almost half of the U.S. adult population -- may favor a single shot that protects them against two viruses. The combined candidate has generated positive data in clinical trials, and the company aims to launch a phase 3 trial this year.', ""Meanwhile, Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine continues to bring in revenue, even if at lower levels than vaccines did in the earlier stages of the pandemic."", 'Novavax still carries a good deal of risk as an investment. The company is on the road to recovery, but any setbacks would weigh heavily on share performance. The company also is involved in a dispute, currently in arbitration, with a major customer -- Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. That adds to the uncertainties.', 'But if Novavax surmounts the challenges and progresses with its combined vaccine candidate, its shares could skyrocket, especially in an environment favoring growth.', ""Keith Speights (Pfizer): I'll readily admit that Pfizer looks like a horrible choice to invest in at first glance. Its revenue and earnings have fallen significantly due to sinking demand for its COVID-19 products. It faces patent expirations for several top-selling drugs over the next few years. And it has lost more than half its market cap since late 2021. However, I believe the case for Pfizer is stronger than you might think."", 'The big drugmaker still has several growth drivers in its lineup, notably including migraine therapy Nurtec and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Abrysvo. Pfizer expects that new drugs and new approvals for existing drugs will generate an additional $20 billion or so in annual revenue by 2030. That should be more than enough to offset the anticipated sales declines resulting from patent expirations.', ""Pfizer has also been busy making strategic acquisitions. Since 2022, the company has bought Arena Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Global Blood Therapeutics, and Seagen. Management expects these and other business development deals will boost the company's annual revenue by close to $25 billion by 2030."", ""I wouldn't write off Pfizer's COVID-19 prospects, either. The company is evaluating a combination COVID/flu vaccine in late-stage clinical trials that could open up new opportunities if approved."", ""In the meantime, Pfizer's shares are dirt cheap, trading at a forward earnings multiple of only 12.4. The stock also offers a juicy dividend yield of over 6% at the current share price. I think the combination of this solid dividend with improving growth prospects should enable Pfizer to deliver market-beating total returns over the next several years."", 'Novavax and Pfizer both have been traversing difficult times, and both have plans to spur growth. If all goes well, they each could win in this new bull market.', ""But which is the better buy? This depends on your comfort with risk. Cautious investors would be better off going with Pfizer, which has demonstrated its staying power and ability to grow a multibillion-dollar portfolio over the years. But aggressive investors who don't mind accepting more risk may want to give Novavax a try. That's because if Novavax reaches its goals, the biotech offers greater potential for explosive gains."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Novavax right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Novavax, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novavax wasn’t one of them.

The company experienced a 42% decrease in revenue last year as revenue from its COVID-19 products diminished.

Pfizer is planning to save $4 billion in expenses through a ""cost realignment"" program. ', ""Overall, there is some risk with Pfizer's dividend but it isn't overly concerning. The company is in the midst of a transition away from COVID-19 products and its recent acquisition of oncology company Seagen also means that it will need to trim some costs related to that purchase. This has the potential to be an underrated buy as Pfizer's stock is trading at a fairly modest 12 times its estimated future profits.

On an annual basis, Enbridge pays CA$3.66 in dividends per share. If you were filtering out stocks with payout ratios in excess of 100%, you could end up skipping this stock, and that could be a mistake.', ""In Enbridge's case, the company incurs significant depreciation expenses as it is an asset-heavy business, and that can often make its earnings look underwhelming. But it and many other oil and gas stocks rely on distributable cash flow (DCF) to help assess the safety of their payouts. This is a calculation that more closely resembles cash flow than accounting profits. Last year, the company's DCF of CA$11.3 billion rose by CA$0.3 billion from 2022. With 2.1 billion shares outstanding, that puts its DCF per share at around CA$5.30. "", 'Enbridge has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years and is one of the safer oil and gas stocks for income investors to rely on. Its high payout ratio is misleading as this can be an excellent dividend stock to buy and hold.', 'Tobacco company Philip Morris International pays a dividend that yields 5.8%, which is also well above the S&P 500 average. For 2023, its diluted EPS of $5.02 came in less than its current annualized dividend rate of $5.20 per share. ', ""This company's net revenue of $35.2 billion rose by an impressive rate of nearly 11%. But Philip Morris' operating income totaled $11.6 billion and fell by 6% as the company incurred many expenses related to impairment, acquisitions, and geopolitical issues. Its adjusted operating income of $13.3 billion rose by 3%. "", ""Philip Morris' dividend may appear to be sustainable for now, but this is the riskiest payout on the list. The company faces an uncertain future as it still relies heavily on cigarettes. Last year, Philip Morris' cigarette shipments were down 1.4% but still totaled 612.9 billion versus 125.3 billion for heated tobacco units. And the jury's still out on just how much safer heated tobacco products are than cigarettes.

And you've alleged in the suit that even before this joint venture was announced, that you believe these companies have had a clear agenda that would be-- not advantageous to FuboTV. What is that agenda?"", ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, it's pretty simple. You're seeing the impact of Netflix on these businesses, their inability to compete. And so, I think the way they look at us, and have looked at us for years, is, basically, how do we marginalize this company to ensure that we don't find ourselves, you know, several years from when we launched in a situation where we now have a Netflix of sports or, you know, a more niche bundle that we have to deal with?"", ""And so they have utilized pernicious MFNs to distort pricing. They forced us to bundle content in the hundreds of millions of dollars of cost to us that customers didn't really want. And then they come up with this brilliant idea of, hey, we want to attract customers that are not interested in this sort of larger bundle."", 'So, when you put all of that together, and the aggressive fees that are well-- grossly above market, actually, you end up having a service that has basically taxed customers a ridiculous amount of money over time. And so, my view here is very simple, that there are significant monetary reparations in order here.', ""And we will gladly return those to customers, anything that we're able to gain in the form of promotions and discounts going forward.

And all we ever wanted to do was to compete on equal terms, but that has been proven to be impossible."", 'SEANA SMITH: David, when it comes to pricing, you quickly mentioned that there-- I guess how significantly do you see bundling tactics like this eventually raising prices for the consumer?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Well, I mean, one of the worst things about this and, you know, again, I'm not a legal expert, but to me, this is almost borderline racketeering. Because what's happening in the industry is that, you know, the media companies are saying, look, if you want the full bundle, go get a paid TV subscription. And at the same time, they're taking certain pieces of content out of the bundle to force a consumer to get that one extra game or two extra games to pay for another service."", ""So they're basically double paying in more than, I would say, 30% to 50% of cases for the same content.

Well, I'm glad you brought that up. I mean, you know, this is not something new, right? You're talking about media companies that own their own distribution. And as I said, they distort pricing to us. This is something that we've been dealing with for nine years."", ""And, you know, if you look back historically, obviously, I can't comment on the current quarter or 2023 full year, but what I will say is looking backward, is that we have done a tremendous job in being very efficient. We've met or exceeded guidance, I would say, 13 or 12 to 13 times out of the last 14 or 15 quarters. We have improved-- we beat consensus three times on the bottom line."", ""And, you know, we're continuing to march down our path to achieve profitability, regardless, in 2025. But we shouldn't have to do it in such a way where they block us in every possible opportunity to grow our business. Frankly, there are significant damages here because we have not been able to compete fairly with a group of companies that they put us in, which is with Hulu."", ""We've not been able to package in the same way. We don't have access to ESPN+. And so, you know, but we still believe that we're on track with respect to our 2025 plan, again, based off of the last quarter numbers that we provided in November."", ""SEANA SMITH: David, just pushing back just a bit, because I think you could, or people out there could, make the argument that, hey, this industry is more competitive than it had been a decade ago, two decades ago when you have the entrance of many of these larger tech giants. They are now on the playing field there. What's your response to that argument? The fact that it's not just anymore about some of these legacy players."", ""DAVID GANDLER: But it is, because if you think about what they've done, they've weaponized an American institution, which is the NFL. You cannot-- at least in my view, is they have these rights for the next eight to nine years going into 2030."", ""So, when you control 100% of the National Hockey League rights, national television rights, and 100%, at least as of today, the national NBA rights, 50% of NFL and college football, you're basically dealing with a group of companies that are controlling for now, at least, and for the foreseeable future, this industry, with a goal of colluding and ensuring that they maintain that type of control. What's interesting to me is, and I'm sure you would agree with this, is that no longer can they consider merging because that, obviously, would be a non-starter for any DOJ to consider."", ""So therefore, this is the next best option. Let's circumvent merging and just collude via this, I'll call it-- because they haven't named it yet, so I'll name it for you guys, which is sports cartel TV-- to really marginalize players like Fubo."", 'BRAD SMITH: This feels like a reversion back to some of the cable bundles that we had known in the past, but on streaming grounds. And I would love to know how consumers should perceive these partnerships that are moving forward?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, I mean, if you look back to my shareholder letter of 2021-- I believe it's actually exactly maybe three years ago-- I said we were going to move from bundling to unbundling, to the eventual rebundling, of this content. We have conducted numerous surveys. We collect 2 billion data points a month."", ""And basically, what we found is that consumers, three out of four consumers prefer to watch content on an aggregated app versus a direct-to-consumer app. And I think these media companies are learning the hard way-- tens of billions of dollars of losses that they're asking us to subsidize-- that it doesn't work and that the churn rates are too high, the marketing costs are too high, the tech costs are too high. And so the only way to do this is to really stomp out competition."", ""And I think consumers should be very nervous about this because I think, historically, we've seen this playbook. Whether it's with email or with any other services, they start out either free or cheap. And very quickly, if you look at the compounded annual growth rates in terms of pricing for any services, you'll see how quickly they ramp up once they start to feel comfortable in a market."", ""So this is very bad for customers. They should really be upset about this. They should be worried about it. And, you know, we've set up a landing page, savemysports.com, really asking people to read the letter that we put out there to support free choice and competition.

Experian (EXPN.L) was saying that buy now, pay later transactions, those payments will show up on your credit report, however, it does not get factored into your score at this time.

With that in mind, we're taking a look here about what providers report to credit bureaus. It's not the same across the industry."", ""To break it down for us, Venessa Wong, MarketWatch reporter, is here. Thank you for joining us, Venessa. So I'm looking at your article here because there does seem to be some misperceptions here around the impact of buy now, pay later services, whether they help or hurt your credit. Break some of that down for us."", ""VENESSA WONG: It's really interesting. So there was a new New York Fed report that was saying there are some consumers who are turning to buy now, pay later services, thinking that it will help them build credit, which at this point, is still not true. And that's because buy now, pay later providers typically are not reporting their users' payment data to the credit bureaus."", ""It's inconsistent. There are not standard rules right now for how any of this data is treated. So I reached out to the large buy now, pay later companies. Klarna says that they don't report anything to the credit bureaus. Afterpay also doesn't report anything to the credit bureaus."", 'Affirm reports some, but not all data to the credit bureaus and not to all the credit bureaus. So there is, at this point, still sort of like a Motley landscape in terms of how buy now, pay later data is dealt with. So specifically, a firm reports monthly installment payments to Experian, but it does not report payments for its pay-in-four plan, in which your total balance is split into four payments to any of the credit bureaus.', ""Once it gets to the credit bureaus, how they deal with it is also not standard, so I can go into that a little bit if it makes sense. TransUnion says it doesn't-- TransUnion was saying it doesn't--"", ""- It doesn't help your credit, but does it hurt your credit if you don't make those payments in time? Because that's always been a bit of a concern, as well. Where do you take hit?"", ""VENESSA WONG: At this point, it does not show up in your credit score. So Experian was saying that buy now, pay later transactions, those payments will show up on your credit report. However, it does not get factored into your score at this time. So it won't, at this time, help or hurt you. If you're not making your payments on time, though, you do have your debt snowballing, which creates other problems."", ""- So, Venessa, then, in terms of financial education about this, how much of that falls on some of these companies? How much of that is clear when people are making these purchases of what they're getting into, especially for some of the ones that offer interest like a firm, depending on the size of your payments here? How much do people actually know about what they're getting into?"", ""VENESSA WONG: I think because buy now, pay later is still a relatively new service, there's still a lot of confusion about what is going on. And I think because there are different payment plans, for example, with a firm having a monthly installment payment plan or pay-in-four payment plan, which is dealt with differently in terms of how it's reported to the credit bureaus, it's just rather confusing."", ""So there are consumer advocates who believe that using a credit card which has established reporting standards with the credit bureaus that most people-- many people are used to how they're dealt with, which actually do help you build credit if you're making on-time payments is a better option for folks who are trying to build their credit."", '- Well, certainly appreciate you joining to clarify some of that for us. I know a lot of people are using it for things like-- even small things like groceries, so certainly, important to see how those things add up and affect credit. I appreciate you joining us, Venessa Wong, MarketWatch reporter. Thank you so much.', 'VENESSA WONG: Thank you very much.']"

This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.', 'For Molson Coors, I see four beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last year. The average positive earnings surprise over the last year works out to be a positive 37.2%.', 'Earnings estimates revisions is what the Zacks Rank is all about.', 'Following the most recent quarter estimates have trended higher.', 'The consensus estimate for the current quarter has increased from 68 cents to 71 cents.', 'Next quarter has seen the consensus move from $1.72 to $1.76.', 'The full fiscal year 2024 estimate has moved from $5.41 to $5.66', 'Next year has moved from $5.58 to $5.96.', 'The forward PE multiple for TAP is just a hair below 11x and that is rather low considering the 6% topline growth that was posted in the most recent quarter.

The price to sales multiple comes out at just a little below 1x.', 'KnightSwift Transportation is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as earnings estimates have tracked lower due following a recent earnings miss. The company is in trucking and transportation industry and could be interesting to some investors at these levels.

This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.', 'In the case of KnightSwift Transportation, I see one beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and three misses. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.', 'The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.', 'The Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For KNX I see annual estimates moving lower of late.', 'The current year (2024) consensus number moved lower from $3.10 to $2.52 over the last 60 days.', 'The next year moved from $4.44 to $4.25 over the last 60 days.', 'Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).', 'It should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).', 'The housing market in the United States hit a roadblock recently after the Federal Reserve signaled that the central bank might not trim interest rates in the March policy meeting, while mortgage rates continue to edge up amid steady economic growth, a healthy labor market and elevated price pressures.', 'A March Fed rate cut is likely off the table since inflation hasn’t yet moved sustainably toward the central bank’s desired target of 2%. Needless to say, interest rate cuts reduce the cost of buying a house, which upsurges the demand for housing.', 'On the other hand, mortgage rates are inching up, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 6.77% as of Feb 15. It is up 13 basis points from the previous week. Now, higher mortgage rates lead to higher borrowing costs, thereby discouraging a potential buyer from purchasing a house due to higher monthly payments.', 'However, home-builder confidence surged in February since the housing industry expects the Fed to eventually cut interest rates later this year, which would bolster demand for homes. Homebuilders also expect mortgage rates to, sooner or later, drop and that could lead to more buyers entering the housing market amid pent-up demand.', 'The monthly confidence index of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) went up 4 points to 48 in February, its highest level since August. The home-builder confidence index rose for the third consecutive month and easily exceeded economists’ expectations of a reading of 46. The index was at 42, a year ago.', 'Homebuilders remain confident about present sales conditions. They are also hopeful about future sales, and expect an increase in traffic of potential buyers. Economic activity, by the way, has already improved in the housing market, with construction outlays increasing for the twelfth straight month in December.', 'Per the Commerce Department, construction spending increased 0.9% to $2.1 trillion in December as the government ramped up construction projects across the length and breadth of the country.', 'Thus, with the housing market warming up, it is judicious for investors to place their bets on sound home-builders such as Toll Brothers, NVR and Century Communities for handsome returns.

Employees are looking for pay raises that account for inflation, along with more access to health care and retirement benefits as part of its new three-year contract, according to the Teamsters. Molson Coors, the union claimed, only offered raises of 99 cents an hour in initial negotiations.', 'Sean M. O’Brien, general manager for the Teamsters, said in a statement Molson Coors does not care if its workers can’t afford basic needs and health care.', '“Executives shamelessly brag to investors about the company’s incredible growth and historic earnings. Millions go to the CEO, billions go to Wall Street, and a middle finger goes to the workers,” O’Brien said. “We’re not taking the disrespect, we’re not accepting the crumbs, and we’re not making concessions. The Teamsters are taking this fight to the streets, and we will hold the line until our members get what they have earned.”', 'In a statement to CNN, Molson Coors said it built up inventory ahead of the strike and thus has more capacity at five other facilities.', '“While we respect the union’s right to strike, we have strong contingency plans and are well equipped to ensure consumers will be able to buy their favorite Molson Coors products,” the company told CNN.', 'The strike is halting production for Molson Coors at one of its biggest plants, which produces drinks like Coors Light, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Yuengling. In its earnings call last week, Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley told investors the company’s increased market share in the beer space was “permanent,” pointing to 9.3% net sales growth in its most recent quarter.', 'But the Fort Worth strike may not be the only picketing organized by the Teamsters against a beer giant. The union said earlier this month workers at AB InBev plants may also go on strike after its contract expires on Thursday, Feb. 29, when the company is set to report earnings.', 'Wall Street analysts are taking notice of the labor issues in the beer space. In a note to investors, Neil Churchill of HSBC Global Research said Molson Coors may not be the biggest company the union is targeting, as labor groups often approach a wider industry strike incrementally. A larger strike against AB InBev could impact 5,000 workers, versus the 420 at Molson Coors’ plant, he said.', '“We believe that [AB InBev] could rationalize its plant network with the possible closure of 2-3 breweries in order to match the reality of its current volume output, which may be a major source of tension beyond hourly wages and benefits,” Churchill said. “It looks like a complicated negotiation.”', 'This story was originally published on Food Dive.

The increasing popularity of SUVs is attributed to their perceived functionality for daily use and leisure travel. Safety features and advanced technologies are becoming crucial for SUV appeal, as consumers prioritize vehicles with cutting-edge safety features. The practicality and flexibility of SUVs, offering enhanced visibility, cargo capacity, and a strong road presence, are attracting a diverse range of buyers.', 'Urbanization trends also play a role, as SUVs are seen as suitable city cars with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements such as fuel efficiency, infotainment systems, autonomous driving capabilities, and connectivity are appealing to tech-savvy buyers, while effective marketing strategies by manufacturers highlight the lifestyle and status associated with owning an SUV.', ""Within the broader SUV’s market, electric SUVs are gaining popularity worldwide as countries like China and India focus on reducing vehicle emissions and increasing government support. These electric SUVs offer longer driving ranges, addressing range anxiety, and making them more suitable for daily use. For example, Mercedes-Benz recently introduced its all-electric SUV, the EQE 500 4Matic, in India. Priced at INR 13.9 million, it is the third electric vehicle in the manufacturer's Indian lineup. The company is also providing a 10-year warranty on the EV battery, marking a significant milestone for the brand."", ""The move towards electric vehicles (EVs) presents substantial changes. Traditional cars have a higher number of components compared to electric vehicles, resulting in increased assembly time. The United Auto Workers union is striving for fair wages and job security amidst worries that the transition may put 35,000 jobs at risk out of its 150,000 members due to potential effects on Detroit's 'Big Three' car manufacturers.

We then narrowed down the selection based on the Resale Scores provided by J.D. Power, a reputable authority in automotive data analysis. This Resale Score predicts a vehicle's future depreciation over the next three years, with higher ratings correlating to lower depreciation levels. We then ranked the list based on resale scores.

The optional Off-Road package further enhances its rugged abilities."", 'Resale Score: 81', ""2023 Tesla Model Y, though popular with buyers, and high on the Resale Score, falls short compared to its sedan counterpart, the Model 3. While offering respectable driving range among electric SUVs like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4, the Model Y feels less nimble on twisty roads and lacks the luxurious feel of its upscale competitors. The interior's use of lower-quality materials and reliance on a single infotainment screen may not meet the expectations of those considering luxury electric SUVs from brands like Audi, Cadillac, or Genesis."", 'Resale Score: 82', 'The 2023 Lexus NX distinguishes itself from being just a revamped Toyota RAV4 by offering a luxurious design and a well-appointed cabin.

While the Lexus NX provides a range of powertrain options, including a powerful plug-in hybrid, it may not deliver the same level of driving enjoyment as some of its rivals.

It offers both front-wheel and all-wheel-drive options, with the former boasting a range of up to 252 miles per charge. While the bZ4X joins a competitive group of non-luxury EV SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Ford Mustang Mach E, Hyundai Kona Electric, Kia Niro EV, Tesla Model Y, and Volkswagen ID.4, its real-world highway range in testing reveals it lags behind some of its counterparts in this segment."", 'Resale Score: 84', 'Mazda\'s shift towards SUVs is evident, with the introduction of the 2024 CX-50 showcasing the brand\'s continued commitment to its ""zoom-zoom"" spirit.

The CX-50 satisfies the instinct of exploring without limits with an optional turbocharged engine that provides up to 256 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque, allowing one to explore wherever journey takes them. Competing in the same segment as popular models like the Honda CR-V and Volkswagen Tiguan, the CX-50 also faces competition from its own lineup, notably the Mazda CX-5.

While there is nothing inherently wrong with the market showing such strength, there are a few concerning developments brewing that may lead to at least a minor correction in the coming weeks.', 'Because of these developments, I am turning my focus to some more defensive stocks which I will share here.', 'In the chart below we can see that the Nasdaq 100 has been trading almost perfectly up and to the right for the last three and a half months. But volatility has begun to pick up, and the index has now broken down below the lower bound of this upward trending channel.', 'These channel breakdowns can often be an early signal for more volatility, and so long as the market is below this level, I remain cautious. There is a similar setup in the S&P 500 as well.', 'Part of what powered the stock market rally over the last three months was the growing expectation that the Fed would be cutting interest rates early in 2024. But it seems we may be kicking the can down the road.', 'At the last CPI data release, we learned that inflation was hotter than expected, indicating that there may be some risk of cutting rates too early. Additionally, the employment data has also consistently shown that the labor market is extremely strong.', 'Because it appears that the economy is still in expansion, even with high interest rates, there is very little pressure on the central bank to rush and lower interest rates, and in fact there may be a risk of causing the economy to overheat if they do it too soon.', 'Just a month ago, futures markets were pricing in the first rate cut at the March meeting, and a second rate cut at the May meeting, but both of those are now off the table. This is already a big reversal in interest rate expectations and the ‘higher for longer’ narrative could be a catalyst for a further market selloff.', 'Last year we learned just how influential the seasonal trends of the market can be, as equities followed them almost perfectly all year. If you respect the market’s seasonality, you should be concerned about the next month.', 'The S&P 500 has just entered what is often the most volatile period of the year. Now through mid-March has the potential to bring some considerable selling.', 'A lot of the upside action in markets has been taking place in the high velocity, high growth technology and Artificial Intelligence adjacent stocks. Namely Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Nvidia (NVDA) have made truly stunning moves in just the last six weeks, with SMCI rallying as much as 280%, only to fall more than -30% in just the last week.', 'But there are other cracks forming in these leading sectors. Cloud and cyber security stocks have also been major contributors to the rally, and just this morning, one of the leading names got hit hard. Palo Alto, for instance, got hammered -30% this morning after cutting guidance.', 'The mean reversion occurring in these high momentum stocks has me looking for low-risk, secure, non-cyclical stocks to rotate into.', 'Now all these factors together don’t necessarily mean there is a stock market crash around the corner. The economy is strong, the Fed will be cutting rates later this year, and we are likely in a longer-term bull market that started last year.', 'However, even bull markets can have pullbacks of 5-10%, and for investors looking to get tactically defensive, now is a good time to initiate that plan.', 'One of the first places I like to look for defensive stocks is the healthcare sector. Medical stocks have non-cyclical characteristics, and regularly outperform the market during periods of elevated volatility. Even better if I can find ones that have a top Zacks Rank and are showing relative strength against the market.', 'The two healthcare stocks that I am looking at are HCA Healthcare and DaVita. Both stocks have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings and are industry leading names.', 'HCA Healthcare is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the US and enjoys a steady earnings revisions trend, and reasonable growth estimates in the coming years. Furthermore, the price action in the stock has been forming a convincing bullish pattern.', 'If HCA stock can breakout above the $310 level, it should send it to new highs.', 'DaVita, the country’s leading provider of dialysis care has a very similar setup to HCA Healthcare. In addition to a steady earnings revision trend, and strong EPS growth estimates, the DaVita has a reasonable valuation of 13.7x forward earnings.', 'It also has a clean technical trade setup like HCA. After gapping up following earnings, DaVita stock has been building out a bull flag. A move above the $123.50 level would signal a breakout, and likely draw in buyers.', 'And finally, the last defensive stock pick is General Motors. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, demonstrated by upward trending earnings revisions, the stock has a rock-bottom valuation. General Motors has a one year forward earnings multiple of just 4.3x. And with EPS growth estimates of 9% annually over the next 3-5 years, that gives GM a PEG Ratio of just 0.48x, indicating deep value based on the metric.', 'Like the others, General Motors stock also boasts a clean technical trading setup. Just today, GM stock broke out from a bull flag, and looks primed for a big move higher. What makes this strength even more impressive is that the stock is strong while the broad market is selling off today.', 'As is clear from the above write-up, there are at least a few developments in this market that are concerning. From interest rates to technical breakdowns, and we haven’t even mentioned the geopolitical tensions and approaching US presidential election, which only add to the uncertainty.', 'We also have to wait and see earnings from Nvidia today after the close, which is probably the most important earnings event of the season.', 'Nonetheless, even with all these bearish catalysts building there is always a bull market somewhere, you just have to dig.', 'Best of luck trading!', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.Let me start with Slide 4 for our 2023 highlights. I'm extremely proud of what the Gentherm team achieved in 2023 despite a continuously challenging operating environment. Demand for our thermal comfort, massage and lumbar solutions continues to accelerate. We secured new automotive business awards of $900 million in the fourth quarter, which brings us to $2.6 billion in 2023, setting a new quarterly and annual record.Our strong award momentum continued to drive revenue growth. We achieved record revenue for automotive, medical and total company for the full year 2023. In addition, we also achieved record annual revenue for climate controlled seats, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters in 2023. It's it's worth noting that adjusting for the impact from foreign exchange, the UAW strike and one-time recoveries, our core thermal product lines include CCS, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters, outperformed the production in our relevant markets by nearly 400 basis points in 2023.On the cost front, we continued our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. We've reduced adjusted operating expense as a percent of revenue from 20% in 2018 when we launched our first Fit-for-Growth initiative to 16% in 2023. We delivered the highest annual adjusted EBITDA in company history, an increase of more than 30% compared to 2022. And we generated nearly $120 million of cash flow from operations and repurchased over $90 million worth of Gentherm shares. The new business wins, record revenues in key product lines, improved profitability and solid cash flow generation demonstrates strong execution by the Gentherm team.Now turning to Slide 5. Let me highlight a few key pillars that drove our record $2.6 billion in new automotive awards in 2023. First, at the top left of the slide, our core thermal products continue to expand globally, particularly in high content product categories such as CCS and hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heaters. We won awards in 2023 which spanned across all ranges of vehicles from the likes of BMW, Cadillac, Mazda and Li Auto and BYD in China.Second, in pneumatic lumbar and massage, we are growing our market share and winning awards at a rate that is well above our original expectations. We have won conquest pneumatic lumbar and massage awards with BMW, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Li Auto, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, Volkswagen and one of the largest global EV manufacturers. These wins confirm the strength of our combined product offering, leveraging the Alfmeier acquisition. It's important to point out that a growing number of OEM customers want the combined thermal and pneumatic lumbar product, especially from an independent supplier who integrates with many seating providers. This is one of the unique value propositions that Gentherm offers.Let me remind you of a few key combined awards that we have won since the beginning of 2023. We won the highly desirable and contested award with BMW for CCS, seat heat and pneumatic lumbar and massage for their next-generation electric and ICE X Series SUVs, which include the X5, 6 and 7 and the iX5, 6 and 7. We won a combined CCS, seat heat, lumbar and massage full system award with Jaguar Land Rover for their new Jaguar BEVs. We've significantly grown our content with one of the largest global EV manufacturers, winning steering wheel heat, seat heat, CCS and pneumatic lumbar awards across multiple car lines. Finally, we won 3 CCS awards with Li Auto on their plug-in hybrid L9 and 2 future electric SUVs. In addition, we won 2 combined CCS and pneumatic massage awards from Li Auto on a future electric and plug-in hybrid SUV.Moving to the bottom left on Slide 5, our proprietary innovations such as ClimateSense and WellSense, which I will elaborate more on the next slide, have helped us to increase content per vehicle. For example, our ongoing ClimateSense development project with Honda has demonstrated significant savings in HVAC energy consumption by combining seat heat, steering wheel heat and interior heat. As a result, Honda awarded Gentherm multiple EV programs that include both heated interior solutions and our electronic control units. As we shared on the last earnings call, we won our first multifunction electronic control unit award from General Motors.And today, I'm pleased to announce one of the most important strategic awards in Gentherm's history. In the fourth quarter, we won a breakthrough, scalable ClimateSense software award for nearly all future architecture General Motors ICE and electric vehicles. Through this award, Gentherm's proprietary ClimateSense software features will be enabled across all General Motors vehicles equipped with seat heat, climate controlled seats and steering wheel heating. This will allow Gentherm's intelligent software solutions to bring increased comfort control and energy efficiency.Let me summarize my discussion regarding our award momentum by reminding you of a key differentiator for our company. Gentherm is an independent partner that can cooperate with any combination of the 50-plus vehicle OEMs and 30-plus seat manufacturers globally, including those that are vertically integrated, to create truly differentiated solutions. Our unique value proposition resonates with customers as demonstrated by our win rate of approximately 80% of our quoted pursuits for thermal and pneumatic solutions in 2023.Turning to Slide 6. Let me share a little more on how we're leading the industry in key innovations, starting with ClimateSense, the world's first scalable software-driven automotive microclimate solution. It uniquely delivers personalized thermal comfort for each occupant in the car by coordinating localized convective, conductive and radiant heating and cooling to provide optimal comfort while also reducing vehicle energy consumption and extending range. ClimateSense software seamlessly integrates with vehicle and HVAC controls to optimize the temperature for passengers individually.In addition to ClimateSense, our advanced engineering team continues to integrate our thermal products with lumbar and massage products to create innovative, full system solutions. The combination of heating and cooling the body with massage, including our industry's first proprietary pulsating massage, Pulse A, is opening vast opportunities for solutions that promote health and wellness experiences, also alertness enhancements and physical recovery in the car.As a result, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, we unveiled WellSense, a software-defined consumer experience that delivers customized in-cabin comfort sensations that promote alertness, wellness and wellbeing. It was great to see some of you at our booth, experiencing WellSense firsthand. The technology leverages science-based physiology research as the foundation for proprietary software that orchestrates heating, cooling, lumbar and massage comfort effectors. The WellSense software development kit, which includes over-the-air feature upgrades, can be integrated into any software-defined vehicle architecture.Trends are shifting towards consumers using their vehicles as a third living space outside the home or office, offering an additional revenue opportunity for OEMs to address consumer health and wellness needs. The launch of our proprietary WellSense is the next evolution of our software-enabled technologies, which positions Gentherm at the nexus of health, wellness, comfort and energy efficiency.Lastly, I'd like to officially introduce our next-generation integrated thermal lumbar and massage hardware system, ComfortScale. ComfortScale is a modular solution, which combines several distinct thermal and pneumatic comfort components into one integrated system. We believe ComfortScale will drive significant performance improvement for our customers as well as labor cost and logistics reduction for the OEMs and seat manufacturers. ComfortScale can be integrated with any foam and with any seat. It's adaptable for all OEMs and all Tier 1 seat manufacturers. It's scalable from an entry-level lumbar and seat heat system all the way to a high-end Pulse A massage and CCS system.I'm proud of the Gentherm technology team for bringing to market innovative, differentiated proprietary solutions such as ClimateSense, WellSense and ComfortScale. These innovations are expected to significantly increase Gentherm's content per vehicle and position us to be a strong contributor to software-defined vehicles of the future.Now turning to our Q4 automotive highlights on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, we launched our automotive solutions on 21 different vehicles across 13 OEMs, including BMW, Ford, Geely, Toyota and Volkswagen. We continue to see expanded application of our CCS solutions. In the fourth quarter, our CCS solutions were launched on the Ford Ranger, Mazda CX-90, Toyota Tacoma and the BEV truck with one of the largest global EV manufacturers.I'm pleased to share that Gentherm's ClimateSense was named a finalist for the prestigious 2023 Automotive News PACE Awards, with winners to be announced in April of 2024. In the fourth quarter, Gentherm was also named a winner of the Business Intelligence Group 2024 Big Innovation Award for our ClimateSense technology. And ClimateSense was also recognized as a winner of the 2023 Reuters DRIVE Honour in the reducing emissions category. These awards are clear recognitions of the impact ClimateSense can deliver through personalized comfort and reduced vehicle energy consumption. I'd like to congratulate the Gentherm team for receiving these coveted recognitions.Now onto Slide 8, where as I mentioned, we secured a quarterly record of $900 million of awards in automotive in the fourth quarter. We received 8 steering wheel heater awards across 7 OEMs. Importantly, we won hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heater awards with BMW, Geely, General Motors, Li Auto and Nissan. We won several CCS awards in the quarter. Of note, we won the new Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai QV, the Kia EV5, Nissan X-Trail, a midsized crossover for one of the largest global EV manufacturers, a new Great Wall plug-in hybrid SUV and the new Rivian electric delivery van.I'm also pleased to share that we are growing our business with our largest customer, General Motors, winning a highly contested CCS and multifunction electronic control unit awards for their next-generation truck platform, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we also won our first ClimateSense software award for nearly all future architecture General Motors ICE and electric vehicles that will enable ClimateSense to control thermal seating and steering wheels. This is truly a breakthrough win for Gentherm that showcases the value our proprietary software provides for our customers.With software-defined vehicles expected to grow in the global market in the coming years, Gentherm is perfectly positioned to increase hardware and software content to enable greater energy efficiency, personalization and novel comfort and wellness experiences. These wins confirm our strong market-leading position in thermal and pneumatic comfort. I'd like to recognize the global Gentherm team for securing a company record of $2.6 billion of new automotive business awards in 2023.Now before I discuss the medical highlights, I'd like to provide a brief update on our Battery Performance Solutions. If you recall, Gentherm invented an innovative and proprietary thin foil, flexible circuit product line that can be used as either a battery cell heater or a cell connecting device. However, in the past year, we have not secured any new cell connecting awards based on the mechanical structuring process. There are 2 fundamental reasons for this. First, OEMs and battery makers are becoming more conservative in both technology selection and pace of production for EVs. Customers are choosing to remain with the current chemical-etched and wire-based connection solutions despite the environmental and technical benefits of our technology.Second, where we have had the opportunity to win, the margin and return profiles would have been well below our company business case requirements. Consequently, we have decided to pause our pursuit of cell-connecting opportunities for the foreseeable future. Although we will continue to pursue select battery heating and cooling opportunities, we expect our BPS revenue to gradually decrease over the next few years. We've reassigned the majority of our BPS resources to work on our unprecedented new business awards in thermal, pneumatic and electronics.Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our medical business. The medical team delivered record revenue in 2023 with a strong finish in the fourth quarter, growing 15% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 26 new hospital customers in China, including Tung Shin, a top tier hospital. In the U.S., we successfully launched a group buy program with one of our key customers, HealthTrust Performance Group. We were awarded Blanketrol system upgrades throughout their member hospitals in the fourth quarter. And in Europe, we have converted competitors' convective warming accounts to resistive technology with our ASTOPAD as a result of increased demand for more sustainable solutions.As we shared on previous earnings calls, we've adapted our go-to-market model in the medical business to leverage large partnerships, distribution channels and white label opportunities. Consequently, we have reduced the size of our in-house sales team to improve our cost structure in medical. And we are laser focused on growing both the top and bottom line in this business.With that, I'll turn the call over to Matteo for a little more color on the financial results and to discuss 2024 guidance."", 'Matteo Anversa', ""Okay. Thank you, Phil. Let me start on Slide 10 and focus on the most significant items in our fourth quarter results.For the quarter, product revenues increased by 7% compared to the same period of last year. If we adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, our overall product revenue increased by 5%. Starting with the automotive segment. Automotive revenues were $354 million, reflecting a 7% increase compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for positive foreign currency translation and excluding the negative impact of the UAW strike, phasing out of the non-automotive electronics business, as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both periods, automotive revenues increased 10% against a difficult prior-year comparison.Actual light vehicle production in our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea increased 13% year-over-year. It is worth noting that our regional revenue mix is different from the actual production market. Adjusting for our regional revenue mix, primarily as a result of our smaller percentage of revenue from China, our revenue growth would have outperformed production growth by approximately 150 basis points.We saw growth in the majority of our product lines, and more specifically, our steering wheel heaters revenue increased by 22% compared to the prior year period due to higher demand of our hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heaters with VW and Buick. Automotive cables revenue increased by 15% due to higher volume with Bosch and Samsung. EPS revenue increased 11% due to higher volume with Mercedes primarily delayed timing from the third quarter as well as higher price recoveries.CCS revenues increased by 6% due to higher volume with Hyundai, Kia, BMW and the start of production at one of the largest global EV manufacturers. Seat heater revenue increased by 5% due to the ramp-up on our electric vehicle for a global EV manufacturer in Europe and the ramp-up of the MLA platform with GLR. Lumbar and massage revenue increased by 3% due to the start of production on vehicles with BMW and VW in Europe as well as higher volumes with Ford. Valve systems revenue increased by 1% due to the higher sales in Europe. Electronics revenue decreased 9% due to the phaseout of non-automotive electronics. And other automotive revenue decreased by 8%, primarily due to the material inflation recoveries received in the prior year period.Turning to the medical business. Medical revenues increased 15%, primarily as a result of the higher Blanketrol sales in the U.S.Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million, up from $41 million in the prior year period. The adjusted EBITDA rate for the fourth quarter was 13.4%, the highest profitability rate in 8 quarters. This compares to 11.9% in the year-ago period. The 150 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by lower freight cost, fixed cost leverage on higher sales volume, productivity at the manufacturing facilities and supplier cost reductions. These were partially offset by wage inflation and lower price recoveries relative to the prior year period. It is worth noting that sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin rate rose 40 basis points, driven by higher manufacturing productivity and supplier cost reductions.Operating expenses were $64.6 million in the quarter compared to $66.2 million in the prior year period. If we adjust for acquisition, integration and restructuring costs as well as non-cash stock compensation expenses in both periods, operating expenses were $59.5 million, up from $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase of approximately $7 million was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, partially offset by higher R&D reimbursement.Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.90 per share compared to $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate for the year, adjusted by the impact of the medical goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter, was approximately 23%. This amount is lower than the guided range of 28% to 32% due to the one-time benefit as a result of a tax entity restructuring in Europe that was implemented in the fourth quarter of the year.Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 11. Our cash position at the end of the quarter was approximately $150 million, and our net debt stood at $73 million. Net debt increased sequentially by $20 million due to the $61 million share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Our net leverage ratio was 0.4x at the end of the fourth quarter, well below our target of 1.5x. Based on the trailing 12-month consolidated adjusted EBITDA ended December 31, we had $278 million of remaining availability on our line of credit, and the total available liquidity as of year end 2023 was $428 million.Now before I discuss the 2024 guidance, I would like to thank the global Gentherm team for the disciplined financial management in 2023 that allowed us to deliver a 200 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin rate year-over-year on a pro forma basis, despite significant inflationary headwind. In addition, I'm proud of the team for the strong free cash flow generation, which enabled us to return approximately $90 million to our shareholders through share repurchases.Now let me turn to Slide 12 for our 2024 guidance. We are expecting revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, assuming a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.1 and light vehicle production in our relevant markets decreasing at a low single-digit rate in 2024 versus 2023. Adjusting for approximately 50 basis points of FX benefit year-over-year, the midpoint of our guidance implies an organic revenue growth rate of 5%. It is worth noting that if we exclude BPS, automotive cables and valve systems, our climate and comfort revenues are expected to grow more than 8%, excluding foreign exchange.Our guidance assumes higher revenue in the second half compared to the first half as a result of the timing of new program launches. Adjusted EBITDA margin rate is expected to improve to 12.5% to 13.5%. Our guidance assumes a 50 basis point headwind associated with the startup costs at our new plant in Morocco and Mexico and product engineering and launch costs associated with our record new awards.Due to the revenue cadence I mentioned earlier and the impact of contractual price downs, which will be offset in the second half of the year by supplier cost improvements and productivity actions, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter to be below our full year guidance range and for the rate to steadily improve throughout the year. As a result of above mentioned items and one-time costs associated with our new plants, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter of 2024 to be slightly lower than the first quarter of 2023.Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26% to 29% and capital expenditures to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million. 2024 CapEx will be higher than prior years due to increased investments for the ramp-up of new capacity, including the 2 new clients to support our record new awards.Due to our decision to pause the pursuit of BPS cell connecting board opportunities that Phil mentioned earlier, combined with the decline in vehicle production forecast in our largest region of North America, as well as the uncertainty on the timing of ramp-up of electric vehicles, we are revising our 2026 outlook that we provided in our strategy discussion in February of last year. We now expect 2026 revenue to be between $1.9 billion to $2 billion. And as a result of the reduction in the revenue outlook, adjusted EBITDA margin rate is now expected to be approximately 16% in 2026.We continue to execute on our Fit-for-Growth initiatives, and specifically, we are targeting $80 million net savings by 2026 across workstreams, including SG&A, sourcing excellence, value engineering, manufacturing footprint, automation and product profitability. In 2023, the team delivered over $10 million of savings, and we are currently implementing additional projects that will yield another $45 million of savings by 2026. These actions are expected to deliver nearly 70% of our $80 million goal. And in addition, we have a pipeline of projects that positions us to achieve the remaining 30%. As we continue to identify and implement additional Fit-for-Growth actions, we gain momentum on our path to a high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate over time.And with that, I'll turn the call back to Phil for some closing remarks."", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Thanks, Matteo. Now let me summarize on Slide 13. I want to thank the global Gentherm team for continued strong execution in 2023, delivering record new business wins, record revenues and record adjusted EBITDA. In 2024, our climate and comfort business is expected to grow more than 8% with expanding margins.In order to accomplish this and our long-term growth, we're laser focused on 3 priorities in 2024. First, we're confident in our ability to continue the strong momentum of winning new automotive business awards and maintaining our industry-leading market share, given our large pipeline of opportunities. We will also execute on our unprecedented award backlog to ensure a successful ramp-up with our key customers. Second, as Matteo just mentioned, we will execute on Fit-for-Growth initiatives to expand margins in the near term and position the company to achieve high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate over time. And third, we will aggressively bring to market and expand our industry-leading and proprietary next-generation solutions such as ClimateSense, WellSense, Pulse A massage and ComfortScale.Now let me wrap up with Gentherm's unique investment thesis on Slide 14. First, we're a pure play leader in thermal and pneumatic comfort. It's also important to highlight the benefit of being independent. We can work with any OEM and any seat manufacturer to create scores of innovative and unique configuration and solve for all of their applications. Second, the global automotive market is large, and more importantly, the thermal and pneumatic comfort market is growing at a much faster pace than the automotive market. We expect to see a much higher rate of adoption of our products into vehicles, and we're extremely well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Third, we provide unique, innovative and energy-efficient solutions that are key to the vehicles of the future. Our technology is best-in-class and often a generation ahead of our competition. Finally, our track record of execution against our strategy along with our robust financial discipline will enable us to deliver high-return growth outpacing the market.Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to start the Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM.', 'Matthew Butler Koranda', 'I want to start off with the awards. So just wanted to start out with the award environment and the $900 million in awards that you reported for the fourth quarter. Looks like a pretty big uptick sequentially and year-over-year. Just wanted to get a sense for how much of that was combined thermal and pneumatic technology in the awards. And then also on the GM award, just wanted to clarify what exactly you mean by the term architecture. Not to dumb it down too much, but do you just mean GM vehicles that incorporate multiple Gentherm products like steering wheel heat and CCS, et cetera? Just a bit more on that software solution and sort of what it does for your growth for the next few years would be helpful.', 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Thanks, Matt. I'll start with the first question on the awards mix. It's probably better to put it in terms of the full year than just a specific quarter. But as we pointed out, our pneumatic business is growing at a faster rate than we expected. Consumer pull, especially from our traditional Gentherm long-standing customers to replace other competitors and to grow in those customers has been tremendous. And definitely, as I pointed out with some of the examples, we're seeing this gradual shift to combined solutions for multiple reasons. The efficiency of supply and supply chain plus improved performance being the primary drivers. But if you look at the total awards for the year, we would have had a record on the thermal products alone, and then of course, add on top of that the growing pneumatics and combined awards, really a tremendous year. And the pipeline is still strong going forward.So shifting to -- let me shift to the ClimateSense question with General Motors. Essentially, what this means is that our ClimateSense software will be embedded in nearly all vehicles of the GM future architecture in the future. And that's really the way they're designing their vehicle around allowing these kinds of features to be more prevalent. So we're really excited about it. It really unlocks the ability to orchestrate any thermal seating or steering wheel application and really fits into our scalable view of how we're implementing ClimateSense so that really ClimateSense is going to be the fundamental control of these microclimate devices. And that will help us to scale the content from, I would say, today's kind of normal CCS all the way up to that full content of ClimateSense over time with that customer. Hope that helps."", 'Matthew Butler Koranda', 'Yes. Very helpful. And then maybe just one for Matteo. The fourth quarter, it looks like you made some adjustments or you provided sort of a hypothetical adjustment for what automotive revenues would have been without UAW strike and then the non-automotive electronics phaseout. Maybe just wanted you to provide a little bit more color on how you got between sort of the plus 5% to the 10% adjusted revenue growth in automotive. And then for the outlook, it does look like you guys are including some decent outperformance versus production, which would be a return to sort of the normal state for Gentherm. Can you just talk about how that phases through the year? Just curious about -- I think you had mentioned more launches towards the latter half of the year. So any sense you could give us for relative growth rate versus production in the first half versus the second would be great.', 'Matteo Anversa', ""Sure. So maybe let me start with the first one. Actually, in the press release, we outlined a little bit with a table. You really have a couple of things happening. The impact of the strike in the quarter was about almost $9.5 million, which was clearly lower than what we had anticipated in the last earnings call. And then when we are re-adding back the non-automotive electronics revenue, which was about $2.7 million, and then we had about $3.5 million of one-time customer recoveries, meaning that we're not expecting those to repeat and then the foreign currency impact. So when you break it down, that's how you get to the reported number of growth to be about 10% that we outlined in the press release and the comments.On the cadence, I think was your second question, we're expecting revenue for sure, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to be lower in the first quarter, and then we'll continue to grow progressively throughout the year. So it's difficult to project and pinpoint what the outgrow will be in every quarter. But overall, the reason why the second half revenue will be higher than the first half is primarily driven by timing of new launches, which are coming out in the later part of the year."", 'Matthew Butler Koranda', ""Okay. That makes sense. And then just last one for me and I'll turn it over. But the 2026 guidance change that you guys made looks like a change of about $250 million at the midpoint relative to your earlier guidance that you provided. I think the Battery Performance Solutions growth was supposed to be about $150 million of that. So just wanted to understand sort of where are we taking out incremental revenue. It sounded like you guys mentioned just a little more reticence on the part of OEMs on EV production. Any other items to call out in terms of the change there for 2026?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Sure, sure. Yes. I mean, clearly, the BPS, you called out the right number at the midpoint was $150 million growth of BPS. We're actually going to see a decline of BPS. So not just a loss of the growth, but actually a decline from now until that time period. So that's going to be the biggest driver of the reduction. And then we'll be, as you pointed out -- and we expect to see a delayed ramp-up of some of the EVs that we are targeted on just based on feedback from our customers and what we're seeing in the market expectations. The second -- the next factor is related to North America vehicle production in 2026. We're actually seeing a decline in a few of our large North America OEMs outlook for 2026 based on the S&P Global outlook, which kind of makes sense to us. So that's going to be a factor as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Chin with Seaport Research Partners.', 'Glenn Edward Chin', ""Congrats on all the wins and the win rate. Very encouraging. Just sort of following on Matt's line of questioning. There's been a lot of delays, deferrals in EV launches, production, et cetera. I assume that's already reflected in or there's nothing further to be reflected in the awards that you just booked the $900 million in this quarter. But is it possible to dimension, Phil, what sort of revisions might have to be made to prior bookings? Notwithstanding the fact that you're talking about it for 2026, but any way you could dimension for us, for example, what percent was EV related perhaps?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Well, we don't -- it's tough for us to break down the percent EV in the awards because some of the awards -- in fact, many of the awards are cross platform. Just to give you an example, the BMW X Series win that I called out is on both the ICE and the EV. So that's more of a combined number. But I would say we -- to the best of our ability, we've built that into our plan for 2024 and then 2026 as well. I mean, we clearly still believe in EVs as a driver for future growth. As that becomes more clear in those out years beyond 2026, obviously we'll start to build that into our outlook."", 'Glenn Edward Chin', 'Okay. Very good. And then just a follow-up on the GM architecture question. Can you give us a sense of the timing there? When do these launch?', 'Phillip M. Eyler', 'It will take a couple years before that new architecture goes in.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.', 'Ryan Ronald Sigdahl', ""Just staying on GM and ClimateSense. Is that award -- or the architecture for ClimateSense, is that included in the Q4 awards? And then also, is that include -- any of that included in the 2026 targets, given it'll take a couple years?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Yes, it's included in both."", 'Ryan Ronald Sigdahl', 'Got it. And then on content, you historically have talked about 2x to 4x higher content for ClimateSense. Is that a good rule of thumb for this award?', 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""I think it scales, given the fact that this software will orchestrate any level of climate seating and steering wheel. It could span all the way from, let's call it, an entry vehicle that has low content all the way up to the higher content. So we'll have to see how that plays out across their portfolio over time. But we definitely are seeing a movement towards higher content as we have ClimateSense control in a car."", 'Ryan Ronald Sigdahl', 'Got it. And then just on the BPS cell connecting product. You guys launched a very large award with BMW just a few quarters ago there. I guess is the assumption that that sunsets after this platform?', 'Phillip M. Eyler', 'Yes, it is.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan.', 'Ryan Joseph Brinkman', ""Just another one on the recent win with GM. I understand your share of GM seat comfort business will rise. But is there something about this award that also makes you think that maybe the penetration of seat comfort products within GM could materially increase, either because the vehicles -- it's offered in more vehicles, more trim levels or maybe because it's designed right into the electrical architecture? Or maybe because the synergies and the economies of scale that both you and GM might realize by commonizing and expanding the offering could afford a lower price point to GM or hopefully the consumer helping to drive the penetration? Just trying to understand if this is more about increasing your share versus competitors of these products or maybe about driving the penetration of the products? Which would you say is the bigger opportunity?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Yes. I think it's probably some of all of those points. I think those are very astute points. But I think the biggest thing to kind of break it down, on EVs, we definitely expect to see a higher penetration rate and content on EVs. And certainly, that could apply to any kind of electrified vehicle, by the way, whether it's a full EV or a plug-in hybrid. And mainly because, obviously you get the comfort benefit, but you also get the range extension. And that remains a clear important feature for our customers. And then if you look at the ICEs, I mean we're really excited that ClimateSense is going to orchestrate climate seating in ICEs. And the reason is a very compelling value proposition for consumer comfort because it really becomes seamless. In essence, what you're doing is you're focusing on the passenger or driver relative comfort level at that microclimate location and not necessarily the entire cabin. And so this is really starting to pay off for us. So I think that's also going to help drive content and penetration on ICEs as well."", 'Ryan Joseph Brinkman', ""Okay. I wanted to ask a couple of questions, too, around the pause of the BPS cell connecting, starting with I remember you highlighting some of the strengths of your product like it was lighter weight and more environmentally friendly than some of the competitor solutions, and there's thought to be this growing need for cell connecting and battery health monitoring. So maybe you could just help us understand what maybe changed there in the market. I wonder if maybe the solution was incorporated into more comprehensive battery management systems technologies that other suppliers were offering? Or what would you say changed there?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Well, no, I don't think it has anything to do with the battery management system architecture. That I think is basically the same. To be frank with you, the fundamental shift that we're seeing is related to our competition, especially chemical etch competition. That space is loaded with capacity. And I believe personally that the level of accepted pricing because of that excess capacity is putting us in a very difficult position when it comes to pricing competition. And there's no doubt, our consumers have -- or our customers have confirmed to us that our product provides extremely beneficial sustainability benefits and technical benefits, which revolves around the material selection, and as you pointed out, the light weight. But frankly, the drive towards lower cost batteries is winning today, and that chem etches is kind of taking it there. So we're in a position that if that pipeline is not going to be in front of us in the near term, it makes more sense for us to defer our resources and investments and focus into the areas that are seeing accelerated growth, which is our climate and comfort products, thermal and pneumatic."", 'Ryan Joseph Brinkman', ""Okay. That's helpful. Then the second question there also on the BPS is that product, the cell connecting was once thought to maybe pick up the slack left by an earlier product, which was the thermoelectric temperature regulation. Not of the big batteries, of course. You've got air cooling. But of these smaller batteries that might be applicable for 48-volt or micro-hybrid type vehicles, and that was with some European OEMs or maybe some luxury OEMs, and some of that was rolling off. And that was understood to be I think because 48-volt didn't really pan out like the industry once thought. But it just seems like in the very recent past here, just kind of in the fourth quarter, there's been some more scuttlebutt about it, including with the cyber truck having officially launched and Elon Musk saying on X that he was mailing to Jim Farley and Mary Barra a packet with all the technical details explaining why they need to double down as well, which will decrease the cost for everybody. And Jim Farley responded positively on Twitter to that saying that maybe they need to push again. And just curious if there's any potential for that market to come back to life? Or is there some other competitive dynamic going on there, too, where maybe the thermoelectric regulation isn't as attractive as was once thought? Or is it just the market's smaller? What are your thoughts for 48-volt is going and what you might potentially be able to provide there?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Yes, I'm not optimistic on the thermoelectric BPS product for 48-volt. And the primary reason is the architecture for 48-volt systems is a little different when you look at what you mentioned on EVs, especially. This is -- the 48-volt that in the past has been used has been really used as a drivetrain boost. And to do that, it required a lot of utilization of those batteries, creating a lot of heat. And that's where our cooling product really became pretty important. We do see some opportunities on 48-volt with air cooling. We are winning some business, and we called that out in the last couple of quarters with different customers. Hyundai Kia as an example, we're going to be cooling all of their 48-volt batteries using our air cooling devices. So there's some of that built into our outlook. Certainly, the 48-volt BASIS POINTS, thermoelectric BPS with Mercedes will gradually decline over time. It's not going to be a digital decline, but it will steadily decline. So if you net all that out -- and we do have some built-in wins with our MSP-based battery heating as well using the same technology as the CCB. But netting all that out, we're seeing a net decline in revenue of BPS through 2026."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Luke Junk with Baird.', 'Luke L. Junk', ""Apologies for the background noise here. Phil, I was hoping we could start with the ClimateSense award with GM. And what I'm really hoping to tease out is just the software opportunity alone versus scaling in hardware over time. I really just want to better understand the materiality both of the software piece that you announced today and then the underlying compute to controller, understanding that you can add hardware to that overtime."", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""Yes. Yes, I mean I wouldn't call it a material revenue driver for us. It is very high margin. But it's more about what it enables than the specific driver of revenue growth for the software. It does open up more opportunity for us on ECUs. And we've called out I think 1 or 2 quarters ago the win on a multifunction ECU for General Motors. So that -- we think this helps us to drive content on our electronics as well. But we've specifically made our software really a software product that can be used on any hardware. Our goal is to find ways to get ClimateSense embedded to show the value that ClimateSense generates, thus driving much higher content and penetration. And we believe ClimateSense has the power to do that. So that's kind of what's behind it. I would look at this as really firming up our long-standing strategy of driving software-enabled hardware through our portfolio."", 'Luke L. Junk', ""Okay. That's really helpful. And then I appreciate you might not be able to give us too much here because it's pretty recent, but just curious, any feedback following CES on WellSense specifically? Just in terms of customer engagement, maybe any kind of preliminary engineering engagements or just other indicators and interest in that platform?"", 'Phillip M. Eyler', ""I would say tremendous interest by our customers. It matches exactly what many of our customers have as their vision for differentiating their offerings. And I really want to highlight the impact this product could have on the software-defined vehicle architectures. We believe this provides a feature that consumers will continually pay for after the purchase of the vehicle. And I think if you look at a lot of the announced software-defined vehicle features that folks have talked about to help them drive revenue, you won't find any that are more compelling than the one we're offering. So I think it really is gaining a lot of traction. Obviously, it'll take us some time to gather some awards and build that in, but I'm really encouraged by the response."", 'Luke L. Junk', ""And then my last question probably for Matteo. Just hoping you could bridge the midpoint of the EBITDA range of 13% versus where 2023 shook out. I'm really hoping to unpack just the big buckets in terms of what you expect incrementally from Fit-for-Growth. You mentioned some supplier cost reductions in the back half of the year. And then just underlying leverage and productivity, how should we bucket those at a high level."", 'Matteo Anversa', ""Sure, look. So volume is driving about 160 basis points of margin expansion. The Fit-for-Growth actions, primarily supplier cost reductions, value engineering, so taking costs that were out of our bill of material is driving about 130 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity at the factory growth is about 90 bps. So these are the positives. And then on the negative side, we have -- we're not expecting to have the same amount of price recoveries from the customers in 2024 as we did in 2023. Actually, the environment on that front is getting more and more challenging. So we are expecting a drag of about 160 basis points on price. And then wage inflation, we continue to see elevated labor inflation, particularly in Mexico and Eastern Europe. So it's about almost 100 basis points. And then the investment in the new plants that I mentioned earlier and the R&D to fulfill the awards that we won, it's another 50 basis points drag. So that's, at a high level, the walk for the year. Sure."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session and this concludes our call today. We thank you for your interest and participation. You may now disconnect your lines.']"

This SWOT analysis delves into the intricacies of the filing to provide investors with a clear understanding of PNC's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. PNC, a diversified financial services company, has shown resilience and strategic growth, particularly following its acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. The financial tables within the filing reveal a robust balance sheet and a commitment to expanding its retail banking business, asset management, and corporate banking services. PNC's financial health is underscored by its strategic acquisitions and a focus on digital transformation, positioning it well for future growth."", ""Robust Acquisition Strategy and Market Expansion: PNC's acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. has significantly bolstered its market presence, adding over 600 branches and approximately 2.6 million customers. This strategic move has expanded PNC's footprint across seven states, enhancing its competitive edge and customer base. The $11.5 billion cash transaction reflects PNC's strong financial position and its ability to execute large-scale acquisitions, which contribute to its growth and diversification."", ""Diverse Revenue Streams and Financial Stability: PNC's updated noninterest income categorization, which includes asset management and brokerage, capital markets and advisory, and residential and commercial mortgage, among others, demonstrates a diversified business model. This diversity in revenue streams provides financial stability and reduces dependency on any single market segment. The reclassification aligns with industry standards, improving transparency and comparability with peers, which is a testament to PNC's strong financial governance."", ""Dependence on Economic and Market Conditions: Despite PNC's diversified portfolio, its performance is still subject to fluctuations in economic confidence and market conditions. As detailed in the filing, a downturn in the economy or a loss of consumer trust could adversely affect the demand for PNC's products and services, leading to a decline in interest income and noninterest revenue. This inherent vulnerability underscores the need for PNC to continuously innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics."", ""Operational Risks and Regulatory Challenges: PNC's operations involve complex systems and controls, which are susceptible to risks such as system failures, security breaches, and cyberattacks. Additionally, the company faces stringent regulatory requirements that restrict activities, impose capital adequacy, and liquidity conditions. Noncompliance with these regulations could result in substantial sanctions, affecting PNC's reputation and financial performance."", ""Digital Transformation and Technological Advancements: PNC's commitment to leveraging technology to create efficiencies is a significant opportunity. By investing in digital platforms and enhancing its online and mobile banking services, PNC can attract tech-savvy customers and improve the customer experience. This focus on digital innovation positions PNC to capitalize on the growing trend of digital banking and fintech collaborations."", ""Climate Action Strategy and Sustainable Finance: PNC's formalized Climate Action Strategy, initiated in 2022, presents an opportunity to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. By integrating climate-related risk considerations into its risk management framework and supporting clients' sustainability goals, PNC can tap into the burgeoning market for green finance and demonstrate environmental leadership."", 'Competitive Landscape and Customer Retention: PNC operates in a highly competitive financial services industry where customer acquisition and retention are critical. The company must continuously innovate and offer competitive rates to maintain its customer base. Any failure to do so could result in the loss of market share and reduced profitability.', ""Reputational Risk and Public Perception: PNC's reputation is vital for its success and growth. Negative publicity or a failure to meet environmental, social, or governance targets could harm its brand image and customer loyalty. As the financial industry faces increased scrutiny, PNC must ensure that its practices align with public expectations to mitigate reputational risks."", ""In conclusion, PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) exhibits a strong foundation with its strategic acquisitions, diversified revenue streams, and focus on digital innovation. However, it must navigate economic sensitivities, operational risks, and a competitive landscape. Opportunities in digital banking and sustainable finance present avenues for growth, while threats from reputational damage and customer retention require vigilant management. PNC's forward-looking strategies, including its Climate Action Strategy, position it to leverage its strengths and address potential weaknesses and threats, ensuring long-term value creation for stakeholders."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Since then, Cisco has dramatically underperformed as internet routers turned from a glamorous field to a commodity. We could wonder whether several of today’s high-flying tech stocks will later turn into commodities and see their valuations tumble in the years to come.', 'Regardless, Cisco has now become a far more trustworthy investment. Not surprisingly, the company’s revenues have continued to grow as the internet needs more and more infrastructure. The pandemic drove further adoption of technologies such as remote working and studying which drove additional demand for Cisco products.', 'The company has wisely pivoted toward software and recurring revenue businesses such as cybersecurity. This should make Cisco more valuable as its revenue mix shifts toward higher margin and more predictable sources.

However, all stocks aren't created equal. Some are unlikely to deliver anything resembling solid returns over the long run, while others look so promising that investing in them almost seems like a no-brainer."", ""Let's consider two companies in the latter category: Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). Find out below why these healthcare giants are sure bets for the long haul."", ""Merck is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. It markets Keytruda, a cancer medicine that became the top-selling drug in the industry last year. Keytruda has been maintaining solid momentum for years, gaining an impressive number of approvals while growing its sales at a good clip. It has been Merck's key growth driver for a while, something that should continue until it encounters a patent cliff toward the end of the decade."", ""In the meantime, Merck's financial results continue to be strong, although it didn't seem that way last year because of the negative impact of the significant drop in sales of its coronavirus medicine, Lagevrio. Merck's revenue increased by just 1% year over year to $60.1 billion. Excluding Lagevrio, the company's top line grew by a much better 9%. Keytruda's sales of $25 billion were 19% higher than the year-ago period."", ""Merck's vaccine business is also doing pretty well, led by HPV vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9. Their combined sales for the year rose by 29% to $8.9 billion."", 'Merck has an important catalyst on the horizon. The drugmaker is awaiting approval for sotatercept, an investigational treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which could come down as early as next month.\xa0Unlike other medications, sotatercept targets the underlying causes of PAH. It looks likely to become one of the heirs to Keytruda once the latter starts facing generic competition.', ""Sotatercept won't replace Keytruda by itself, but it will be an integral part of Merck's post-Keytruda strategy. The company's pipeline should produce other important approvals in the next few years, including that of MK-0616, a highly promising therapy for hypercholesterolemia currently in phase 3 studies."", ""In all, Merck's pipeline features 30 phase 3 programs and 80 phase 2 studies. Finding a full roster to replace Keytruda completely won't be easy, but the company's track record strongly suggests that it can."", ""Merck is also an excellent dividend stock. It has increased its payouts by 40% in the past five years and currently offers a yield of 2.41%. Whether you're seeking growth or dividends, Merck's impeccable track record and solid underlying business make it an obvious choice for long-term investors."", 'Intuitive Surgical specializes in developing and marketing robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) devices like its best-known product, the da Vinci system. It is the undisputed leader in a very underpenetrated market that carries significant barriers to entry.', ""Let's start with the difficulty of making it in the RAS market. First, competitors have to spend years and a small fortune to develop a viable robotic system -- and that's just step one. The next step would be to test it and then hopefully earn regulatory clearance for it. This entire process can take a decade."", 'Medical device specialist Medtronic has been trying to challenge Intuitive Surgical with its own RAS system, Hugo. Though it is now in use in some countries, it has yet to earn approval where it matters most: the U.S. By contrast, Intuitive has already gone through all these steps, granting it a significant advantage.', ""Furthermore, there is a massive runway ahead. As Medtronic's management noted on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, only about 5% of procedures that could be performed robotically currently are. And Intuitive Surgical continues to march forward."", ""Last year, Intuitive Surgical's revenue grew by 14.5% year over year to $7.1 billion. Worldwide da Vinci procedures jumped by 21% in the fourth quarter. Intuitive also ended the year with 8,606 of its da Vinci systems installed, an increase of 14% year over year."", ""The rise of weight-loss medicines such as Ozempic is having an impact on the company's financial results as it decreases demand for weight-loss surgeries. However, that shouldn't be a problem over the long run as bariatric procedures make up just 4% to 5% of global surgeries. Given how underpenetrated the RAS market is, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the vast opportunities available to the company."", 'As a result, Intuitive Surgical remains a no-brainer for growth-oriented investors focused on the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Merck right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Merck, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Merck wasn’t one of them.

However, the company must navigate challenges such as high levels of debt and sensitivity to economic conditions. Opportunities for growth lie in market expansion, technological advancements, and digitalization, which can enhance the guest experience and operational efficiency. Nevertheless, threats from a competitive landscape and geopolitical factors require vigilant risk management. Royal Caribbean's strategic focus on sustainability, customer engagement, and technology positions it well to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

If you want to skip our introduction covering how without the semiconductor industry, and how it's essential to the development of artificial intelligence, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom. "", ""Earlier this year, OpenAI's co founder and chief executive officer Sam Altman demonstrated his ability to remain in the news after he estimated that the total funding required to build an independent supply chain of semiconductors to fund all possible use cases for artificial intelligence could require $7 trillion in capital. Altman's talk with investors in the UAE reported by the Wall Street Journal involved his vision of a massive boost to global chip making foundries, energy, data centers, and other infrastructure required to sustain the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to fund artificial intelligence applications all over the world."", ""While $7 trillion is more money than the annual economic output, or the GDP, of several countries, similar figures have been common in the semiconductor industry these past couple of months. In fact, it was semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang who stated during the firm's earnings call for the second quarter of its previous fiscal year:"", 'The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We’re seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it’s the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you’re seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.', ""Huang and Altman's comments show that at least when some of the most influential persons in the high computing and semiconductor design industries are concerned, the global semiconductor industry can grow by the trillions of dollars."", ""In fact, on the day that Huang made the comments, NVIDIA's shares were trading in the $450 - $460 range, and had you believed him when he'd said that artificial intelligence and the broader advances in data center computing carry the potential to take his firm to new financial heights and bought NVIDIA's stock, then your investment would have delivered a price appreciation of roughly 45%."", ""Quite impressive, but given that NVIDIA's stock is up by 230% over the past year, it does make one wonder where the rest of this growth comes from. Well, after its earnings press release for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 hit the wires, NVIDIA's shares gained 27% over the next couple of days. This was the first true surge in the semiconductor stock that is at the top of the food chain when we talk about artificial intelligence. Why did the shares jump more this time? Well, the press release saw Huang throw around the trillion dollar estimate for the first time."", ""However, Huang and Altman are not the only semiconductor executives who have commented on artificial intelligence. In fact, since it's now become a major global phenomenon, managements of other semiconductor stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) have all weighed in. AMD's Su, whose firm is the only direct competitor to NVIDIA's products in non-Arm based GPU designs, believes that the artificial intelligence data center computing products market was worth $45 billion in 2023. Her remarks, made in December also shared the Santa Clara, California based chip designer's estimates that by 2027 end, this market will have grown to $400 billion."", 'Similarly, semiconductor stock TSMC\'s management confirmed that it had ""witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications"" in 2023. Likewise, Intel chief Patrick Gelsinger shared during the earnings call in January 2024 that not only had his firm witnessed ""the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030, but that Intel is the only company ""able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""The final bit of Gelsinger's comments is particularly important when we talk about semiconductor stocks that could benefit from AI-related tailwinds. This is because while chip stocks such as NASDAQ:NVDA, NASDAQ:INTC, NASDAQ:AMD, and NYSE:TSM are direct beneficiaries of the growth in AI, others like Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) can also benefit from booming AI demand as their products are indispensable when it comes to designing chips."", ""Today, we'll talk about some such semiconductor stocks that hedge funds are buying in the era of artificial intelligence."", 'Close-up of a robotic endoluminal surgery device performing a procedure in an operating room.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we ranked semiconductor stocks that are directly or indirectly exposed to artificial intelligence by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Rich Puccio. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.On to disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Revenues to gross margin, operating and nonoperating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow in our comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items.When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2024 was a 14-week quarter.And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Thank you very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. But before I begin, I'd like to welcome ADI's new CFO, Richard Puccio, to the call, which is only a few weeks in, but we're very excited to have him on board. He brings tremendous financial experience and capability from complex technology sectors, which I think will be very valuable as we continue to extend our leadership in the intelligent edge era. I'd also like to recognize Jim Mollica for serving as interim CFO and thank Jim for his continued partnership and contributions to our success.Now on to the results for the first quarter. ADI delivered revenue of more than $2.5 billion, operating margins of 42% and earnings per share of $1.73, all above the midpoint of our outlook. As we previously discussed, the inventory rationalization at our customers that began during the middle of 2023 is expected to continue through our second quarter. Encouragingly, first quarter bookings improved sequentially, growing our confidence that inventory-related headwinds will largely subside this quarter. That said, the macro situation remains challenging, and the shape and timing of a second half recovery will be governed by underlying demand.Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, operational agility and prudent capital management are serving us well during this downturn. We've invested heavily in R&D, customer engagement activity and manufacturing resiliency fueling our future growth even as we maintain the industry-leading profitability that supports our practice of robust capital returns. To that end, I'm pleased to highlight that we announced a 7% dividend increase yesterday, making 2024 the 20th consecutive year of higher dividends for shareholders.Now digging a little deeper into our investment philosophy, we continue to focus on anticipating our customers' future needs in what's becoming a software-defined, AI-driven world, leveraging pervasive sensing, edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity. The technological complexity facing our customers is compounded by their need to deliver solutions that are both secure and extremely power efficient. So let me share a little more now about how we are strategically allocating our capital to deliver more solutions value to our customers and further support their confidence in long-term supply assurance.Since our acquisition of Maxim, we've increased our engineering population by around 10%, complementing our world-class Analog talent with increasing levels of digital, software, AI and systems expertise. This breadth of engineering gives ADI the capabilities to tackle more of our customers' challenges and grow our SAM across markets. In addition, as our engineers increasingly work shoulder to shoulder with our customers to co-architect their solutions, we further deepen our understanding of their technological and market complexities. This strengthens our ability to deliver increasingly stronger innovation from components to physical edge systems.And I'd like to share now a few examples of what I mean. For example, in the industrial sector, digital transformation is driving investment in edge-based connectivity and control platforms that enable secure, power-efficient monitoring and control of automation systems. Last month, Honeywell announced that we'll use ADI's deterministic ethernet and software configurable I/O solutions across their factory automation and building management offerings. Our portfolio enables customers to securely deliver end-to-end signal integrity between the edge and the cloud in a power-efficient and highly flexible platform configuration. This system approach enables us to capture 3x more value, and we expect additional design wins due to high customer interest globally.In the automotive sector, we've aligned our business to the secular trends of electrification, advanced safety systems and immersive digital in-cabin experience. For example, our Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link, or GMSL solution, continues to gain broader adoption as customers seek to extend high-performance data and video capabilities across their fleets. We recently increased our share at a top 3 global auto manufacturer, extending our position across all their brands and quintupling our GMSL opportunity at that customer.In data centers, AI and machine learning computing systems require orders of magnitude more processing, and thus energy compared to traditional workloads. Our portfolio of high-performance power and protection solutions, specifically designed for vertical power delivery is helping customers rearchitect their data center systems to improve power delivery and system performance. Last quarter, we secured a significant design win from a large hyperscale customer for our multiphase vertical power solution that reduces power losses by 35% when compared to conventional ones.In Healthcare, this market continues to digitalize to enable more predictive and preventative treatment regimens. ADI has been on the forefront of this transition, and I'm pleased to let you know that we've recently received FDA clearance for a noninvasive remote monitoring platform, that enables home-based management of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. This solution leverages our deep domain expertise, leading-edge capabilities across signal processing and sensor modalities, and unique algorithms that enable medical providers to act early, precisely and effectively. As a platform, this also allows us in the future to use our data-driven AI algorithms to make this even more personalized. This advance unlocks a new growth vector for ADI, adding more than $5 billion of new SAM.Switching now to the evolution of our supply chain, I'd like to share some of our progress in manufacturing resilience, which is a growing priority for our customers. Over the last 2 years, we've invested record levels of CapEx to expand our capacity and to enhance resiliency. Now with line of sight to achieving our goal of doubling front and back-end internal capacity in 2025 will begin to significantly reduce our capital spend.Notably, approximately 10% of our investments have been focused on implementing more efficient systems that will deliver sustainability benefits, including greatly reducing input resources and emissions, which, over time, will also lower our operating costs. These investments enable a more flexible hybrid manufacturing model and will increase our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. This unique ability helps to capture the upside in strong demand backdrops and better protect our gross margins during more challenging times.Complementing these organic investments, we also extended our foundry partnership with TSMC to secure additional 300-millimeter fine-pitch technology capacity at their Japan subsidiary. Our investments, combined with the support of our foundry partners will enable us to manufacture our products in multiple geographic locations, enhancing our resiliency and giving our customers greater optionality and assurance over their supply chains. So in closing, as always, we're keeping one eye on the present and one eye on the future. I have confidence in the steps that we're taking to preserve our capital and navigate the near-term challenges while ensuring that we make the necessary investments to increase our competitiveness and accelerate our business in the future.And so with that, I'd like to pass the microphone over to Rich."", 'Richard C. Puccio', ""Thank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to have joined ADI and look forward to helping the company navigate the near term while ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Despite continued challenging business conditions, we achieved first quarter revenue, which was slightly above the midpoint of our outlook or down 8% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Industrial represented 48% of revenue in the quarter, down 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year.As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Automotive, which represented 29% of revenue, was up 2% sequentially and 9% versus the year ago period, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth. Notably our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions collectively increased double digits year-over-year.Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, declined 10% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireline fared relatively well driven by AI-related demand, while wireless decreased as global investments in 5G remain depressed. And lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue, down 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year driven by continued sluggish end demand across applications. Now on to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 69%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable mix lower revenue and lower utilization.OpEx in the quarter was $679 million, down 2% sequentially despite the extra week, driven by lower variable comp, disciplined discretionary spend and structural cost improvement. As a result, operating margin of 42% finished near the high end of our outlook. Nonoperating expenses finished at $75 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. All told, EPS was $1.73, slightly above the guided midpoint.Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and equivalents increased more than $340 million sequentially and ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, our net leverage ratio remained below 1. Inventory decreased nearly $90 million sequentially, driven primarily by finished goods, while days increased to 201 due to lower revenue. Channel inventory dollars declined again in 1Q with weeks of inventory finishing slightly above our target range of 7 to 8 weeks.Moving on to cash flow items. Over the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 CapEx to be approximately $700 million. As a reminder, these are gross CapEx figures, not including any of the anticipated benefits from both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Over the last 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 28% of revenue. During the same time period, we have returned more than $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases.And since our Maxim acquisition, we have returned nearly $12 billion or more than 130% of free cash flow to shareholders, reducing share count by 8% while also increasing our dividend per share by 33%, including our most recently announced 7% increase. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term. We aim to use 40% to 60% to grow our dividend annually with the remaining free cash flow used for share count reduction.Now moving on to guidance. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than selling. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to decline sequentially with the largest decline in industrial as we continue to meaningfully reduce channel inventory. Operating margin is expected to be 37%, plus or minus 100 basis points. This includes the impact of unfavorable mix and lower utilization as we further reduce balance sheet inventory. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.26 plus or minus $0.10.In closing, the actions we've taken to protect profitability in the near term as well as the natural shock absorbers embedded in ADI have enabled us to maintain strong profitability even as our quarterly revenue has fallen significantly from its peak. Importantly, with the strength of our financial profile and the growing importance of our technology, we will continue to invest confidently in our future, regardless of where we are in the cycle.I will now give it back to Mike for Q&A."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', 'Thanks, Rich, and welcome to the call.(Operator Instructions)With that, we have our first question, please.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""To the extent, you guys are guiding down now mid-30% year-on-year. If I go back to historic drawdowns, you haven't seen revenue fall that far other than 2001, 2009, where we had kind of significant demand disruption. So it kind of looks like the worst inventory correction maybe we've ever seen. Can you just talk to that? Does that reflect how much inventory excess there might have been? Or just any kind of sense check as we approach the bottom as to why the downturn looks kind of severe?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Thanks, Joe. I think first and foremost, the -- if you like, the events that caused the supply chain fracture was unique. And every single segment was impacted every single customer, every single business. So this is truly the broadest base demand inflection I've ever seen in my 30-something years with ADI. And I've been through all those different perturbations. So I think that's the uniqueness of the event itself, I think is what caused the level of impact. And we see everything compounded. We saw the supply chain fracture. Then we saw the shortage, and then we got the behavior that we typically see in a shortage situation. You get double ordering, you get holding. And we're seeing that everywhere.The area that we've probably seen, I would say, the biggest correction is in the industrial market. And I think our sense is that it began in the second -- kind of the second half of the past year, and that will take 4 to 5 quarters to correct, I believe, from the beginning of the decline to when we start to see growth again. So I think that's pretty much it. But now we're in a situation where the lead times are very uniform. And actually, we got ahead of the supply chain issues, I think, faster than most. We've got our lead times back into better shape than most quite quickly. And so we saw the downturn, I think, more quickly than others.So all that said, Joe, I think the underlying demand for our products and technologies in the years ahead. We remain very, very bullish about that. And I expect, as we've indicated that we'll see a return back to growth in the second half of our fiscal year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.', 'Stacy Aaron Rasgon', 'Rich, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the segment guidance next quarter. I know you said everything down in industrial worse. But I mean like industrial has got to be down probably more than 20% sequentially, and that would probably still assume everything else is down double digit sequentially. Is that what you have in mind? And any further color you could give us would be great.', 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""I'll grab that one. It's Mike. So you're right to think industrial is the weakest. I would say, 20% sequentially, sure, you can put that number in your model if you want to, 20% plus or minus sequentially. I would say comms is also probably worse in the midpoint of your guidance, so down more than the 16% we guided to. While auto and consumer probably do a bit better, but are both down pretty significantly sequentially as well. And really, the big driver on the industrial piece, as we laid out is the channel reduction in the -- for the inventory in the channel, which is impacting industrial more so in other markets. I hope that helps Stacy."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.', 'Christopher Brett Danely', ""Just to follow up on that question. How much of this downturn do you think is just pure inventory correction versus demand? And then any comments you could have on just demand trends as far as what you're hearing from the distribution channel and your customers?"", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""I'll start and then I think Vince will add some clarity also on it, but this really is a supply-driven demand correction, what you're seeing here. And Vince outlined that in the answer to the first question where the supply chain fracture lead times extended for an extended period of time. Those have normalized. We're still seeing what are happening as our customers is, they build a lot of inventory over that time. Why our lead times are extremely long. Now our lead time is back to normal, so they're seeing them reduce their balance sheet inventory to match our short lead times, so the cycle times match up. So really also a majority supply chain some demand. There's some areas of pockets of weakness in demand. But really overall, I'll call it more of a supply than demand correction in our business. And we talked about in the script and as well the press release, that supplied normalizing here in our second quarter."", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. I think, Chris, if we look at the 2 halves of FY '24, I believe the first half is all about inventory indigestion and digestion. And as Mike said, we largely get through that part of the headwind by the end of our second quarter. And then in the second half, all the indications our bookings are getting stronger, cancellations are abating. Our conversations with customers suggest that we'll begin to return to a growth pattern in the second half. The big question is the macroeconomic dial where that's positioned. And I think at the margins, if I look at where we are this quarter versus last quarter, at least from a macro standpoint, maybe with the exception of China, we're more bullish than we were."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.', 'Vivek Arya', ""Vince, on the last earnings call, you mentioned bookings were stabilizing. I think this quarter, you're saying bookings are improving. And I'm curious which end markets are showing the best recovery in bookings? And then importantly, how should this inform us about what ADI will see as we get into the July quarter, should we be assuming some kind of seasonal recovery, should we assume things flatten out first? And if I could attach kind of part B of that, which is what happens to gross margins as you start to see that flattening out and potential recovery? So just the shape of what recovery looks like in sales and margins if bookings flattened and now they seem to be improving?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. Well, I think, look, as soon as demand in flex, and we get back into a more normalized growth pattern, Vivek, everything will improve. Our utilizations will improve. We have undershipped the channel, we've undershipped our customers. So we've been working very, very hard in the company to make sure that when demand and flex that we will get a -- we've got the supply in place. We've got lots of finished goods and diced up inventory. So we're in a great position to address the recovery.On the first part of your question about where are we seeing the bookings improvement, pretty much everywhere, pretty much everywhere, across all the segments. And if you look at industrial, I'd say the 2 healthiest parts of industrial right now is, as we message to the external world, aerospace and defense and healthcare, they've got fundamentally quite different drivers to, say, the factory automation or instrumentation business. But those 2 sectors are holding up better than the rest. But even in a more traditional industrial sector like instrumentation, all of these new high-performance computing systems need you test equipment, so that benefits ADI.So I think, in general, it's true to say, maybe with the exception of our wireless business, most sectors are seeing a return to a more normalized bookings pattern."", 'Richard C. Puccio', ""And Vivek, I'll give you a little more color on the gross margin outlook. So it's in the last call, we talked about gross margin will be 68% to 69%. We came in at the high end, a good result given the large drop in industrial that we've been talking about and with an inventory takedown of almost $90 million quarter-over-quarter. The 2Q outlook implies 67% plus or minus, a bit lower than what we thought would be given the weaker revenue, especially in industrial and the fact that we're taking down factory starts further in 2Q to reduce inventory by another $50 million to $100 million.And if I think a little bit further out to the half 2 outlook, tough to predict right now is the revenue and the shape of the revenue recovery will be the governor on gross margin trajectory. But our best sense is gross margin trends higher in the second half, as we don't see utilization going much lower as inventory continues to decline meaningfully at these start levels and we'll continue to leverage our swing capacity."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""And Vivek, as you asked a 3-part question, I'll chime in as well for third quarter outlook. I know you gave me the outlook question. So it's hard to say, right? Our lead times are 13 weeks are lower. So we don't really have visibility into the third quarter today. But if you look back over history over the past decade, our B2B markets are about flattish sequentially in 3Q from 2Q, sometimes they're up a little bit, sometimes they're down a little bit depending where you are in the cycle, while consumers start seeing some holiday builds kind of up mid- to high single digit sequentially. So that's kind of historical context. We're not guiding in the third quarter, but that's how we should frame it.And then to add on to what Vince said about bookings. Bookings actually increased last quarter, and the quarter before that. So 4Q and 1Q bookings both improved. And what's interesting now is you look at our bookings, they're approaching parity, which is a good sign that we just see a pickup in the back half of the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.', 'Harlan L. Sur', ""So if I look at fiscal '23, China was about 18% of your total revenues. It was the worst performing geography down about 13% for the full year. Because Lunar New Year was so late this year, it feels like this did add a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of this year, but obviously, now we're post-Lunar New Year. What are the demand signs out of this region? Are orders also growing sequentially in the China regions? Are cancellations also showing signs of stabilization patterns as well? Maybe even signs of a potential pickup in the China region? Just want to get your views."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""So if you take a step back from a geo perspective, whole regions are weak, North America, Europe, China. China has been weakest the longest, I would say. The rest of Asia is doing better than the big 3, but still weak as well. And like I said, China is the weakest source of demand. around Chinese New Year, honestly, if there's something unique about it, we called out. But I think what Vince said in the last question basically was bookings are improving globally as well as in China before and after Chinese New year. So really no impact from Chinese New Year and kind of the commentary we've made."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""Vince, I'm curious how you would characterize sell-through today versus sell-in. I think at a conference a couple of months ago, you had mentioned that sell-in was tracking 15% to 20% below sell-through. Is that still the right ballpark number? And is that what you're seeing in the current quarter? And I guess, if so, if the end demand environment doesn't deteriorate over the next 6, 9 months? Could there be a quarter later in the year where your revenue run rate is tracking above $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion?"", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""I'll grab the first part of that on the sell-in and sell-through part of it, Toshi. So selling and sell-through really relates to the channel. We reduced our channel inventory dollars the past 2 quarters, I would call it around a $50 million reduction, plus or minus per quarter over the last 2 quarters. Looking at embedded in our guidance is a much bigger reduction of channel inventory. If you want to put a number around $100 million or so in our outlook, that's probably what we're seeing on the channel side. So we're reducing a lot in the channel. Now as you look at the back half of the year, from a channel perspective, we think the sell-in and sell-through should be better matched given the actions we've taken over the last 3 quarters. And I'll pass it to Vince to talk a little about the customer inventory situation on the end customer side."", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. On the customer side of things, we've been monitoring very, very carefully across the various segments. Our customer shipment rates, their inventories and their ADI goods on hand. And we're clearly under shipping our customers current demands. So we feel that we've got a situation now in terms of our -- we're in a good inventory position on hand. Our customers are beginning, as Mike indicated, to replenish their order books, ADI's goods. And that gives us the confidence as the book-to-bill approaches unity that we're seeing the worst of the inventory correction.And in the second half, we will get back to a more normalized growth pattern. So as Mike said, there's a very good balance between the direct channel, the distribution channel in terms of the inventory situation, but we're ready for the upsurge."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities.', 'William Stein', ""I want to welcome, Rich, but direct a couple of questions to Vince, please. Vince, the more vertical capabilities that you talked about, it sort of suggests that you're needing to either partner more closely with a smaller number of customers or maybe you wind up pushing somewhat into their capabilities and are potentially competing with some of them. And I wonder how you contemplate managing that dynamic?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Will, thanks very much. You're -- unfortunately, the line shopped. I think I got your question about verticalization, competing with our customers potentially. Hopefully, you can hear me, okay, that it's not a 2-way line problem here. Will, look, the -- we've been on a journey over many, many years now to continue to build out our core component franchise, but also add more value to our solutions. Our business has become more solutions-oriented particularly over the last decade in every single segment that we play. And that kind of domain application-driven engineering that ADI has been distinguishing it so at the edge over the last decade, that will continue, and we're continuing to build that.I talked on the -- in the prepared remarks about this point of care, acute health care solution that we've just brought to market where we've got an FDA approval. I think what's happening, Will, in the world is that there are certain places like that where we have a white space to attack. We're building a complete solution that has both hardware and software makes a lot of sense. But the truth is, even in the traditional markets and with the larger customers that we deal with, more and more footprint capture, if you like, has been taking place. Why? Because we tame our customers' complexity. And I've talked before about the asymmetry and capabilities in the Analog space between the capabilities ADI has got and our customers have got. They expect us actually to add more solution value and build more complete solutions and clearly define where the line is between where their core value is versus where ADI's core value is.So I think we're not competing with our customers, but we have very vibrant discussions about where we draw the line of the labor divide, so to speak."", 'William Stein', ""That helps. If I can ask a follow-up. You talked a bit about AI. It's sort of a familiar topic to us lately. Maybe too much so. There's a narrative here where there are some creative capabilities, in fact, I would say, engineering-focused capabilities that maybe made more efficient or productive with Generative AI. In a world where the story about Analog design engineer capability being so limited and not driving a significant advantage for ADI. I wonder if that story changes at all because of this capability. Have you started using this for circuit design? Or do you anticipate that it could be used by others, either competitors or customers?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes, it's a good question. Well, look, everybody is trying to figure out the meaning of the AI in their businesses. We're using AI today in our tool chains. We're using machine learning and AI in our products, around our products. We're starting to use it in our business. And I think -- I believe that anything that can be -- anything that is routine -- and that can be automated, that's the way of technology. Technology automation will take over the things that are more routine. We play very much at the high end of the performance spectrum.So unless there's generative intelligence that can outperform our imaginations, which I don't see any time in the foreseeable future. We're truly in a realm where the intellectual property value and the learning system that we've got in this company will matter more and more. But, I think we view AI as a tremendous opportunity. As clearly in the product development process from how the products are designed, what we put as ingredients in our products, and we're also, by the way, putting AI into the customer support tool chain. So it is a part. We're embracing it, and we believe that it will be an accelerator and the copilot, if you like, with our engineering population."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', 'Will, it sounds like from your cell phone line, we can do need some more 5G coverage.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Can you talk to any period costs versus underutilization charges that you're taking? And any of those -- how much of a headwind are those now? And how much will those help you as they might reverse themselves coming out of the downturn?"", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""So I think your question is on how much of the impact on our gross margins underutilization versus mix. I think if you look here, our peak gross margins were about 74%. Our outlook, as Rich pointed out, embeds about 67%. That decline is really mix and underutilization, about equal parts, I'll call it. As you look to the back half of this year, it depends what mix is going to do. I think industrial is bottoming here, so that should help a little bit. From a utilization standpoint, Rich also pointed out, our starts are low enough to reduce inventory meaningfully. We've been doing that. We'll do it again in 2Q. So I don't see it starts going down, they're probably start going up, which should provide a tailwind to gross margins. How fast the gross margins pick up really depends on those 2 factors, how fast the revenue picks up and how much of it relates to the industrial sector."", 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Okay, Mike. But I guess, are there any inventory charges? That's the question."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""So from inventories, yes, I would say, a good question. You're right. We have a lot of inventory. As you can see on our balance sheet. The -- there's no acceleration of inventory charges in our gross margins. The inventory charge from a reserve standpoint have been elevated for the past few quarters, and they probably stay that way as you go into the back half of this year into next year. But that's not a headwind anymore. It's already kind of built in the run rate.We will go to our last question, please."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Christopher James Muse', ""You talked about auto being down sequentially, but seeing, I guess, the best performance out of all the different segments. Curious if you can kind of walk through what you're seeing from Tier 1 auto correction and whether you think that will be completed exiting April as well?"", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""Yes. Sure. From the auto standpoint, C.J., I would say, yes, there is definitely an inventory correction going on in auto like all our markets as Vince pointed that out, the supply fracture at everyone is, to a lesser degree, than auto than other markets, but it's not really because of the inventory. It's because of the growth drivers in that business, whether it's BMS, GMSL A2B functional safe power, the growth in those areas are offsetting the overall call it inventory digestion in automotive area. You're right to say that on the Tier 1 side or the OEM side, there's some froth inventory. But we're seeing that being digested. Will it be all complete.By the second quarter, we'll see, but I do feel good about those growth areas continue to grow this year. And for the full year, will auto grow, I don't know. We'll see. But it really depends on how strong the growth is in the growth areas and how much of the overhang on the inventory side is. But net-net, we do feel good about auto being our best performing end market here in 2Q and for the full year '24.All right Thank you C.J., and thanks everyone, for joining our call this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on the website. Thanks for joining us, and have a great rest of the day."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

Meanwhile, asking rents for one-bedroom units rebounded after declining since July 2023, increasing by 0.1% year over year to $1,591 in January.

My earnings growth estimate is also roughly in line with the common consensus."", ""My future growth estimate leads me to my analysis of the stock valuation. I consider Nvidia's price the most significant risk when investing in it at this time. The stock has a price-earnings ratio of around 96, which comes down to around 36 based on future earnings estimates. Its forward price-earnings ratio is in the bottom 30% of companies in the semiconductors industry."", 'Nvidia is evidently overvalued by traditional discounted cash flow analysis, but this method is unlikely to fully account for the premium that is usually attributed to high-tech stocks. Looking for leading advanced technology companies trading below fair value is often impossible.

However, investors may want to consider how the market will react when earnings growth comes down to more reasonable levels. It could continue to price the company at a premium, or more likely, the valuation will drop to a more reasonable level, creating some short-term volatility before the stock price begins to grow more conservatively.', ""It is also important to understand Nvidia's forward price-earnings ratio of around 36 at this time is considerably lower than its median price-earnings ratio of 43.50 over the last 10 years. That could present a reasonable buying opportunity right now as long as investors are willing to tolerate some future volatility. The medium-term potential instability in the price of the stock seems worth it, considering the large long-term expected market growth of AI and Nvidia's crucial function in this area. If the market presents a moderate price drop in the stock soon, that is when I will be looking to take my first proper stake in the company."", 'Nvidia is very closely related to Taiwan Semiconductor and, as such, remains significantly exposed to geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. surrounding Taiwan at this time. While an invasion of the country seems unlikely to me based on my ongoing analysis of international relations, investors must be cautious not to allocate too heavily to technology at this time. If a larger war breaks out, I believe technology stocks will be the most significantly negatively impacted, although the broader economic effects will reach all industries.', 'Overall, Nvidia still looks appealing to me. I would be cautious of allocating to the stock at this time too heavily, but even if bought at the present valuation, I believe long-term growth can still be expected over the next decade even if the stock experiences some volatility. My rating for the stock is a hold.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Kress', ""Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year.Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached a tipping point of new computing era. The trillion-dollar installed base of Data Center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skywalk, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern Data Centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI.In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-on-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.Fourth quarter Data Center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our Data Center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference.Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale. Enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private cloud or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy.In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-on-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first 2 months than the 2 previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases.The consumer Internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.In addition, consumer Internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. All the customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP, and Snowflake.The field of foundation of large language models is thriving, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.AI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world's many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion, pharmaceuticals and generative biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU-specialized cloud providers.Just this morning, we announced that we collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the-art new Gemma language model to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, data center, and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as Automotive, health care, and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low-latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full-stack accelerated computing platform.We estimate that Data Center revenue contribution of the Automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions include systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, curation, labeling, and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications.In effect, nearly every Automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive Data Center processing demand to grow significantly.In health care, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging, and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in health care over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara health care platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for the proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem.In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI.Shifting to our Data Center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our Data Center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single-digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in Q4, and we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter.In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems.From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubled the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers.Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year-on-year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest-performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the Ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the Data Center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over Ethernet that are purpose-built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro with their global sales channels are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter.We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners.Okay, moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year-on-year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor Cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI TOPS, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating and everyday productivity.The rich software stack we offer with our RTX DPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, 7 out of 8 pixels can be AI-generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the TensorRT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large language models, generative AI can run up to 5x faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEM. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14-inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 TOPS of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best performing AI PC platforms.At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially, and up 105% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, Automotive, and robotics.In Automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize workflows from design, to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers, including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like Lotus are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience.Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleet. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter. Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA.Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong Data Center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases.Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in Data Center and ProViz, partially offset by seasonal decline in Gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4; and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Health Care Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in person for the first time in 5 years. GTC will kick off with Jensen's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19.At this time, we are now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""Congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jensen on the Data Center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within Data Center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium- to long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that? And if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years?"", 'Jensen Huang', ""Thanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions. One more time? First question was..."", 'Colette M. Kress', 'OpenAI.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""I guess your expectations for Data Center, how they've evolved."", 'Jensen Huang', ""Okay, yes. Well, you know we guide 1 quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth, calendar '24 to calendar '25 and beyond, and let me tell you why. We're at the beginning of 2 industry-wide transitions, and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you could tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from 4 to 6 years. There's just no reason to update with more GPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to.And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20:1, huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. In generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it.And the third is, it is enabling a whole new industry. And this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at, and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time, a Data Center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of the company. We now have a new type of Data Center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory, and you've heard me describe it as AI factories.But basically, it takes raw material, which is data. It transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA built, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible start-ups in digital biology generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on.And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of Data Center. And this Data Center, we call it AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We're seeing diversity. One of the other reasons -- so the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, you know that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that are being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA's doing inferencing.The inference part of our business has grown tremendously, we estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You could see from their CapEx and their discussions. But there's a whole new category called GPU-specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU-specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI.ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe, there's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI, so they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multibillion-dollar businesses: auto, health, financial services, in total, our vertical industries are multibillion-dollar businesses now.And of course, sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different, and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them. Each one of the regions around the world, the data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data, they want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation into AI and provision those services themselves.So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West will surely be replicated around the world. And these AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. It's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe the year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume it's, in some cases, the same GPUs are used for training and inference. How solid is that measurement?"", 'Jensen Huang', ""I'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated and -- but we estimated it, and let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, a year ago, the recommender systems that people are -- when you run the Internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because, as you know, the Internet has trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there, and your phone is 3 inches squared. And so the ability for them to fit all of that information down to something such a small real estate is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems.These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU accelerating for reranking. And it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. And as you know, a recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet.Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe, these are all generative models. The list goes on. And none of these, as I just mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.', 'Stacy Aaron Rasgon', ""I wanted to -- Colette, I wanted to touch on your comments that you expected the next generation of products, I assume that the Blackwell to be supply constrained. Can you dig into that a little bit? What is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained? Like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25? Like when do those start to ease?"", 'Jensen Huang', ""Yes. The first thing is overall, our supply is improving. Overall, our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us. Everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators to transceivers and networking and cables, and you name it, the list of components that we ship. As you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip, but the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated things we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason.If you ever look at the back of the Data Center, the systems, the cabling system is mind-boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world has ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year-over-year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides, and through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best.However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from 0 to a very large number, and you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a new generation of products and right now, we are ramping H200s, there's no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of Ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X, Ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system.But with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of Ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation so that we could optimize Ethernet for AI. And so InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure, Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking, and that is ramping. So we'll -- with all new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products, and we work as fast as we can to catch up with the demand. But overall, net-net, overall, our supply is increasing very nicely."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen.', 'Matthew D. Ramsay', 'Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask, I guess, a 2-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was getting at on your demand being significantly more than your supply even though supply is improving. And I guess the 2 sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there\'s any kind of buildup of product that might not yet be turned on?And then I guess, Jensen, for you. I\'d be really interested to hear you speak a bit about a thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller start-up companies to things in the health care arena to government. It\'s a very, very unique technology that you\'re enabling. And I\'d be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about ""fairly allocating"" sort of for the good of your company but also for the good of the industry.', 'Colette M. Kress', ""Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally.So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that allocation and both helped us with our communications with them."", 'Jensen Huang', ""First, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product road map and transitions. And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place and where and when. And so they know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities and, of course, allocation. We allocate fairly. We allocate fairly, do the best of our -- best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily.As you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when a Data Center is not ready? Nothing is more difficult than to have anything sit around. And so allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. And where we do -- the question that you asked about the end markets, you know that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs, and very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the health care companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies, there's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging. There are warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies.All of these start-ups -- large companies, health care, financial services, and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. And oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. And so this ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. But at the core of it, we want to allocate fairly with avoiding waste and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments, but if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to take as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower? Or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog?"", 'Colette M. Kress', ""Yes. So let me highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand, given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for.The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, component that we need for manufacturing but also often we are procuring capacity that we need. The length of that need for capacity or the length of the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next 2 quarters but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are predesigned to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need as several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward.So wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long lead times or things that need a capacity to be built for us."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research.', 'Benjamin Alexander Reitzes', ""Congratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that it should go back to the mid-70s, if you don't mind unpacking that. And also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products? And what do you think are the drivers of that comment?"", 'Colette M. Kress', ""Yes, thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks, really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those 2 quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefit from favorable component cost in the supply chain kind of across both our compute and networking, and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. So looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. So we're really looking at just a balance of our mix. Mix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year and those are really just the drivers."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Christopher James Muse', ""Bigger picture question for you, Jensen. When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out?"", 'Jensen Huang', ""C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One is that it's accelerated, and two, it's programmable. It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally at the very beginning when CNNs and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through RNNs to LSTMs to every RLs to deep RLs to transformers to every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers that every single -- and now time sequence stuff. And every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base.This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor Cores, like our Transformer Engine for Tensor Cores, improve new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor Cores, meanwhile supporting the installed base at the same time. And so as a result, we take all of our new software algorithm inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand.On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary, like Transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper Transformer Engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better. So our customers' installed base is enriched over time with our new software.On the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden, amazing breakthroughs in large language models were made possible. And those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand, we make giant breakthroughs on the other hand."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in the prepared comments, you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also pointed out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single-digit percent of your total Data Center business. So I guess the question is, what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market? And why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that opportunity again?"", 'Jensen Huang', ""At the core, remember, the U.S. government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. And the U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars, if you will, are the restrictions. And so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused, so that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. And that took some time. And so we reset our product offering to China, and now we're sampling to customers in China.And we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the specifications of the restriction. And so that's it. This last quarter, we -- our business significantly declined as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. But after that, hopefully, we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler.', 'Harsh V. Kumar', ""Jensen, Colette and NVIDIA team, first of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about -- a little bit about your software business, and it's pleasing to hear that it's over $1 billion. But I was hoping, Jensen or Colette, if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business. In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from."", 'Jensen Huang', ""Let me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams, and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. And whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them, and their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams, and we enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing.As you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing, SQL versus SQL structured data versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine learning to computer vision to speech to large language models, all -- recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries.If you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now people understand that software is really key.And the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing, and when it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow, to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing, all of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem.So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market with it is think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system. It's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge $4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously, for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started."", 'Operator', 'I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang, CEO, for closing remarks.', 'Jensen Huang', ""The computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand with increasing throughput while managing cost and energy. The incredible speed-up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world.We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this industrial revolution. Every company and every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI.Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world data center infrastructure installed base in the next 5 years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.This new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer Internet companies. And now every industry is on board, from automotive to health care to financial services to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform with industry-specific application frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem gives us the speed, scale, and reach to help every company, to help companies in every industry become an AI company.We have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose, so be sure to join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.""]"

We want to bring in David Gandler. He is the CEO of FuboTV. David, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for taking the time to join us here on Yahoo Finance this morning."", 'DAVID GANDLER: Thank you for having me.', ""SEANA SMITH: So let's talk about the suit that was filed yesterday after the bell. And you've alleged in the suit that even before this joint venture was announced, that you believe these companies have had a clear agenda that would be-- not advantageous to FuboTV. What is that agenda?"", ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, it's pretty simple. You're seeing the impact of Netflix on these businesses, their inability to compete. And so, I think the way they look at us, and have looked at us for years, is, basically, how do we marginalize this company to ensure that we don't find ourselves, you know, several years from when we launched in a situation where we now have a Netflix of sports or, you know, a more niche bundle that we have to deal with?"", ""And so they have utilized pernicious MFNs to distort pricing. They forced us to bundle content in the hundreds of millions of dollars of cost to us that customers didn't really want. And then they come up with this brilliant idea of, hey, we want to attract customers that are not interested in this sort of larger bundle."", 'So, when you put all of that together, and the aggressive fees that are well-- grossly above market, actually, you end up having a service that has basically taxed customers a ridiculous amount of money over time. And so, my view here is very simple, that there are significant monetary reparations in order here.', ""And we will gladly return those to customers, anything that we're able to gain in the form of promotions and discounts going forward. So, this is a real situation. It's anti-competitive. And all we ever wanted to do was to compete on equal terms, but that has been proven to be impossible."", 'SEANA SMITH: David, when it comes to pricing, you quickly mentioned that there-- I guess how significantly do you see bundling tactics like this eventually raising prices for the consumer?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Well, I mean, one of the worst things about this and, you know, again, I'm not a legal expert, but to me, this is almost borderline racketeering. Because what's happening in the industry is that, you know, the media companies are saying, look, if you want the full bundle, go get a paid TV subscription. And at the same time, they're taking certain pieces of content out of the bundle to force a consumer to get that one extra game or two extra games to pay for another service."", ""So they're basically double paying in more than, I would say, 30% to 50% of cases for the same content. So, there's no way that prices will not continue to escalate. And I think one of the ideas is, if we reduce the number of competitors in the space, we can basically run the table."", ""BRAD SMITH: If we did see this deal go through, and there was some type of moderation or outflow because now you had consumers who were gravitating perhaps towards another service, what would that mean for FuboTV specifically, as you think about the liquidity, as you're funding the current operating plan that you had laid out to investors back in November?"", ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you brought that up. I mean, you know, this is not something new, right? You're talking about media companies that own their own distribution. And as I said, they distort pricing to us. This is something that we've been dealing with for nine years."", ""And, you know, if you look back historically, obviously, I can't comment on the current quarter or 2023 full year, but what I will say is looking backward, is that we have done a tremendous job in being very efficient. We've met or exceeded guidance, I would say, 13 or 12 to 13 times out of the last 14 or 15 quarters. We have improved-- we beat consensus three times on the bottom line."", ""And, you know, we're continuing to march down our path to achieve profitability, regardless, in 2025. But we shouldn't have to do it in such a way where they block us in every possible opportunity to grow our business. Frankly, there are significant damages here because we have not been able to compete fairly with a group of companies that they put us in, which is with Hulu."", ""We've not been able to package in the same way. We don't have access to ESPN+. And so, you know, but we still believe that we're on track with respect to our 2025 plan, again, based off of the last quarter numbers that we provided in November."", ""SEANA SMITH: David, just pushing back just a bit, because I think you could, or people out there could, make the argument that, hey, this industry is more competitive than it had been a decade ago, two decades ago when you have the entrance of many of these larger tech giants. They are now on the playing field there. What's your response to that argument? The fact that it's not just anymore about some of these legacy players."", ""DAVID GANDLER: But it is, because if you think about what they've done, they've weaponized an American institution, which is the NFL. You cannot-- at least in my view, is they have these rights for the next eight to nine years going into 2030."", ""So, when you control 100% of the National Hockey League rights, national television rights, and 100%, at least as of today, the national NBA rights, 50% of NFL and college football, you're basically dealing with a group of companies that are controlling for now, at least, and for the foreseeable future, this industry, with a goal of colluding and ensuring that they maintain that type of control. What's interesting to me is, and I'm sure you would agree with this, is that no longer can they consider merging because that, obviously, would be a non-starter for any DOJ to consider."", ""So therefore, this is the next best option. Let's circumvent merging and just collude via this, I'll call it-- because they haven't named it yet, so I'll name it for you guys, which is sports cartel TV-- to really marginalize players like Fubo."", 'BRAD SMITH: This feels like a reversion back to some of the cable bundles that we had known in the past, but on streaming grounds. And I would love to know how consumers should perceive these partnerships that are moving forward?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, I mean, if you look back to my shareholder letter of 2021-- I believe it's actually exactly maybe three years ago-- I said we were going to move from bundling to unbundling, to the eventual rebundling, of this content. We have conducted numerous surveys. We collect 2 billion data points a month."", ""And basically, what we found is that consumers, three out of four consumers prefer to watch content on an aggregated app versus a direct-to-consumer app. And I think these media companies are learning the hard way-- tens of billions of dollars of losses that they're asking us to subsidize-- that it doesn't work and that the churn rates are too high, the marketing costs are too high, the tech costs are too high. And so the only way to do this is to really stomp out competition."", ""And I think consumers should be very nervous about this because I think, historically, we've seen this playbook. Whether it's with email or with any other services, they start out either free or cheap. And very quickly, if you look at the compounded annual growth rates in terms of pricing for any services, you'll see how quickly they ramp up once they start to feel comfortable in a market."", ""So this is very bad for customers. They should really be upset about this. They should be worried about it. And, you know, we've set up a landing page, savemysports.com, really asking people to read the letter that we put out there to support free choice and competition. Because ultimately, it will benefit them.""]"

We want to bring in David Gandler. He is the CEO of FuboTV. David, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for taking the time to join us here on Yahoo Finance this morning."", 'DAVID GANDLER: Thank you for having me.', ""SEANA SMITH: So let's talk about the suit that was filed yesterday after the bell. And you've alleged in the suit that even before this joint venture was announced, that you believe these companies have had a clear agenda that would be-- not advantageous to FuboTV. What is that agenda?"", ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, it's pretty simple. You're seeing the impact of Netflix on these businesses, their inability to compete. And so, I think the way they look at us, and have looked at us for years, is, basically, how do we marginalize this company to ensure that we don't find ourselves, you know, several years from when we launched in a situation where we now have a Netflix of sports or, you know, a more niche bundle that we have to deal with?"", ""And so they have utilized pernicious MFNs to distort pricing. They forced us to bundle content in the hundreds of millions of dollars of cost to us that customers didn't really want. And then they come up with this brilliant idea of, hey, we want to attract customers that are not interested in this sort of larger bundle."", 'So, when you put all of that together, and the aggressive fees that are well-- grossly above market, actually, you end up having a service that has basically taxed customers a ridiculous amount of money over time. And so, my view here is very simple, that there are significant monetary reparations in order here.', ""And we will gladly return those to customers, anything that we're able to gain in the form of promotions and discounts going forward. So, this is a real situation. It's anti-competitive. And all we ever wanted to do was to compete on equal terms, but that has been proven to be impossible."", 'SEANA SMITH: David, when it comes to pricing, you quickly mentioned that there-- I guess how significantly do you see bundling tactics like this eventually raising prices for the consumer?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Well, I mean, one of the worst things about this and, you know, again, I'm not a legal expert, but to me, this is almost borderline racketeering. Because what's happening in the industry is that, you know, the media companies are saying, look, if you want the full bundle, go get a paid TV subscription. And at the same time, they're taking certain pieces of content out of the bundle to force a consumer to get that one extra game or two extra games to pay for another service."", ""So they're basically double paying in more than, I would say, 30% to 50% of cases for the same content. So, there's no way that prices will not continue to escalate. And I think one of the ideas is, if we reduce the number of competitors in the space, we can basically run the table."", ""BRAD SMITH: If we did see this deal go through, and there was some type of moderation or outflow because now you had consumers who were gravitating perhaps towards another service, what would that mean for FuboTV specifically, as you think about the liquidity, as you're funding the current operating plan that you had laid out to investors back in November?"", ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you brought that up. I mean, you know, this is not something new, right? You're talking about media companies that own their own distribution. And as I said, they distort pricing to us. This is something that we've been dealing with for nine years."", ""And, you know, if you look back historically, obviously, I can't comment on the current quarter or 2023 full year, but what I will say is looking backward, is that we have done a tremendous job in being very efficient. We've met or exceeded guidance, I would say, 13 or 12 to 13 times out of the last 14 or 15 quarters. We have improved-- we beat consensus three times on the bottom line."", ""And, you know, we're continuing to march down our path to achieve profitability, regardless, in 2025. But we shouldn't have to do it in such a way where they block us in every possible opportunity to grow our business. Frankly, there are significant damages here because we have not been able to compete fairly with a group of companies that they put us in, which is with Hulu."", ""We've not been able to package in the same way. We don't have access to ESPN+. And so, you know, but we still believe that we're on track with respect to our 2025 plan, again, based off of the last quarter numbers that we provided in November."", ""SEANA SMITH: David, just pushing back just a bit, because I think you could, or people out there could, make the argument that, hey, this industry is more competitive than it had been a decade ago, two decades ago when you have the entrance of many of these larger tech giants. They are now on the playing field there. What's your response to that argument? The fact that it's not just anymore about some of these legacy players."", ""DAVID GANDLER: But it is, because if you think about what they've done, they've weaponized an American institution, which is the NFL. You cannot-- at least in my view, is they have these rights for the next eight to nine years going into 2030."", ""So, when you control 100% of the National Hockey League rights, national television rights, and 100%, at least as of today, the national NBA rights, 50% of NFL and college football, you're basically dealing with a group of companies that are controlling for now, at least, and for the foreseeable future, this industry, with a goal of colluding and ensuring that they maintain that type of control. What's interesting to me is, and I'm sure you would agree with this, is that no longer can they consider merging because that, obviously, would be a non-starter for any DOJ to consider."", ""So therefore, this is the next best option. Let's circumvent merging and just collude via this, I'll call it-- because they haven't named it yet, so I'll name it for you guys, which is sports cartel TV-- to really marginalize players like Fubo."", 'BRAD SMITH: This feels like a reversion back to some of the cable bundles that we had known in the past, but on streaming grounds. And I would love to know how consumers should perceive these partnerships that are moving forward?', ""DAVID GANDLER: Yeah. Well, look, I mean, if you look back to my shareholder letter of 2021-- I believe it's actually exactly maybe three years ago-- I said we were going to move from bundling to unbundling, to the eventual rebundling, of this content. We have conducted numerous surveys. We collect 2 billion data points a month."", ""And basically, what we found is that consumers, three out of four consumers prefer to watch content on an aggregated app versus a direct-to-consumer app. And I think these media companies are learning the hard way-- tens of billions of dollars of losses that they're asking us to subsidize-- that it doesn't work and that the churn rates are too high, the marketing costs are too high, the tech costs are too high. And so the only way to do this is to really stomp out competition."", ""And I think consumers should be very nervous about this because I think, historically, we've seen this playbook. Whether it's with email or with any other services, they start out either free or cheap. And very quickly, if you look at the compounded annual growth rates in terms of pricing for any services, you'll see how quickly they ramp up once they start to feel comfortable in a market."", ""So this is very bad for customers. They should really be upset about this. They should be worried about it. And, you know, we've set up a landing page, savemysports.com, really asking people to read the letter that we put out there to support free choice and competition. Because ultimately, it will benefit them.""]"

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 4, we have laid out our key messages for today's call. First, we are pleased to share that final results for 2023 exceeded the midpoint of our narrowed guidance, delivering $2.38 per share of operating earnings or almost 6% growth off of last year's guidance midpoint. This is the second year in our 2 years as a purely regulated T&D utility that we have delivered results in the top half of guidance. And that is despite historically mild weather in the Mid-Atlantic where PECO experienced its mildest year in the 50 years we have on record. We also executed exactly as expected on our financing plan, including issuing 1/3 of our original $425 million equity commitment. Operationally, we continue to set the bar for the industry. We closed out another year with leading performance setting records for performance at multiple utilities. As it pertains to our regulatory activity, we completed 3 rate cases last year and continue to make progress on the 3 others at Delmarva Power, Delaware, Pepco Maryland and Pepco D.C. We received the final order in BGE's second multiyear plan filing for rates effective 2024 to 2026. We were encouraged to receive an order that recognized the importance of investment in support of Maryland's energy goals and a thoughtful path towards decarbonization. We also reached a constructive settlement in Atlantic City Electric rate case. The increased revenue requirement will support its smart meter rollout, its EV smart program for easy and cost-efficient charger installation and other investments to maintain safety and reliability as well as improved service for our customers in New Jersey. Last, we received an order in ComEd's first multiyear rate plan, and it was a disappointing outcome. First, the order failed to recognize the financial cost of ComEd's investment despite nation-leading reliability and low customer rates. It adopted a significantly below average ROE, refused to reflect in rates the prudent share of equity and removed any return on our pension asset despite that asset delivering over $1 billion in customer benefit and counting. But more importantly, it rejected our grid plan which was carefully developed over almost 2 years through dozens of stakeholder workshops and presentations reaching over 1,000 people and bolstered by voluminous support in the rate case process. Support for the investment plan was very strong, up through the administrative law judge's proposed order. It's important to all of us that our working to meet our state's goals and serving our customers that we have a stable and certain regulatory environments, and we'll work with all of our stakeholders to achieve such an environment and ensure that Illinois is a state that investors are comfortable committing to. As such, a key focus of this team for 2024 will be regaining momentum in Illinois and resolving some of this uncertainty. It is in no one's interest particularly those in the Illinois communities we serve and live in for the state to lose further ground in its opportunity to lead the energy transformation and forgo significant economic opportunity. We will be working diligently with stakeholders to get it back on track. Jeanne will cover more of the detail around Illinois shortly, and additional details on other rate cases can be found in the appendix. Our last key message pertains to our projected outlook. Consistent with past practice, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window, with our guidance running from 2024 through 2027. You'll see that we have added $3.2 billion of capital to our 4-year outlook, growing from $31.3 billion over the 2023 to 2026 guidance period to $34.5 billion over 2024 to 2027, an increase of over 10%. This reflects a number of updates across the platform to meet customer needs and jurisdictional goals. Including the addition of transmission investments assigned from the brand insurer's retirement and awarded in PJM's third RTEP reliability window to resolve reliability issues from data center growth in the region. These additions are partially offset by the reduction of approximately $1.25 billion in ComEd distribution spend. While we are working to finalize the revised grid plan for our March filing, we believe our plan appropriately accounts for the uncertain regulatory outlook while ensuring customers continue to receive safe and adequate service, and we meet the basic requirements laid out under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This increase in capital expenditures result in rate base growth of 7.5% from 2023 to 2027. And as a result of the significant increase in investment, we have included in our 4-year projections; incremental equity of $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the net incremental capital and ensures we maintain a strong balance sheet as we lead the energy transformation. In addition, despite below average returns we are receiving at ComEd, we continue to expect to realize a consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range. The result of the plan is an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. Now lowering our earnings growth outlook is not a change we took lightly, particularly given the amount of investment needed for this multi-decade energy transformation and our unique scale and platform to lead that work. Reducing investment in ComEd as a result of the final quarter lowered our expected rate base growth but it also provided us an additional opportunity to deploy capital in other parts of the system across our 7 jurisdictions to serve our customers, particularly in transmission. I'll note that the financial benefits of these investments do take longer to play out. Given the larger scale and scope of transmission projects, they require more time to generate cash and earnings relative to the distribution investments they are replacing. But we are confident that we can deliver at the midpoint or better of our annualized growth rating -- growth rate change of 5% to 7% over the 2023 to 2027 horizon and beyond, even after accounting for the potential that the uncertain process in Illinois may require significant further adjustments. And once again, Jeanne will speak more to these updates to our long-term outlook shortly. Lastly, for 2024, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.40 to $2.50 per share. This range gives us confidence that we can accommodate a variety of outcomes through the ComEd rehearing and grid plan processes, along with our typical risk and opportunities we see across our platform. We have also announced an annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024, reflecting 5.5% growth off of our $1.44 dividend per share in 2023, in line with our long-term earnings growth and approximately 60% payout ratio. Moving to Slide 5. I will review the 2023 commitments and priorities that we initiated on last year's fourth quarter call and recognize the significant progress we made across all of the areas that we prioritize as a pure-play transmission and distribution utility, which is leading the energy transformation. First, it was another tremendous year operationally. You can see this not only in our scorecard, but the industry recognizes it as well. As we mentioned in our last call, ComEd won PA Consulting's ReliabilityOne Award as the country's most reliable utility. The best ever performance at ComEd and Pepco Holdings speaks to the high quality of our workforce and our efforts to attract, engage and retain talent. We also met all of our financial goals. We invested $7.3 billion of capital to serve our customers. We earned a 9.3% return on equity, well within the targeted range of 9% to 10% that we target earnings on a consolidated basis. And as I mentioned, we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We executed as promised on our strategy to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet. We issued 1/3 of our existing equity commitment, raised debt at attractive interest rates at both our operating companies and holding company, and we took advantage of a variety of hedging instruments. We were very active and extremely successful in securing grants enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, securing close to $200 million in awards to support grid resiliency and modernization, at BGE, PECO and ComEd that will make our jurisdictions progress on their energy goals more affordable and equitable. And further, to the focus on customer affordability, we again helped secure $550 million of federal, state and local support for low-income customers that need assistance in paying their energy bills. We also made significant progress in our efforts to maximize value for our customers, institutionalizing a permanent team to discover and execute on opportunities to deliver industry-leading operational excellence for our customers at lower cost, which you'll hear more about from Jeanne. Lastly, we executed on a busy regulatory calendar, setting a rate case -- a rate case at ACE concluding another successful multiyear plan for BGE's electric and gas customers that aligns on an appropriate investment strategy for the next 3 years, and making substantial progress in our Delmarva Power electric rate case and Pepco multiyear plans. As we talked about, while we completed our ComEd rate case, it was a disappointing outcome for all parties. But we've already begun to establish and execute on a path forward, and that's become our top priority in 2024. I will now turn to Slide 6 to review how we closed out 2023 from an operational perspective. Starting first with reliability. We again kept outage frequency and duration at top quartile levels or above. ComEd and Pepco Holdings operated at best on record levels in both categories. Performance like this is not something that can be turned on and off overnight. First, it takes a talented and trained workforce. As I mentioned earlier, and we thank the teams that show up each and every day no matter the conditions to can -- keep the lights on and the gas flowing as they did during the severe storms and brutal cold snap that struck in January. Across ComEd, PECO and PHI, over 500,000 customers were impacted, and it takes investment. The demands placed on our system by more severe weather by an increasingly distributed and non-dispatchable generation fleet and by an economy that's more and more reliant on electricity, they all require investment. That's why it's so important to us to have stable and certain regulatory environments. It gives us the confidence to execute on forward-looking planning to manage the pace of investment for the energy transformation and ensure the reliability that all customers deserve and rightly expect. On safety, performance will continue to be a critical area of attention for us in 2024. Our OSHA performance was lacking in 2023 and we remain highly focused on understanding and correcting drivers of underperformance at each of our utility operating companies. The biggest drivers across all of our utilities continue to remain in the day-to-day basics like ergonomics and vehicle-related incidents, not the high energy events that truly differentiate utility work and demand particular focus. But this substandard performance even in the lower impact areas is not acceptable, and I expect us to do better in 2024. Customer satisfaction almost universally improved in the fourth quarter with ComEd rising into the first quartile. We are pleased that our efforts to ensure our customers see value in the service we provide are paying off, and we look forward to continuing this progress well into 2024. And finally, gas odor response remained at the dollar levels. And we continue to deliver on what we have here, and I'm so proud of the BGE, PECO and Pepco team -- and Delmarva teams. There was a lap for our employees to be proud of in 2023. We know we have what it takes to be a premier utility, and we execute it like one. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to speak more about our financial and regulatory update. With that, Jeanne?"", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our fourth quarter and full year results key regulatory developments in Illinois and across the platform and provide annual updates to our financial disclosures, including 2024 guidance. Starting on Slide 7. As Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the second year in a row despite the historically mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions. For the fourth quarter, Exelon earned $0.62 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year 2023, we earned $2.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our narrowed guidance range, and represent almost 6% growth off the midpoint of the 2022 guidance range. Throughout the year, we benefited from a higher earned ROE at ComEd, primarily due to rising treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE as well as favorable depreciation of PECO relative to expectations. Additionally, the ruling in December on BGE's reconciliation from its first multiyear plan approved recovery for over 90% of the requested 2021 and 2022 amounts and established a precedent to record a portion related to the 2023 reconciliation, which is expected to be determined in a future proceeding. These benefits, coupled with our ability to manage our plans across the platform allowed us to mitigate nearly $140 million of weather and storm challenges relative to prior year, along with the labor strike in New Jersey that occurred late in the year, driving contracting costs up year-over-year. In a year in which we faced multiple headwinds, we delivered on our goal to achieve earnings in the top half of our guidance range. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix on Slides 30 and 31. Turning to our outlook for 2024. We are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, with BGE and Pepco entering the next cycles of their multiyear plan, 2024 earnings are expected to grow approximately 4% relative to the midpoint of our 2023 original guidance range. Compared to our last update, the reduction in expected year-over-year earnings growth is driven solely by the December 14 rate order issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission and ComEd multiyear rate plan. which we were only able to partially mitigate in '24 with cost management, redirected investment to serve our customers and margin we had built up in the plan. Outright rejection of the grid plan, the challenging financial support for our net distribution investment in the December order and uncertainty around the amount of spend ComEd will be able to recover has caused us to dramatically reduce the originally planned level of distribution investment in Illinois this year. Until there is resolution on the grid plan, our 2024 plan has been risk adjusted for the overall uncertainty and prudently assumes earnings at ComEd consistent with the December rate order. While the rehearing on the interim revenue requirement is expected to provide additional cost recovery and so grid plan approval, we have not assumed this as our base case. Therefore, despite the uncertainty that remains at ComEd, we expect our 2024 range to cover a range of possible outcomes, from not receiving any rate relief relative to the final order to the prospect that we receive an approval of our revised grid plan. The uncertainty in Illinois will further cause volatile quarterly earnings shaping in '24, both due to the significant rework of ComEd's operational plan in '24, as well as due to the fact of the prospects for the rehearing and revised grid plan processes to impact ComEd's expected revenue requirements. We currently expect to realize approximately 29% of full year earnings in the first quarter, which accounts for the December rate order ComEd, seasonal weather patterns and the completed rate cases at our other utilities. Moving to Slide 9. I would like to take a moment to step through the regulatory developments in Illinois since receipt of the ITC's final order in mid-December. First, starting with the application for rehearing on December 22, ComEd acted swiftly to request the commission correct fundamental legal and evidentiary errors around 4 primary issues with the final order: Return on equity, capital structure, return on pension assets and the basis of the ordered revenue requirement across all test years that was adopted absent an approved grid plan. At an open meeting on January 10, the ICC granted one portion of ComEd's application, directing that 150-day rehearing process reconsider the year-over-year revenue requirement increases absent an approved grid plan. While ComEd anticipates that the revenue requirements will be further updated upon approval of our revised grid plan, the rehearing order due on June 10 is expected to reset interim rates for 2024 at the discretion of the commission. Immediately following the open meeting on January 10, ComEd filed with the third District Appellate Court, and appeal of the three other elements of the ICC's final order on which rehearing was denied. While there is no set schedule or deadline for an appeal conclusion, we will seek to move expeditiously through the core process. Separately, as directed in the final order, ComEd will file a revised grid plan by March 13. ComEd has fully reengaged staff and all parties to the proceeding to align on the appropriate adjustments to the revised grid plan to fully address the concerns expressed by the commission. We continue to believe significant investment is needed to support Illinois' clean energy goals and desire to promote economic development in the state, a fact acknowledged by all stakeholders. But the revised growth plan we expect to file will reflect the significantly below average financial support provided in the final order and address the commission's feedback to further prioritize affordability. We simply cannot invest at the same pace under an ROE that does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate and inflation environment. There is no statutory deadline for Commission action on the revised grid plan. However, final order stated that the Commission appreciates the urgency of having a compliant grid plan in place, and is eager to move forward with the grid plan that satisfies the statutory requirements for approval. And so we are optimistic for resolution by year-end.In response to the challenging rate order, our long-term guidance reflects a $1.25 billion reduction in ComEd distribution capital expenditures over the 3-year period spanning 2024 to 2026 relative to our Q4 2022 disclosure update. This updated investment outlook for ComEd's distribution business includes reductions agreed to with stakeholders, leading up to last October's proposed order. Along with additional reductions to result in a plan that further balances priorities across our stakeholders. As I will discuss later, around our long-term outlook, our guidance has accounted for the possibility that substantially more capital is removed from the plan as a result of this process despite significant broad-reaching support for our investment strategy. On Slide 10, we provide our updated outlook for CapEx and rate base, covering 2024 to 2027. We plan to invest $7.4 billion in 2024 and a total of $34.5 billion over the next 4 years. An increase of $3.2 billion or over 10% from the prior planning period. So we reduced ComEd's distribution capital plan by over 18% in response to the final order. The multi-decade energy transformation continues to gain momentum, and we see no shortage of needs to invest for our customers across all of our service territories and an ability to do so at a reasonable cost. We are the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer count, and we have the privilege and responsibility to serve many major densely populated areas. We operate 6 utilities across 7 jurisdictions, including FERC. And beyond our industry-leading size and scale, we are also one of the best operators in this sector, providing a world-class customer experience for reliability at very competitive rates. Given the power of this platform, our updated 4-year capital plan includes $3.2 billion of additional capital, net of the adjustments to common distribution to serve our customers. Included in that increase is $1.5 billion of incremental transmission capital over the 2023 to 2026 period since our last disclosure update. Addressing the significant need for high-voltage investments to support federal, state and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification. $725 million of that increase is projected at ComEd for data center and other high intense new build growth, along with increasing renewables and retirements of older fossil fuel generation is driving increased transmission investment needs. The balance of the additional transmission largely relates to the 2 large transmission projects discussed on prior earnings calls. The RTEP reliability Window 3 projects awarded by PJM to mitigate reliability challenges driven by incremental data center demand in the region and the other assigned due to the retirement of the brand insurance [coal plant]. While some of the transmission capital at ComEd is expected to go in service during the guidance period, very little of the transmission spend for the large East Coast project is reflected in the updated rate base outlook. Brand Insurance is expected to go into service in 2028, while the RTEP Window 3 project will be in service closer to 2030, providing line of sight to strong rate base growth beyond the current guidance window. We continue to expect there will be transmission opportunity across our service territories associated with the same drivers underpinning these projects, high-density, localized load growth, traditional fossil fuel plant retirements increased renewables, not to mention from our extremely well-positioned footprint on the Mid-Atlantic Coast for offshore wind interconnection. To further put our competitive position into perspective, all but 1 mile of those 2 large transmission projects is expected to occur on our existing rightways. We expect to remain active in seeking additional opportunities to lead in this space. And as always, we will only include spend in our plan that is identified and expected to proceed tied to the needs of our jurisdictions. In total, our capital plan updates are expected to result in an increase to rate base of 7.5% over the next 4 years on a compound annual growth basis to $74 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.5 billion to rate base from 2024 through 2027 and reflects a shift in the mix of our total capital growth portfolio by 2% from distribution to transmission since the last disclosure update despite a significant portion of the transmission capital added, not yet placed in service. Exelon's transmission rate base growth recovered through FERC formula rate provides a stable and predictable financial profile. As clean energy and electrification continue to grow, our transmission strategy is designed to adapt to this new paradigm, while continuing to operate the transmission system at world class levels. Moving to Slide 11. One way to ensure sustainability of our capital growth profile is to continue delivering superior value as efficiently as possible to our customers and communities. And as One Exelon, we are building from a strong foundation. Our history of steady cost discipline while delivering a premier experience for our customers has positioned us very well, as you can see in the chart on the right. Exelon's investment in grid modernization has enabled an approximate 40% increase in reliability performance across the platform, whether based on outage frequency or outage duration, while maintaining average electric rates 17% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. More simply put, when a dollar is placed in our hands to invest, our customers can trust us to create value through reliable, affordable service. Had our adjusted O&M costs growing in line with historical annualized inflation rate of 3.5% from 2016 through 2024, they would have increased by approximately $1.2 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 2.4% CAGR for the same period, eliminating $400 million of customer rate increases that would have occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. And while 2024 is expected to grow at a higher rate, one key driver is the number of significant back office and operational IT system investments whose savings will be monetized over a longer period of time, as I'll discuss in a minute. In addition, upon aligning with several of our jurisdictions on the spending programs associated with advancing their state's energy goals and priorities, through the recently approved rate cases, we are anticipating some catch up to meet the levels of service and investment agreed upon with our jurisdictions. However, we expect to maintain an annualized growth rate of approximately 2% through 2027, a below inflation level that is expected to result in bills to our customers over $400 million lower than they otherwise would have been. Our expectation is to limit the annualized O&M growth rate to approximately 2% over the long term and maintain our competitive position with rates among those that are the lowest in the nation, will improve our customers' experiences. In fact, our multiyear plan rate structures allow us to quickly flow any benefits back to customers. Let me take a moment to highlight a few ways in which we continue delivering value for our customers. First, as Calvin mentioned, a permanent team has established in 2023 to continue efforts to standardize and streamline the structure and operations of the organization, ensuring all of our efforts are coordinated with the sole purpose of serving our customers and communities in an efficient and superior manner. Second, we have several initiatives underway to upgrade major enterprise resource planning, customer billing and automated work order systems expected to create work efficiencies, some of which I mentioned are driving our spend in '24. Third, we are standardizing storm response protocol to increase rolled transparency and accountability and emergency events, mitigating cost risk and improving restoration performance in the future. Fourth, we are delivering a framework to migrate from a preventive maintenance, asset management strategy to an automated condition-based maintenance strategy in our transmission operations. And lastly, we are streamlining processes and leveraging technology, particularly in the call center and field for increased efficiency and responsiveness to our customers. To ensure that (inaudible) remain strong and we can invest at the levels our jurisdictions want, we are committed to leveraging our size and scale as One Exelon to manage costs across our operating companies and deliver affordable rates for our customers. Turning to Slide 12. With $34.5 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.5% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%. We are initiating an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. The lower growth outlook from what we previously laid out is not a decision we took lightly, but is a result of the challenging rate case outcomes and decelerated piece of investment in Illinois. As you heard from Calvin, Illinois is only one jurisdiction in which we operate. We are continuing momentum in our other jurisdictions as the second multiyear plans at Pepco progressed in line with our expectations, as PECO anticipates filing in the first half of this year, consistent with our general 2- to 3-year rate case cadence and does all of our utilities execute on the robust transmission strategy and cost management initiatives outlined on the prior slide. Accordingly, we are confident that our earnings CAGR will be at midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% range over the 2023 to 2027 period and in future updates. Even with the process in Illinois remaining uncertain, our earnings growth guidance is resilient and account for the possibility that limited progress is made in Illinois, and we need to significantly reduce investment in common distribution further. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout ratio of operating earnings, with the dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings target. We announced today an expected annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in '24 which is over 5.5% higher than the 23% dividends. Maintaining our commitment to transparency and predictability, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2027 on Slide 13. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the 4-year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our expected 5% to 7% growth through 2027, including an expectation to deliver every year after '24 within the 5% to 7% range, if not above. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide 14. As you have heard from us before, maintaining a strong balance sheet is core to our strategy, and we closed out another year with credit metrics comfortably exceeding S&P's and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%. Similar to the first 2 years since operation, over the guidance period, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. While the final rate order issued by the commission in Illinois negatively impacted our future cash flow outlook, we have largely mitigated those impacts through cost management and curtailment of distribution capital spend at ComEd, while ensuring we maintain a safe, reliable growth for customers. As we identify new investments in the plan, we are funding in a prudent manner by incorporating an incremental $1.3 billion of equity to ensure we maintain our previous commitment on cushion and keep us on a path to 13% to 14% consolidated credit metrics over time. As our consolidated spend profile has shifted more towards transmission, the cash generated from these longer-dated investments is expected to follow the earnings largely beyond the guidance period and further strengthen our credit metrics over time. Additionally, I'd remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax will not allow for repairs is implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact. We'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics average -- on average over the plan, which would provide incremental cushion. From a financing perspective, we expect the $34.5 billion capital plan to be supported by $19 billion of internally generated cash flow. $10 billion of debt at the utilities and $3 billion of debt at the holding company with the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed $142 million of equity via our ATM and expect $150 million to be issued in 2024. And as mentioned, to fund the robust $3.2 billion of incremental capital opportunities while maintaining a strong balance sheet, our financing plan includes $1.3 billion of additional equity that we expect to issue over the '25 through '27 period. The incremental equity funds 40% of the incremental capital investments over the 4-year plan and represent slightly more than 1% per year of Exelon current market cap. As we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment of utilities, we anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by no more than approximately 40% equity. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $35 billion of capital across our diversified platform from '24 to '27, driving 5% to 7% earnings growth from '23 to '27 with an expectation of midpoint or better and maintaining a strong balance sheet while doing so. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Thank you, Jeanne. I'd like to conclude with our priorities and commitments for this year and remind you of Exelon's unique value proposition for their jurisdictions it serves and its investors. As you'll see, they're very consistent with our focus areas for 2023, a good reminder that we aim to reliably deliver against a predictable and consistent strategy, as you'd expect from a premier utility. First, you can count on us to prioritize operational excellence and safety in service of our customers. As you may have seen, we announced the creation of a Chief Operating Officer position and named Mike Innocenzo, the CEO of PECO to that role. Mike will build on the top-tier performance levels, our customers have come to expect. And in succeeding him, Dave Velazquez, will bring his wealth of experience and strong leadership to PECO. Both moves are a testament to the unparalleled bench strength that Exelon enjoys. And our Chief Human Resource Officer, Amy Best, has been instrumental in building that advantage. We wish her all the best in her next chapter and look forward to Denise Galambos' leadership as Exelon's new Head of HR. Second, we expect to deliver on the prudent financial plan that we have laid out. Spending $7.4 billion to invest in the grid on behalf of our customers and communities, earning a consolidated return on equity in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with the cost of investing in the grid, and delivering earnings in the range of $2.40 and $2.50 per share while maintaining a strong balance sheet in executing our financing strategy. Next, we expect to reach collaborative and constructive outcome in the rate cases we have underway, along with the ones we expect to initiate in 2024 to ensure we can continue to deliver safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers and help the states make their desired progress on their energy goals. And we will continue our efforts to ensure the energy transformation is as equitable and affordable as possible. Building on our success in 2023 in mid-January, we submitted 7 concept papers for the next $3.9 billion that the Department of Energy's grid deployment office is making available under its GRIP program enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, with proposals ranging from software across the enterprise to enable increasing levels of distributed renewable energy sources to target an investment at Pepco Holdings to combat coastal impacts of climate change. They highlight our creative and far-reaching efforts to partner with our jurisdictions and creatively align local state and federal policy. And beyond accessing these funding sources, as Jeanne highlighted, we will continue our efforts to standardize and simplify our operations to manage the increases in costs associated with the expanding needs of the grid while delivering premium value to our customers. Lastly, what's distinct this year is a recognition that last December's final order in the ComEd multiyear plan did not bring the resolution on how to invest over the coming years in the first rate case process undertaken by the approach laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. But while we are disappointed, we are not deterred. We are committed to finding a path forward with stakeholders that restore certainty for our customers, employees and investors. We believe everyone wants a level of investment that can deliver on the promise of CEJA and positions us to lead the energy transformation. And so will we be working toward that outcome while preparing to pivot if that's not the case. Delivering against these priorities while continuing to establish our position as a premier T&D utility, and Slide 16 reinforces that value that we offer. Exelon's platform is incredibly unique. We have the privilege and responsibility of serving some of the nation's greatest cities with jurisdictions that recognize the unique opportunity they have to lead the energy transformation. Our asset footprint, the transmission and distribution network that is the lifeblood of making that transformation happen for our jurisdictions is unmatched. As is our scale with over 10.5 million customers across our 7 ratemaking jurisdictions. We have been setting the bar for operational performance for years and our ability to invest to support that performance is backed by strong, forward-looking and predictable regulatory mechanisms. With our dividend yield at 4.5% and a 5% to 7% annualized earnings growth rate that we have a strong conviction in achieving, we are offering investors total shareholder returns in the 9.5% to 11.5% range and extremely attracted risk-adjusted proposition. I am so proud of this team for the commitments made and kept in 2023, and we look forward to doing the same in 2024. As always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Calvin, starting with Illinois, I mean the team has had a few months now to digest the order. You're not alone in facing sort of that disorder from the ICC. I mean both the electric and gas guys have throttled investments and they've laid off workers. I guess what did you guys miss heading into that final order? But really more importantly, why is this current distribution spend now appropriate? Is it a floor kind of positioned for upside in Jeanne's comments for '24 kind of broad with upside and downside. So just trying to handicap the path forward with this new guidance."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Yes. Thank you, Shar. And as both Jeanne and I expressed, disappointed with the outcome. And the disappointment, I'll frame it first, that despite the high level of engagement with stakeholders, and the administration around the state's policy and alignment. And with the passage of the Climate Equitable and Jobs Act, the work that the team put in, and I need to give credit to Gil Quiniones and his team for the amount of effort that they put in. Let me take a moment to remind you of the steps that we're taking leading up to that final order, and we were tracking. Leading up January 2023 filing, Shar, we participated in 15 ICC led workshops with hundreds of participants. We responded to more than 10,000 data requests during that 11-month rate process, and we ended up with a proposed order that granted almost 80% -- 79% or so of our revenue requirement ask with only a $350 million gap in rate base or about 2% by 2027. But part of that process with all those stakeholders, the one group that we hadn't heard from was the Illinois Commerce commissioners themselves. Well, now we have. And our job is to align with what they are requesting. And we jumped right back in, as Jeanne outlined, into that stakeholder process. Gil and his team are meeting on a regular basis with those stakeholders to lay it out and to meet the objectives that CEJA requires and what the commissioners want. And they outlined affordability, reliability, which their common goals. Now it's just a matter of how do we get there. So to your question, what confidence do we have? We are building a plan to achieve those goals, and we will continue to talk with those stakeholders. But as Jeanne also laid out, we are ready to pivot, if required. What I can tell you with assurance is that this 5% to 7% earnings growth is premised on multiple outcomes. We're taking those things into consideration, and we'll be able to make those adjustments. But we're going to put together and are putting together a plan to meet all of those objectives. But let me just be very clear. Our priorities are the following: provides safe and reliable electricity for the citizens of Illinois and maintain a healthy, financially strong company. In that partnership, we think we can achieve there. we can achieve those goals. And we don't believe those goals are any different than the Illinois Commerce Commission. We heard their voice, and now we're leaning into that discussion. Jeanne, anything you'd like to add?"", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Yes. I'll just -- I think I'll address Shar's second part of that question. So '24 to your point, Shar, we've provided a guidance range with a midpoint that assumes the [12-14-23] order. We have the rehearing process going on, which is about an interim revenue requirement while the grid plan is being approved. And then we have the grid plan process, which will kick off and we filed that on March 13. Depending on those outcomes, there could be upside to the '24 if we get an interim revenue requirement or a grid plan approved, but the midpoint assumes the December order. Now beyond '24, we did approve the -- or sorry, we did assume that the grid plan would be approved. It is a grid plan that, as Calvin mentioned, is focused on safe, reliable operations and alignment on the progress in CEJA, it's lower, right? We're not going to be able to make as much progress on CEJA, just given the unfavorable economics. But we do want to make progress and we will. Now there is not a set time line for the commission to opine on the grid plan. But we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are optimistic it gets done this year. The commission stated that in their order in December that they understand the sense of urgency. And so while it does assume that the grid plan is approved, '25 to '27, we are prepared if we cannot get alignment to make further reductions and still deliver."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Good morning. So I guess just to kind of clarify on the CapEx plan. I mean the plan is $3 billion can change higher, to your point. I guess your '26 rate base does seem like it is lower, though plan over plan. So I guess, could you just help us kind of clarify what's maybe driving that? I know there's probably some moving pieces in the starting point for ComEd rate base, but -- yes."", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Yes, it's really the difference between the distribution. So pulling back on the distribution investments and then replacing it with transmission. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. There's kind of two slices of it. There's the awards we've been talking about, the brand insurers and the RTEP Window, where, those projects will close in 2028 and at the end of '28 for brand insurers and then 2030 for the RTEP window. And so those will go into rate base outside of the planning period. And so as we move distribution out and layer those in, you're not seeing the one-for-one offset rate base. We do have other transmission that will close within the period, but it is back-end loaded. And as you know, right, transmission doesn't have, even if it's closed within that year, right, it doesn't have the same impact on distribution. So it's really just the shift that we made from D2C."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, maybe you can help us understand on the financing, really not much equity to do in '24. Just where does your balance sheet stand for '24 relative to the agency minimums? And just what's the feedback been from the agencies on this new plan and maintaining the stable outlook."", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Yes. Yes, no problem. So I think the message is consistent with how we talked about it last year. So we had said over the planning period, we expect to be at 100 basis points of cushion absent CAMT. And if we get the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax alleviated, we'd be back into sort of the middle of that range. Obviously, a couple of things happened since we last spoken; first the ComEd order. And with that order, we did see an impact to our balance sheet. We then mitigated that impact largely, not one-for-one, but we had a substantial mitigation through the reduction of the distribution spend as well as O&M reductions and looking at pension contributions and other things to kind of pull all the things we could to make sure we got back up and mitigate as much as we could, a large portion of that ComEd order. The other piece was layering in the new capital. As we layered in that new capital and funding it with about 40% equity, we were able to kind of maintain that cushion that we wanted, right, that 100 basis points. Now if you think about it from a year-over-year perspective, as we've also talked about in the past, I think we expect the front end of the plan to be a little bit lower, particularly on the Moody's side, still about the threshold. But lower in '24 and getting better over the planning period, mostly due to some of the cash recovery regulatory mechanisms like the formula rate true-up for '23 that will come in '25. And then -- so that kind of -- that's why we show you that average. But at the average of 13%. And then again, I would say the impact of the equity starts to sort of build on itself. And so as you get to the back end of the planning period and beyond, that is helpful in terms of continuing to bolster that cushion. But then also as those transmission projects close, the cash flows, they are also beneficial to the metrics."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""So just I know you're engaging with a lot of the parties, as you said, in Illinois. Just -- is there any chance you could settle some of these issues? Or do we need to just let the commission kind of rule on everything? And is there any -- beyond just the order they gave, is there any opportunity to get a better sense from them, the commission level, what they want, are we just going to have to kind of wait for a fine water."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Yes. No, thank you, Steve. I'll start with this, and then I have with me Gil Quiniones, who's the CEO of ComEd to really weigh in here as well. My view on this settlement, as I mentioned, Gil and his team are engaged with the stakeholders. We may read some settlement in discussions with stakeholders about what they're looking for, and we would submit it to the commission. But I think overall, a settlement in principle on the rate case, I think, is unlikely. The process will continue to play out. And the fact that we are in the midst of a pending proceeding, we cannot speak directly nor should we, with the commissioners themselves. So our view of what they -- where they stand came in the form of their December 14 order, and we have a clear understanding. But what we can do and what we are doing is engaging with staff. Consistently talking again as we did for the last 2 years. We're back reengaged in that process. And what we are providing them and sharing with them and then I'll turn it over to Gil is under the tenets of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the need to align policy and practice, what the law says and what we need to do to carry it out seek some alignment between the legislative body and the commission to accomplish the shared goals of all of us. And that is our conversation from day 1, and that will continue to be based on the feedback that they've given. Gil, anything you want to add?"", 'Gil C. Quiniones', ""Yes. Calvin, and Steve, What's different now is that it's very clear in the final order what they identified as things that complied with the law and things that the commission thinks there are gaps. So one by one, we are making sure that we're addressing those gaps in the final order. Second, as Calvin said, we're working very closely with staff and each of the intervenors in this case to make sure that we have alignment. In some cases, some intervenors have very specific areas that they would like for us to address. And as Calvin said, in those cases, we may have alignment where we can stipulate in our testimony that we have arrived at an agreement with those specific issues. So we're making sure that we are addressing what the final order set, where the gaps are. We're working very closely with staff to make sure we have alignment with them. And then we're working with each of the intervenors in the case for their very specific issues that they want included in our grid plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Just wanted to follow up real quickly on some of the Nick's cash questions real quickly. Can you guys comment a little bit? I mean, FFO looking through the 4-year window here, a little bit better than the prior plan. And that's in spite of obviously some of the rate base dynamics, et cetera, but it looks like a $2 billion bump to CFO there helps the balance sheet. But can you talk about that a little bit further here? And then also maybe if you can to elaborate on some of the earlier questions, I mean, where do you guys overall within the plan? I know that you articulated here given years up and down. But overall, are you in the lower end or the midpoint, if you will, of the updated EPS."", 'Calvin Butler', ""So let me take the last part first, and then I'll turn it over to Jeanne. So as we talk about the 5% to 7% earnings growth, we are committed to midpoint or better. And I think Jeanne even referenced at least, right? So this is a plan that we've put together that's very prudent and our ability to achieve it. And we've demonstrated as an organization, we can take on headwind and continue to meet the target. As I said, Julien, so proud of the team and the commitments made and commitments kept, right? And we will continue to do that. You think about what we had to overcome in 2023 to deliver in excess of our midpoint to [238]. So that's the commitment there. And I'll let Jeanne talk about the additional equity and balance sheet and so forth."", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Yes. And then Julien, we do also continue to show you, Julien, the year by year, which gets you to that midpoint or better. So again, there will still be some years above the range, years within the range, all within the range, but some different points to get you to that mid-screen or better, as Calvin mentioned, that side continues in the deck. On the balance sheet, I guess, I would characterize a little bit different. I think we're consistent with where we were. So we had expected to be at the 100 basis points of cushion. We expect to continue to maintain that 100 basis points. We largely mitigated the ComEd order through our own internal levers. And then as we layered in the capital to maintain that cushion, we funded it in a balanced way by layering in that 40% of every new dollar of equity."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Got it. And through the plan, you're assuming consistent authorized equity ratios and returns to get to that midpoint or better?"", 'Jeanne M. Jones', 'We are assuming the authorized, yes, for each of the jurisdictions on the cap structure.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS.', 'Ross A. Fowler', ""I want to acknowledge before I ask my question, that there is upside to the Illinois process, but I wanted to spend a minute on, Jeanne, I think what you talked about is the downside to the forecast and the risks in Illinois versus the plan. You did a great job mitigating some of that today with the transmission CapEx to replace sort of the distribution CapEx. But that was a lot of brownfield transmission that we've been talking about for a while and even that is sort of back-end loaded in the forecast and Greenfield would presumably take even longer. So maybe you can continue to do that if there's downside to distribution CapEx in that ComEd in the plan, but what are the other levers that you could pull here? Is that lower equity as CapEx declines? Is that lower O&M? How do I think about what levers you have at your disposal to sort of offset that downside risk should that be outcome (inaudible)?"", 'Jeanne M. Jones', ""Yes. I think I get a couple of parts there. I would say, one, for every plan that we put forth always prudently include some sort of -- for lack of a better word, cushion, right? So we're not -- we've got a bunch of scenarios that we're modeling and we're making sure that we can deliver regardless of where the final grid plan comes out. I would say at the low ROEs, right? It takes a lot of capital at ComEd, to make it on the distribution side, to make it a meaningful impact up or down, and we're prepared to pull back if we need to. And to your point then, that could have further impacts from a financing, savings and other things. Obviously, we would always look for O&M levers as well as we have done in the past. I would say we -- portion of the transmission that we added, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, was not what we had talked about, it was new opportunities that we had on the list at ComEd related to the high-density localized low growth there on the data centers, continuing to modernize that portion of the grid. So these are needs that need to be addressed on our system. The other thing I would say is, as we talked about before, while we have the 2 opportunities that we mentioned, we continue to see where we operate in our jurisdiction potential for further transmission related to interconnection of offshore wind, whether it's the Maryland executive orders, the New Jersey executive orders. As those projects are built, given our footprint, we stand to be competitive for that. So I think there's other opportunities that exist. And the plan reflects the upside from continuing to execute on the grid plan, but also the ability to pull back. We also don't assume any of the performance metrics, right? I think we're going to make sure our growth plan is also set up to be able to capture some of those. Obviously, that's a metric, but we're going to do a -- work real hard to get some of that, and that's not included in the plan either."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Yes. And if I can just add, Ross, I think on what's critical, what Jeanne has said is that understanding Illinois is just one of our many jurisdictions in which we operate and what we continue to demonstrate in terms of the value of Exelon is our scale and size and the jurisdictions and the opportunities that exist across our platform. We always talk about the power of the platform, and you saw it flexed in 2023, and you'll see it flexed over our long-range plan from '24 to '27. So Illinois is a focal area. And as I shared with you, it's a priority for all of us. I know Gil and his team are fixed on it, but we have other businesses that we will continue to run and as always, manage our costs and to ensure that we do it in a very pragmatic basis. Thank you for the question."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO, for closing remarks."", 'Calvin Butler', ""Gigi, thank you very much. And more importantly, thank you to everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you in 2024 and as committed for the upcoming spring conferences, Jeanne and I and Andy, the IR team will be on the road. They promised me that we'd be doing that. Thank you, and I look forward to engaging with all of you. But more importantly, I just want to say to the 19,500 employees here at Exelon, thank you for everything that you guys do each and every day.

As a stalwart in the banking sector, M&T Bank Corp has demonstrated resilience and adaptability, catering to a diverse clientele across its extensive branch network. The bank's financial tables from the filing indicate a solid balance sheet, with a reclassification of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to better reflect their risk profile, and a strategic realignment into three reportable segments: Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, and Institutional Services and Wealth Management.

This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with market volatility and economic downturns. M&T's ability to offer a comprehensive suite of services enhances its appeal to a broad customer base and supports its financial stability."", ""Regional Economic Sensitivity: While M&T Bank Corp's concentrated focus on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions has been a source of strength, it also presents a weakness. The bank's performance is closely tied to the economic health of these areas, making it vulnerable to regional downturns. Any adverse economic conditions in these regions could lead to increased loan defaults, reduced demand for banking products, and overall financial strain on the institution."", 'Regulatory Challenges: The bank faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning climate-related financial risks and sustainability practices. The recent guidance from federal and state regulators requires M&T to enhance its risk management and reporting, which could result in increased compliance costs and operational complexities.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.34 = US$3.9b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 34%.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Colgate-Palmolive  for free."", ""In terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 43%, but they have dropped over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 45% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high."", ""Like most companies, Colgate-Palmolive does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", 'If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

And this number is only going to grow with time."", ""This isn't necessarily a bad thing."", 'SpaceX famously develops its products through iterative design, constantly upgrading them to lower cost, increase performance, or both. For example, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket ship in 2016 was advertised as launching less than 4.9 tons of payload to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) for $61 million. Today, upgraded ""Block 5"" Falcon 9s cost 10% more -- but carry 70% more cargo to GTO.', 'Likewise with Starlink satellites. As Payload Research explains in its 2024 ""The Starship Report,"" early versions of Starlink communications satellites massed just two or three hundred kilograms. Each such satellite could support about 23 gigabits per second-worth of download speed.', 'Newer ""V.2 Mini"" Starlinks are larger (as much as 800 kg), and boast four times the bandwidth. Musk has promised that as Starlink evolves toward a future full-sized ""V.2"" model, the mass will increase 5x from the earlier V.1 Starlink -- but bandwidth will grow ""almost an order of magnitude,"" a 10x increase.', ""Now, one reason SpaceX products increase in capability so quickly is that SpaceX doesn't keep some them around very long. Starlinks in particular have only a five-year lifespan, and are expected to fall out of LEO pretty regularly, to be replaced by new and improved models."", ""But there's a downside to this."", ""Simple math tells you that if a product has a 5-year lifespan, then 20% of that product (100 / 5) ages out of service every year. Now, this wasn't too noticeable back when Starlink started beta service with just 800 satellites. It's become more noticeable -- though still manageable -- today, with 5,000 Starlinks circling the globe."", 'If 1,000 of these birds age out and need to be replaced every year, and Starlink can replace them at a rate of 23 satellites per Falcon 9 launch, then 44 launches per year should do the trick. (Hint: SpaceX launched more than twice that number of flights last year.)', 'The problem is that SpaceX is progressing toward 12,000 Starlinks in orbit, requiring 2,400 satellites, meaning 104 launches per year to replace old satellites. At an estimated cost of $500,000 to build each satellite, plus $67 million per Falcon 9 to launch them, this implies an annual cost of about $8.2 billion per year -- just to keep the satellite constellation at full strength.', 'Now SpaceX, as you\'ve probably heard, is in the process of planning an IPO for Starlink, just as soon as its ""revenue growth is smooth & predictable.""', ""We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I'm a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it."", '-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 28, 2020', ""As investors begin weighing whether they're going to want to participate in that IPO when it happens, they may want to ask themselves: Can SpaceX afford to pay that kind of money, and still earn a profit from Starlink?"", 'Surprisingly, it can -- but the profit might not be as big as SpaceX hopes.', 'Consider: According to the latest data from Payload Research, Starlink generated $4.2 billion in revenue for SpaceX last year, and might double its 2023 numbers and collect $10 billion in revenue in 2024. By the time SpaceX has all 12,000 Starlink satellites in orbit (I estimate this might happen in late 2026 or early 2027), SpaceX internal documents suggest that Starlink revenue could exceed $32 billion.', 'That much revenue should easily cover the cost of building and launching as many Starlinks as SpaceX needs to keep the constellation fully stocked.', ""This, as the saying goes, is the good news. Now here's the bad news for SpaceX and its planned Starlink IPO:"", ""Although Starlink is on course to generate more than enough revenue to cover its equipment replacement costs. I can't help but notice that the $8 billion (ish) that Starlink will need to spend on maintenance capital expenditures (i.e. satellite replacement) still represents roughly 25% of the company's anticipated $32 billion revenue. Compare that to a terrestrial cable internet company like Comcast, though, and, well ... it turns out that Comcast's annual capex averaged less than 10% of its annual revenue over the last five years (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence)."", ""Now, it makes total sense that infrastructure on Earth would be cheaper to build and maintain than infrastructure in space. That's just logical. However, this still suggests that SpaceX's Starlink business may end up being less profitable for Elon Musk, than a more down-to-earth internet company like Comcast."", ""This may not be a reason to avoid a coming Starlink IPO entirely. But it does inject a note of caution -- and it's a good reason for investors to think twice before investing in any such IPO."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team\xa0has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That means I like companies whose standout feature is how many years in a row their dividends have been increased, often expressed in decades. This is the basic reason Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) will never find its way into my portfolio. But I have to admit that, for some investors, this company's dividend approach, which churns my stomach, might be just right. Here's what you need to know."", ""I normally don't even start looking at a company until it has increased its dividend annually for at least a decade. I make exceptions on rare occasions, but even then my preference is for companies that have long and consistent dividend records. The goal is to find a company that hasn't cut its dividend in a long time, or for which the cut is for some larger purpose with which I'm less concerned, like a spinoff."", ""I wish I could say this was something I came up with on my own. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants like Benjamin Graham, the man who helped to train Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. In Graham's seminal book The Intelligent Investor, he specifically tells conservative investors to focus on companies with strong dividend histories. It's a quick and dirty way to ensure that the company has a strong business and that management places a high value on its shareholders."", ""That brings us to Devon Energy. Over the past eight quarters, this energy company has increased its dividend four times and cut it four times. That's just not right for someone like me, who's trying to build a portfolio that produces a reliable income stream. To give an even more dramatic example of the risk I'd have to accept in owning Devon, the quarterly dividend at the low point over the past two years was $0.49 per share, with the highwater mark at $1.55. That's just too much variability for my taste, and I'd like to keep this one even further away than a 10-foot pole would allow."", ""Yet I have to admit that Devon Energy is actually a fairly well-run energy company. For example, it's one of the largest U.S. onshore energy producers. The company believes it has around 12 years' worth of drilling opportunities in its portfolio to support production and growth. And it has breakeven costs of around $40 a barrel of oil, which is pretty low. From this perspective, Devon is an attractive company."", ""The problem is that it has a variable dividend policy that ties the dividend to the company's financial performance. That, in turn, will rise and fall with oil and natural gas, the commodities it produces, which are highly volatile. While I'm not fond of this approach, it is a fairly direct way to ensure that shareholders benefit from energy price upturns. Of course, that requires taking the hit when energy prices inevitably fall."", ""But think about that for a second. Right when you'd be facing rising energy prices for gasoline and home heating, Devon Energy's dividend would probably be heading higher, too. That makes Devon something of a hedge for your real-world energy costs. More active investors might actually find that appealing. It's not for me, but it might be just perfect for some investors."", ""Devon Energy's dividend yield, which is around 6.6% today, almost doesn't matter, given the variable dividend policy. You just can't count on that dividend to stay the same. And that's why I'll never own this stock. But beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder. And that variable dividend could actually be just what you need to balance out the variable energy costs you face in filling your car and heating your home."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the different kinds of trading strategies and some latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""When it comes to trading, a strategy can typically follow two different directions. One of the more commonly understood trading strategies is trading by the fundamentals. This strategy looks at a firm's ability to make money, and it analyzes the income statement and the balance sheet to take stock of costs, assets, and other financial metrics that could hint at growth in the future and the corresponding share price appreciation."", 'The second direction or strategy is played by the technical indicators. As opposed to looking at fundamentals such as earnings per share or dividends, a technical trading approach instead analyzes share price trends and movements. It takes stock of a variety of factors such as the volume of shares traded, whether a stock is overbought or oversold if its share price is above or below long term averages, and the percentage of returns delivered by the price. By combining these factors, technical analysts believe that they capitalize on emerging market trends before they blow up and make a profit.', ""One kind of technical trading strategy is called momentum trading. For those out of the loop, analyzing a stock's momentum is unrelated to its balance sheet. Instead, it involves looking at the share price movements to see whether further upside or downside is present to merit an investment decision. Inside the momentum trader's toolkit are several 'tools' such as average directional indexes, moving averages, stochastic oscillators (also called a relative strength index (RSI)), and simple trend lines that gauge whether current share price levels are part of a broader upward or downward trend."", ""Together, these allow for informed decision making. For instance, let's consider a hypothetical stock A. A has an RSI reading of 19, a long term upward share price trend, and an ADX reading of 40. This might lead an investor to correctly conclude that since the RSI reading indicates that the stock is oversold, and the share price is trending upwards, then a high ASX reading could potentially present a chance for a profit since it indicates the presence of a trend. Of course, just as all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified investment professional, trying to read the technical tea leaves can yield better results if conclusions like the one in our example are also evaluated along with a fundamental reading. So if Stock A has high debt and falling revenue, then unless insiders or institutional investors know something that the broader market does not, it might not be worthwhile to wager holding A for a long time period."", ""With that out of the way, one way in which momentum stocks benefit is through the effects of macroeconomic news, events, and developments on the stock market. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the market has been held hostage by these events if we're being honest. Whether it's predictions of a recession, interest rate hikes, or high inflation, the market has seen investors flip between being bears and bulls depending on the nature of the data set. Right now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and the inflation readings for January 2024 that will help investors decide when the Fed might start cutting interest rates to ease business conditions and provide a further boost to the market."", 'Since the times are quite dynamic for the stock market, we decided to take a look at some top momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Partnership, for Public Storage. Thank you. Mr. Burke, you may begin.', 'Ryan C.

Russell', ""Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance, industry views and 2024 outlook. Then we'll open it up for Q&A.2023 was a year of significant achievement for Public Storage amidst a competitive industry environment. The team elevated our customer experience and financial profile through digital and operating model transformation. Enhanced existing properties with over 500 solar installations and the Property of Tomorrow program. Advanced complementary business lines, including tenant reinsurance and third-party management. And grew the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment.We did so while maintaining one of the real estate industry's best balance sheets, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow.Just a few of our collective accomplishments include: exceeding 3,000 owned properties and serving nearly 2 million in-place customers. Achieving an approximately 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of.Acquiring and quickly integrating the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio with approximately 90,000 customers across nearly 130 properties. This was the largest private acquisition in company history.Increasing the size of our high-growth non-same-store pool to 705 properties and 63 million square feet now comprising nearly 30% of our overall portfolio. Generating record revenues, net operating income and core funds from operations. Accelerating growth in third-party property management, adding 132 properties and reaching 324 properties in total. And receiving several accolades tied to sustainability including Nareit's Leader in the Light Award, a second consecutive Great Place to Work award and achieving top scoring benchmarks among U.S. self-storage REITs.The strength of our team, platform and brand was evident with move-in volumes up an impressive 9% in 2023, despite a backdrop of weaker customer demand during the year. The new customer environment remains challenging, but we have seen a degree of improvement in move-in rent trends recently. And our in-place customer base continues to perform well. with average length of stay that are longer than the historic norm.We expect demand from new customers to stabilize during 2024 and the behavior of existing customers including our recent move-ins to remain strong due to clear macro conditions, including the potential for a soft landing, the potential for easing interest rates, resilient consumers, leveling home sales and strong home renter behavior. We also anticipate fewer completions of new self-storage facilities nationally, reducing the competitive impact of new supply in our local markets. All in, the industry is in better position entering 2024 than it was entering 2023.The full Public Storage team is focused on exercising our competitive advantages, which include: advancing our digital and operating model transformation, expanding complementary businesses and creating partnerships across the broader industry, growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management. And funding innovation and growth today and into the future with the industry's best balance sheet.All of this adds to the growth of our business over the near, medium and long term. And it comes at a time with the potential for further stabilization in the move-in environment, existing customers exhibiting strong behavior and an outlook for new competitive supply that is clearly in our favor. With good trends in customer demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond.Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Thanks, Joe. On to financial performance. We finished the year reporting core FFO of $4.20 for the quarter and $16.89 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range representing 1% growth over the fourth quarter of '22, and 8.3% growth for 2023 overall, excluding the impact of PSB.Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, at the higher end of our expectation. That was driven by better move-in volume and move-in rate performance.On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 5.1% for the fourth quarter, largely driven by increases in marketing spend to support that move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 50 basis points in the quarter. Meanwhile, the non-same-store NOI grew 31% and 25% for the fourth quarter and '23, respectively, demonstrating the continued strength of our lease-up and nonstabilized assets.Now turning to the outlook for '24. We introduced 2024 core FFO guidance with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. As Joe mentioned, we entered the year more encouraged than we were last year at this time. We've seen the industry work through the declines in new customer demand from the peaks of 2021.We're anticipating that new customer demand stabilizes in 2024 as the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer. That paired with a consistently strong consumer and lower new competitive new supply.If we look at the same-store outlook for '24 specifically, the midpoint calls for revenue on par with '23.Similar to last year, move-in rates continue to be the biggest variable in the forecast heading through 2024 as well. We're anticipating at the midpoint case that move-in rents lap easier comps through the year, and crossed 0 on a year-over-year basis towards the end of the summer. And occupancy results down 80 basis points, which is roughly on top of 2019 occupancies as we sit here today. Our expectations are for 2.75% same-store expense growth driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of a decline of 90 basis points.Our nonsame-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2024, growing from $370 million of NOI contribution in '23 to $505 million at the midpoint and will grow from there in future years. In addition, embedded in the outlook is incremental acquisition and development activity, $500 million of acquisitions, and we plan to deliver a record $450 million of development in '24.Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains solid. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $400 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position heading into 2024.With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Thanks I. was wondering, Tom, if you could talk a little bit about the ECRIs that are maybe embedded in the high and low end of growth and how those may be compared to the ECRIs that you achieved in '23."", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. Happy to add that color, Steve. I think as you know, I'd like to speak about existing customer rent increases as a combination of customer price sensitivity as well as the cost to replace that customer if they vacate upon receiving a rental rate increase. And as we look at in 2024, there's a couple of things at play here. One is, as we enter the year, right, demand is a little weaker, we'll give you a January, February update here shortly, where move-in rents are down year-over-year as we start the year, similar to how we finished in 2023, that's going to lead to higher replacement costs through the first part of this year. That's going to be a little bit of a drag to ECRI performance.The flip side is, Joe spoke to the strength in move-in volumes that we experienced through '23. Those new customers are going to be eligible for rental rate increases, which will lead to more contribution from the volume of increases that are sent this year. Such that at the midpoint case, we're looking at contribution overall, pretty consistent with 2023 with those 2 pieces offsetting each other. In the high-end case and low-end case, a little bit better price sensitivity in the high end and a little bit worse than the low end."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Great. And then on the expense growth, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded for marketing and sort of how you're thinking about that? I guess, we were a little surprised that expense growth overall was coming in kind of at 2.75% at the midpoint. But just what do you have baked in for marketing just given the still somewhat challenging demand environment?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. So as I noted in my prepared remarks that the key drivers of expense growth are property taxes and marketing. So I will note, property tax is our largest expense line item. We do anticipate to be up 4% plus or minus, which is a contributor.And then on marketing expense, taking a step back, we increased marketing spend through the year in 2023 and saw very good returns associated with that. The fourth quarter, our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.5%. And as you've heard from me in the past, being in that 1% to 3%, 1% back in 2021 when demand was really, really strong and back towards 3% when you go to a more typical operating environment, pre-pandemic, is a comfortable place for us to be.And so the first part of 2024, we're going to be lapping comps that will lead to year-over-year growth levels that are higher, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter and then we'll evaluate as we go from there. But we're comfortable in the ZIP Code and continue to see a very strong return on that advertising dollar."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""You finished the year with 80 basis points of same-store revenue growth and your guidance for the upcoming year ranges from down 1% to up 1%. So presumably same-store revenue growth is going to dip before it kind of rebounds and that goes in line with the -- I think, some of what you've been saying with the -- with your expectations of street rates. So -- how much of -- in the midpoint of your guidance, how much of a dip are you expecting? And when are you expecting trends to kind of inflect better through the year?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Good question, Michael. So there's a couple of components to this question that I'll respond to. The first is, as we look at our operating metrics, our operating metrics are starting to improve, right? We talked about occupancy closing the gap as we move through last year, and we finished the year with occupancy down 70 basis points compared to down 240 basis points when we started '23.If you look at move-in rent trends, move-in rents on a year-over-year basis decelerated through the year. In the fourth quarter, they were down 18%. Throughout the quarter. But as we noted in our January update, they improved to down 11% in December. Looking at January and February, they're down in that same 10%, 11% sort of ZIP code. So that improvement has been lasting. And as you heard through our outlook, we anticipate that to continue to close as we move through this year.I highlight that because operating metrics tend to lead financial metrics, meaning that as we're talking about some of these operating metrics improve, it will take several quarters to see that in financial metrics. And so if you think about the shape of the curve and the description of the midpoint case that I gave earlier, it would imply that to your point, we're going to see some deceleration through the first couple of quarters of this year. But then the second derivative, the rate of change of growth is going to flip positive in that midpoint case in the second half and you're going to see some reacceleration in the financial metrics, again, lagging those operating metrics in the second half.The second component of the question that I just highlighted is, we're already seeing that in certain markets. And so if you look at the Mid-Atlantic, for instance, or Seattle, markets that maybe didn't have the high highs in 2021, but have been solid performers. We're actually seeing those accelerate as we sit here today in the first quarter and would expect those high, high markets, the Floridas, the Atlantas, for instance, to take a little bit longer to find that turn given how high their high was. But we're already seeing some of that turnaround in some of our operating metrics today."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""And my second question, it's a multiparter, but it shouldn't be too intimidating. You comment in the that softer that -- you say, you expect industry-wide demand from new customers. To stabilize this year due to improving macroeconomic conditions. So one, are you seeing that today? Two, can you kind of provide an update on where the move-in rents were in January and to the extent that you're able to provide insight into February? And then three, the -- you've talked about move-in rents crossing the zero. How positive, if that momentum has continued -- how positive could move in rents be as we kind of exit the year?"", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""Okay. Apologies accepted, but you took some liberty there, Michael, but we'll address your question. All right. So let me start with consumer strength and what we continue to see in the portfolio that's been trending to a clear advantage, even with the performance we saw quarter-by-quarter in 2023. The consumer activity, first of all, in existing customers, as I've mentioned, has been quite strong, and we're really not seeing any on the margin evidence that that's likely to change even going into what we've seen through almost 2 months of this year.Balance sheets are quite healthy. Payment patterns are still better than they were pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any undue or new stress evolving into customer activity. The acceptance of our ongoing revenue management tied to existing customer rate increases. We have a very active engagement process with existing customers that guides us to the tolerance and the level of activity that we're pushing through on ECRIs, that too has not hit different levels of either areas that we've become more concerned about. In fact, it's validating many of the things that we've already talked about relative to the performance of existing customers and our confidence that that's likely to stay with us, even coupled with what Tom just mentioned, indicating in certain markets, where you've actually seeing the -- some good percolation taking place. That ties clearly to the kind of activity from a new customer demand activity.We're having to work harder as we did all through 2023 with a variety of tools that we have. They're quite good. In fact, they continue to get much better. We are very confident market to market with our scale and the knowledge we have market to market. We have the right tools. We have the right brand. We have the right technologies to continue to pull customers to our platform, and we're going to continue to leverage those going into the next several months. With the anticipation, as Tom mentioned, that by summer or late summer, we're going to start seeing the residual effects to the positive from all those efforts.And then Tom, you can tackle if you choose to, Michael's additional questions."", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""So Michael, I'll just maybe take a step back and talk a little bit about how we thought about the macro environment in our guidance. So last year, on this call, we spent a good bit of time talking about the macro environment. And we did couch the guidance range last year in macro terms and that, we viewed it as appropriate given the landscape at the time. At the time, 65% of Bloomberg economists were expecting a recession during the calendar year, for instance, and we thought it would make sense to provide the investment community our assumptions of what that could potentially look like within our guidance range.Clearly, as we move through '23 that recession outcome became less probable. And as such, our financial performance proved out to be towards the higher end of those expectations as we move through the year.This year, we are not couching the range in terms of macro. And as you think about the midpoint of the range, we're not assuming that the macro environment needs to improve at the midpoint range, but more around the lines of what Joe was speaking to and what we're seeing today. So I hope that's helpful in terms of how we thought about the range.And then I will hit on one of your comments just again because you asked about what move-in rents were doing in January and February. I'll just reiterate that for the group. Move-in rents were down 10%, 11%. So pretty consistent with December performance, which is what you'd anticipate, right, because we're at kind of the trough of rental rates in the winter season here. And we'll be looking to March, April and May to see some acceleration in moving rents."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Maybe just piggybacking off of part of Michael's question. I guess what is assumed within the range of -- when street rates break that year-over-year breakeven point? And if you have any color around changes in -- or difference in occupancy assumptions at the high or low end of the range?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure, Juan. I'll give you some context around both the high and the low. And specifically, you're speaking to same-store revenues. So that's where I'll focus my attention. So as I noted, at the midpoint case, that assumes that we cross that 0 on a year-over-year basis for moving rents at the end of the summer and occupancy being down about 80 basis points. Pretty similar to where we finished the year in '23. And I would note that, that's -- as we sit here today, year-to-date, we're down 70, 80 basis points in occupancy, so consistent with where we sit today.In terms of the high end and the low end, the low end assumes that it takes a little bit longer for operating metrics to stabilize here. And as such, the assumption on when we cross 0 on year-over-year move-in rents is at the end of the year. And in that case, we're assuming, right, it takes a little longer to stabilize. The move-in environment is going to be a little bit tougher, Occupancy is down about 120 basis points year-over-year.At the high end, we're assuming a more vibrant spring leasing season, one, which we see a little bit of a rebound in the housing market, something we spent a good bit of time talking about through the fall of last year. There are some indications that we could experience that this year. The high end of the range assumes that. And as such, that 0 crossing point is at the beginning of the summer in that spring leasing season and occupancy, as you'd expect, results in better performance down about 20% -- or 20 basis points -- sorry, 20 basis points throughout the year with an acceleration in the summer and a higher peak seasonally."", 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""And then for my follow-up, you're assuming acquisitions in the guidance. So just curious if you could speak to the investment environment. Any color on where you're seeing stabilized cap rates and just the quality and the quantum of opportunities out in the marketplace?"", 'Joseph D. Russell', 'Yes, sure, Juan. I\'ll take that. I would say, at this point, we\'re continuing to see the same environment that we saw through most of 2023. So a lot of owners are reluctant to put properties into the market. Knowing that they\'re going to potentially not achieve the cap rate or the valuation that they expected based on prior year inflated valuations, et cetera, when interest rates were at a much different price point. So the reluctance continues. The amount of activity going into the first part of this year, which is typically very light, is just that. We are getting a number of inbound discussions that are tied to properties that are ""not on the market"" to either test the water or judge whether or not we are ready to transact at a valuation that either meets or would be acceptable for that particular seller.We do not have anything as noted in our release, currently under contract. The team is busy. We\'re engaged in a number of different conversations with a variety of different size opportunities, whether single assets or larger portfolios. But as we saw in 2023, the beginning of 2024 is likely to be very similar. And we\'ll see going into the next few months, if there\'s either some pent-up demand or additional realization that cap rates have adjusted, and we\'ll just see if, in fact, there\'s going to be more trading.Clearly, one thing that could moderate that to some degree in push activity to a higher level is some activity by the Fed reducing interest rates, potentially with some impact on cap rate adjustments, et cetera. But frankly, there\'s just not a lot of trading going on right now to give you any really clear sense of how directly cap rates have changed at the moment. But the gap continues, meaning the level of seller expectations to what we feel are prudent ways for us to allocate capital. Many of the conversations just start with that, and we\'ll see how that plays out here in the near term.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""Great. Just trying to think about all the comments, upper end, the lower end assumptions, skepticism, we continue to hear. Just some of the concerns. I mean, I guess to be clear, are you saying from the data you're seeing year-to-date that you finally feel there is more or greater visibility on how to forecast this year versus, let's say, last year?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes, Jeff, I think as we sit here today, we do have more visibility, we think, heading into this year. I mean, I just spoke earlier around how we couched the ranges last year in the macroeconomic environment, our view is the macroeconomic environment is clearer this year. We're not couching the ranges that way.And as we sit here today, right, is very different than last year. Last year, we knew that demand was weaker, and we were going to see revenue growth decelerate through the year in a pretty meaningful way. This year, that pace of deceleration has really slowed. And as I highlighted earlier, there's actually some markets in our portfolio that are reaccelerating already in the first quarter, which we view as leading as we move through the year. And so from a range of variability less than last year. Now that's not to diminish the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment. We're still talking about moving rents being down 10%, 11% to start the year. That's not like a typical prepandemic year, where we'd be debating our move-in rent is going to be up 3% or are they going to be up 5% in a very tight band. That's not the environment we've been operating through in the last several years.And as such, we think we've couched the ranges appropriately to encapsulate that variability. But we do feel more confident in the range of outcomes this year than we did last year."", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""And like many times, Jeff, it's never one single issue, but Tom just went through a number of the things that have given us more clarity and perspective going into this year that we think are, a, additive one by one. Another factor that's continuing to trend very favorably to the entire industry that we're seeing, particularly in nearly every market we operate in our reduced levels of deliveries. The development business has continued to be very, very difficult. Funding for new construction is either at a very high cost or from an availability standpoint, very limited. The time to get through entitlements, even for our own processes are continuing to be very difficult.So this too creates another additive element that we have even more perspective on now that we've been through a multiyear deceleration of new development deliveries, putting us in a very different position even year-by-year that we've had more confidence to say this is a different environment, very different than where we were even a year ago.So with that, we think that we've got the right perspective, continue to read the variety of tea leaves out there, but we are very confident that we've got the right tools to guide us and put the kind of perspective that we've got into our outlook for 2024."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""Great. And then my follow-up is, can you discuss trends you're seeing in January and February, including move-in, move-outs and maybe which markets are doing better or worse? Let's say, year-to-date?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure, Jeff. I mean I think I've already covered the move-in rate component and as well as the occupancy side. So maybe I'll just focus on the market part of the question, which is not too dissimilar to fourth quarter performance. We continue to see strength in Southern California, for instance. As our strongest area of growth. And as we spoke about through '23, the markets that had the highest highs in '21 and '22 are giving back some of that appropriately so. And so the weaker markets on a growth rate basis to start the year are some of those southeastern markets, Florida, Atlanta, et cetera."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.', 'Keegan Grant Carl', ""Maybe first, just where is your development line -- your development pipelines start for the year? And where are you expecting to end based on your anticipated deliveries in '24?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes, Keegan, maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the development environment and then some of the sequencing of our deliveries. So as we've sat here today, we've been trying to grow our development business from where we were delivering more like $100 million to $200 million in deliveries in '21 and '22. Last year, we delivered $360 million, as I noted in my remarks, We're looking to deliver $450 million in this year. So an acceleration when the industry overall is seeing delivery slowdown.So we're taking some share there in growing that business. We're doing so because we think it's the highest risk-adjusted return on capital. And you can see the returns that we've achieved on our development vintages in the sub. And we have an in-house team that's dedicated to this program, development, construction, design that are all out working on growing that pipeline.This will be a record year. The team is out of figuring out how we're going to backfill that development pipeline from here in a challenging development environment. But as we sit here today, that's a business we want to grow. And we'll be looking to backfill that pipeline and have deliveries next year, hopefully around the same levels that we have this year and go from there."", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""And yes, just from a timing standpoint, Keegan, a little lighter in Q1 but then pretty balanced deliveries in the subsequent 3 quarters, a little bit differently than what we saw in 2023, where we had a lot of deliveries hit more towards the second half of the year. So we've got a good combination of both ground up new development, and we're a little overweighted on expansion and redevelopment opportunities, particularly tied to unusually large projects that we'll complete in 2024.So -- as Tom mentioned, the team is working hard not only to continue to grow the overall pipeline, but to continue to put these generation 5 Class A properties into a whole variety of markets. And we're continuing to see very good lease-up and again, returns tied to the development activity, both new development and redevelopment."", 'Keegan Grant Carl', ""Got it. That's really helpful. And then shifting gears here, I know Tom mentioned a little bit about SoCal demand. I'm just curious, have you seen a material change for storage demand in L.A. on the back of the flooding? And then can you just remind us of what the typical tailwind of a natural disaster is fair demand in a given market?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. So I wouldn't call the rains that we've had in the winter here in Southern California a natural disaster. It has been raining this week, frankly. So we don't see a surge in demand. In fact, what we tend to see is Southern California residents and drivers tend to stay off the roads and you don't see as much move-in activity or move-out activity, for instance, in periods of time when it's raining here in SoCal. But overall, I'd say demand remains healthy here. Occupancies are very healthy in L.A., San Diego, Orange County. So we feel very good about how the portfolio is set up, and we'll work through the rains here in SoCal. Sun shined today so we had a busier day today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors.', 'Spenser Bowes Allaway', ""Maybe just a more pointed question on the transaction market. And I know it's a small sample set here, but the 11 assets you closed in the fourth quarter. Can you share the going in yield and then where you expect that to stabilize?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. Getting into specifics, I'd say -- the -- there's a range of going in yields depending on how stabilized the assets are. So of those 11 assets, some of them were CofO properties where the going-in yield is 0 or a little bit negative. And then you had some that were more stabilized that going in yields are probably mid 5% to 6%, and we're going to seek to improve the operations on those portfolios and get them to those assets rather, and get them to 6% plus as we think about the return profile of those assets.And that's pretty consistent with what we saw through most of 2023. As Joe mentioned, we'll see how the interest rate and capital environment plays through into '24, but that hopefully gives you a guidepost on yields."", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""And Spenser, from a strategy and appetite standpoint, we continue to look for properties that are potentially either lease-up opportunities or stabilization opportunities by putting those assets on our own platform.So not shy at all about taking on lease-up risk. In fact, many times we see an actual pretty sharp improvement once we put those assets onto our own platform. And we're confident that again, those strategies will play well even going into this year. And continue to look for a whole range of different type of assets even based on age and maturity of the tenant base, et cetera.But clearly, no differentiation relative to the strategy we've deployed over the last few years looking for opportunities when properties are far from stabilized. And again, buying the properties at the right price point, location, et cetera, continues to be very advantageous for us."", 'Spenser Bowes Allaway', 'Okay. Great. And to that point, in regards to the Simply portfolio. Can you provide an update on where the rent and occupancy stands today for those properties relative to the same-store pool?', 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. So the rents of that portfolio have been improving as they've been added into our portfolio. So we've already seen some of the benefits of adding that portfolio in. The occupancy, as it sits there, I think it's in the mid-80s, today, seasonally, I think when we took it over in the peak of the summer, it was towards the upper 80s. We'll obviously look to lease that back up into the spring leasing season and take the occupancy of there ultimately into the '90s on stabilization.So seeing good trends as we've added that portfolio and those 90,000 customers into our portfolio and on track for a good spring leasing season with that portfolio with properties orange painted and Public Storage signage, which the customers are reacting well to."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Anthony Peak', ""This is A.J. on for Todd. I appreciate you guys taking the time. Just -- first one, as you've noted, you made good progress on narrowing the occupancy gap year-over-year over the past few quarters. I guess, why would you not expect to call back more occupancy throughout the year, given the easier comps and the broader stabilization that you're anticipating in your base case around move-in rent and demand?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. I think part of what you're seeing in that midpoint case is if you take a step back, right, we had really strong demands in occupancies in '21, '22. And as those tenants cycled through and we experienced weaker demand through '23. We're seeking to maximize revenue ultimately in a trade-off between rents and occupancies. And that's managed at a very granular level, at the unit level across our properties based on the demand we're seeing, the customer price sensitivity, et cetera.And so that balance is real at the granular level. And what you see at the output is it made sense to give up in effect some of that 2021 heightened level of occupancy to maximize revenues. And as we sit here today, our occupancies are down about 70, 80 basis points compared to where we started in 2023. Again, that midpoint case doesn't assume that there's a big uplift in seasonal demand. And so you're kind of -- you're not getting a big lift there similar to how we experienced last year. And so as we move through the year, you may see some closing towards the end of the year, but you're going to probably be finished on average through the year about the same as where we're sitting today."", 'Anthony Peak', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the seasonality, you had softer seasonality last year. What's embedded in the guidance for 2024? And I guess, really looking at historical data. When do you expect to start seeing the pickup in rental demand for the peak rental season?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. So I'll couch seasonality in terms of the peak-to-trough change in occupancy. So last year, we experienced -- taking a step back even further in 2015 to 2019, there was typically about a 280 basis point peak-to-trough change in occupancy, call that from June 30 to December 31. In 2022, we experienced about a 240 basis points. So it was a little bit less seasonal than a typical year. In 2023, that fell all the way down to about 160 basis points peak-to-trough. And in 2024, our midpoint case is a touch over 200. So a little bit more seasonality, but not as much as we experienced in '22 and a far cry from what we experienced in the pre-pandemic time period."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi.', 'Eric Wolfe', ""You talked about the move-in rents crossing over into positive territory in late summer. Just curious where move-in rents will be at that time. So what's the annual contract rate that you expect to see in late summer? And how much of that improvement from current levels is just driven by seasonality versus a strengthening of your business?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Thanks, Eric. So I think we'll have to dig up and we can get to you exactly. I don't have in front of me what our third quarter move-in rents were, for instance. But at end of summer, we're expecting it to cross 0. So I'd look at plus or minus our third quarter of '23 move-in rents. And I think the team is going to dig up third quarter contract rents, so you can have them.In terms of what we need to see to get there, there's seasonality every year. So as the question earlier, so even in a year last year where I'd call it an atypical year where we didn't see a lot of seasonal strength through your April, May and June. The housing market has been very well publicized as resetting lower in terms of transaction volumes as being a driver there.As we think about move-in rents they're going to rise and they rose last year, they're going to rise on an absolute basis into the summer. And then what you're going to see is a little bit more growth in rental rates this year to close that gap over the time between now and the end of the year last year, or the end of the summer, this upcoming year. Does that make sense?"", 'Eric Wolfe', ""Yes. No, that makes sense. And I guess the question then really is, just -- you talked about that extra gap that it needs to sort of close to get them above and beyond seasonality. Can you just put that in context? Like is that a is that extra gap that it needs to close pretty large relative to history? Is it somewhat normal relative to other recovery period? Just trying to understand sort of whether it's unusual relative to what you've seen in the past?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. I guess the way I'd characterize it is we saw less than what we would typically see last year in terms of a seasonal uplift in rents. And what we're saying is we're expecting stabilization in demand through this year, which means that we shouldn't continue to set new lows seasonally adjusted on move-in rents in the midpoint case. And so that's going to result in closing of that gap. We're not suggesting that the environment needs to get significantly better, but rather stabilize as we move through this year and not set fresh lows. And to follow up on your question, the team dug it up. We had move-in rents on a contract basis in the third quarter about $16."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.', 'Ki Bin Kim', 'A quick question on ECRIs. As you look ahead, are you projecting to be a bit more aggressive in terms of magnitude or frequency with your ECRI program compared to 2023?', 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""So, Ki Bin, we spoke about this a little earlier. There's a little bit of a give and take this year. We're expecting that on the one side, the consumer remains strong, as Joe highlighted in his remarks, and that we don't see a significant shift in customer price sensitivity, which we've been very encouraged in experiencing through '22 and '23. So that's one side.On the other side, on replacement costs, move-in rents are still down 10%, 11%. So replacement cost is higher at the start of this year than it was at the start of last year on average. And so that's going to have a detriment to overall contribution.But the flip side of that, that I highlighted earlier was the fact that we moved in a lot more new customers. Last year, move-in rents were strong, up about 9%, and that will have a positive impact on the -- not the magnitude, but the number of increases that we send throughout the year. And those things largely will offset such that the contribution of ECRIs as we sit here today in the midpoint case is pretty consistent year-over-year."", 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Okay. And I'm not sure how you internally gauged us, but can you provide any color on changes that you noticed on your customer conversion rate or your market share win of customers?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. So Joe spoke to a lot of the tools that we were using through last year. Advertising, promotions, rental rates and the power of advertising platform online. So we saw better than industry top-of-funnel demand into our system, which ultimately led to good move-ins. But we also saw stronger conversion associated with both pricing and promotion, which are more conversion-related items such that conversion rates both through -- well, through all the channels that we operate in, both website, call center and folks walking in are higher in '23 compared to '22, and we're seeing good trends into '24 as well."", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""And on top of that, Ki Bin, as we've talked about, our digital platform continues to give customers the ability to again transact with us through not only digital platform, but now even through our care center, et cetera. So we're making that conversion activity even that much more effective relative to -- again, consumer intent with all the tools that we have to get them to top-of-funnel activity, but then actually to the conversion itself from a speed, efficiency, time of day.Frankly, many of our customers transact with us and off business hours now. So all very good tools that continue to lead to a very strong conversion that, to Tom's point, we feel like we've got good industry-leading capabilities that we're going to continue to invest and optimize going forward."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from [Hong Hang] with JPMorgan.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""I guess, first off, you (inaudible) fair homes better and [SoCal] definitely fell a little bit more of Northern California. But I guess my first question is just, is it safe to think about the low end of the range, that's basically there being no return, no seasonal demand? Or are you expecting higher seasonal demand community than last year, even at the low end?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""We're assuming less seasonal demand in the low end I agree with that. I think that's something I mentioned earlier. So I agree with that and more seasonal demand in the high end."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Okay. And then I guess, my second question. You've grown your management platform pretty well. Have you had any success in sourcing acquisitions from there yet? And how big of a potential source of acquisitions do you think that could represent in the future?"", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""Yes. That's key component of the growth of the platform itself. It's a very relationship-oriented business. Thus far, we've acquired close to 40 assets out of the program. Over the last few quarters, it's been on the light side. Again, it's, I think, indicative of the environment that we've been seeing in acquisitions in general with many owners not of a mindset that this is the right time necessarily to do a transaction or a trade. But with the growing platform itself.Again, we saw very good traction in 2023. We've got good momentum going into this year as well. Those additive relationships, knowledge of the assets, their comfort level with our own ability to transact very efficiently. We'll continue to be a good source of not only relationships but acquisition activity over time. So I noted that now the program is at about 325 assets. And we still see good momentum to continue to grow to our ultimate goal and optimization of the platform. So we'll likely see that in the next year to two. And with that more acquisition opportunities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.', 'Eric Thomas Luebchow', 'you could talk a little bit about the spread between move-in and move-out rents. I assume that gap should start to narrow by midyear just based on the move-in rent improvement you talked about. But should we expect any change in the average rents of customers moving out based on average length of stay or any other variables that we should consider there?', 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Eric, it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on that. We're sitting here in the winter, Q4 and Q1 you're going to have that differential between the move-ins and move-outs to be higher. That's going to then narrow as we move into Q2 and Q3 and then rewiden again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the comments that I made around move-in rents getting to a point where they're not declining on a year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter will be helpful on that, but you're still probably going to end in a similar territory on gap there between move-in and move-outs in the midpoint case. And we're very comfortable with that. And managing to achieve those higher revenues from our in-place customers who are placing a lot of value on our space."", 'Eric Thomas Luebchow', ""And just my follow-up, you touched on this several times, but the newer customers you've loaded at much lower move-in rates the past year. You talked about increasing the frequency and the magnitude of rate increases for that cohort. So have you seen those large rate increases kind of perform within expectations as you've started to push those through kind of toward the end of '23 and early 2024 in terms of either retention or customer receptivity?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes, I'd say to reiterate something that Joe mentioned earlier, which is that the customers continue to behave as expected and with some strength, and we continue to see good momentum within that program, and that includes both newer customer as well as longer-term customers in the program."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""The first is just on the same-store revenue guidance of flat. I guess I'm trying to tie your comments about a first half and second half dynamic where the first half maybe is a little bit slower and you have a pickup in the second half. So should we be bracing for sort of negative same-store as you start the year before you end the year somewhere sort of well above 0 to get to the midpoint of the guidance."", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I hope that everyone is not embracing. But I would anticipate that we see deceleration through the first part of the year. And yes, that likely involves a negative performance. on a year-over-year basis through the first half. And then yes, reacceleration as those -- the lag between operating metric improvement and financial metric performance starts to show in the second half of the year."", 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Great. And then, look, my second question is just, I guess, we're trying to figure out how aggressive or conservative the guidance is because on the one hand, you talked about last year, there were a lot more macro concerns. So maybe that was a reason to be a little bit more conservative versus this year. But you also sort of mentioned that the move in volumes at 9% was basically 2x what you did in sort of 2022, which should presumably set up well for pricing power.So maybe could you -- when you're putting all that together, maybe, can you talk about how much conservatism or not is built into the guidance this year and how we think about that?"", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Sure. So I guess the way I'd couch it is we did cover a macro series of scenarios for our guidance ranges last year. The range on same-store revenue was about 250 basis points. This year, as we sit here, there's still uncertainty as I highlighted, maybe a little bit less than what we experienced last year -- what we were expecting last year. And so the range is 200 basis points this year, so not too far different. Our core FFO range was about $0.70 last year. I think the range this year is $0.60. So we're still talking about similar levels of range. And as a reminder, we operate a month-to-month lease business. And so there is some variability that could play out through the year. I've tried to be very transparent on what the range of potential outcomes are in a number of the key metrics, both at the high and the low end.And we'll look on to executing through our plan this year, and I'll leave judging, conservatism or aggressiveness to the investment community, but we want to try to be transparent around what our assumptions are and how we plan on navigating through the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', 'Just one quick follow-up, Tom. It sounds like your contractual rent for move-ins will still be negative in the first half of the year. I think you said it was running down about 11% in the first quarter. I think you said you expect it to get to about a breakeven in the third quarter. I guess, what is the overall expectation for the year? I mean I presume fourth quarter might be up fourth quarter over fourth quarter, but that still leaves you kind of negative for the year? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?', 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. That's the right way to think about it, Steve. The midpoint case, I think move-in rents are down 3% on average through the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""Just one quick follow-up for me. I think from our conversations with investors, I think they were expecting same-store revenue growth at kind of like the low end of your same-store revenue guidance. So, what do you need to see or believe about the consumer or the length of stay to get ECRIs to drive kind of that same-store revenue growth at that low end of the guidance, all else being equal? And I know it's kind of like there's a lot of moving parts there. But just what would need to get the ECRI to the low end of the same-store revenue guidance?"", 'Joseph D. Russell', 'Well, I would...', 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Subject to ECRIs, right? I mean we gave you a lot of different metrics at the low end that gets you there. I gave you the perspective that demand -- new customer demand in that lower end case doesn't stabilize until later in the year and you don't cross year-over-year move-in rents until the fourth quarter, really towards the end of the year.ECRIs, we're assuming in that case that there's a little bit more price sensitivity than what we're experiencing right now. To directly answer your question, move-out churn. We're anticipating really in is centered around in the midpoint case, the same levels of churn we saw last year, which is very consistent with what we saw in 2019. Churn levels are up a little bit in that low-end case, but not materially. So that's what gets you at the low end."", 'Joseph D. Russell', ""And then again, Michael, as we've been speaking to, we're seeing, again, continued validation of, I would say, healthy economy, very consumer-oriented economy where the pressure points of a year ago or beyond relative to whether it was inflation, interest rates, employment, et cetera, are at a better place today with more clarity today than they were certainly at the beginning of 2023. That continues to play through relative to our own month-by-month operating metrics that we're seeing going even into 2024. So something would have to shift pretty materially away from that to give us a different low-end view as well."", 'H. Thomas Boyle', ""Yes. And we'll obviously update you on that as we go through the year. I'd maybe reiterate something I said in my prepared remarks, that I would focus more on move-in rents. That has been the big area of variability over the last year or two on same-store revenue performance. Try to give the investment community some guideposts in terms of how we think about that going through the year. But we operate a month-to-month lease business where we're going to be adding about 6% to 8% of our tenant base every month. And the rate with which we add those customers is going to be very impactful on where we end up through this range. And we'll update you on what we're seeing on operating trends as we move through the year."", 'Operator', ""We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments."", 'Ryan C. Burke', ""Thanks, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We'll talk to you soon.

Or you could buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway."", ""Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company, and it has a different mandate than the typical individual investor. Its positions won't always be the best moves for you. However, it's still a great place to get investing inspiration. If you have $300 to invest after saving for an emergency and paying off debt, you might want to consider some of Buffett's picks. Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and American Express (NYSE: AXP) are three great choices."", ""Nu is an all-digital bank based in Brazil but also serving Mexico and Colombia. It consistently reports incredible growth, with higher revenue, new customers, and increasing profit. It added 5.4 million customers in the 2023 third quarter to reach a total of 89.1 million. It now has more than half of the adult population in Brazil as customers, becoming the fifth-largest bank by customer count. It's making inroads in its other markets, where it still has a small fraction of the opportunity."", ""Its strategy revolves around hooking customers into a product with low fees and its easy-to-use consumer experience and then upselling and cross-selling more and higher-priced products. This is leading to incredible growth with strong cost efficiency and higher profit. In the 2023 third quarter, revenue increased 53% year over year, and net income rose from $7.8 million last year to $303 million this year. Average revenue per user continues to increase, from $7.80 last year to $10 in this year's third quarter. Deposits increased 26% from last year while funding costs remained stable, and net interest income and margin expanded to record rates."", ""These aren't unusual results for Nu, and it has expanded its opportunities with its new markets. Nu is an atypical Buffett stock, and it's an excellent growth stock to buy right now."", ""Amazon has been an incredible stock to own over its lifetime, but it has plenty of gas left in its tank. It's on to the next phase of its incredible journey, and artificial intelligence (AI) is leading the way."", 'It recently released an impressive array of generative AI tools for Amazon Web Services (AWS) that make it easy and quick to create codes, marketing campaigns, and more. It has several levels of AI solutions to address varying needs, from customizable developer tools to small business tools like product descriptions based on images.', ""If it appears to have maxed out on e-commerce, consider that it's made some important structural changes to the e-commerce business that are making it more efficient, getting more deliveries to shoppers faster and at cheaper costs to Amazon. The faster orders get to their destinations, the more likely customers will continue to make Amazon their preferred e-commerce provider."", 'Amazon ended 2023 on a high note, with a 14% year-over-year sales increase in the fourth quarter and $10.6 billion in net income, up from $0.3 billion last year. Investors can expect more from Amazon in 2024 and beyond.', 'American Express hasn\'t changed its model recently, but it has made some crucial adjustments and investments that have turned it into a real financial powerhouse. One major shift is its target market, which used to be affluent business people. It has successfully pivoted to capture a younger, still affluent market that\'s driving growth now and should continue to do so for years. It\'s done some recent card ""refreshes"" to appeal to a new demographic and keep up its reputation for the best credit card perks. It has also expanded its services, offering bank accounts and a full suite of small business solutions.', ""This brings it into a new, digital age and allows it to compete with younger fintechs. However, it's still the same American Express, with a fee-based card model and focus on travel and entertainment. Fee income increased 20% from last year in the fourth quarter, and travel and entertainment spending increased 19% year over year vs. 6% for goods and services, getting back to pre-pandemic trends. The combination has made it stronger than ever, resilient, and filled with future opportunity."", 'Management is forecasting a 20% rise in revenue this year, with long-term goals of more than that. It expects earnings per share to increase in the mid-teen percentages for the full year, with similar long-term aspirations.', ""American Express also pays a growing dividend.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd."", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be with you this morning to share outstanding financial results and to discuss the advancement of key business initiatives, which our devoted and talented workforce delivered to support our customers, communities and our shareholders across all of 2023. We began the year with a premium business plan represented by the value proposition you see on Slide 3. The bottom line is the NiSource team delivered. You'll notice successful execution of these key initiatives across the board. Let me provide a few highlights, which fuel our resilient and sustaining business across all years of our plan. we executed our highest CapEx investment in 2023, exceeding our rate base investment goals. As of the year-end 2023, we had $18.8 billion of rate base, we continue to forecast $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 and $16 billion over our 5-year financial plan through 2028. Year-over-year, NOEPS growth achieved 9% increase and achieved the highest end of our guidance range. We are acutely focused on smart capital deployment and maximizing risk-adjusted returns and responsible rate-based investing through strong recovery mechanisms across our businesses. Project Apollo achieved this goal of over $50 million of cost savings initiatives. Perhaps more important than the amount of savings is the energy and support demonstrated our people to build a continuous improvement mindset and enhance productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less calls. These initiatives contributed greatly to a total shareholder return, which exceeded mid-cap and large-cap U.S. utility peers in 2023. For the 3-year period, total shareholder return was 10.1% compound annual growth rate versus 5% for peers, which is reflective of our strong earnings per share execution and future growth prospects. We are confident our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last 2 years and which our financial results have delivered over this period. We continue building a track record of growth and execution and our commitment to investors, customers and employees is central to everything we do. On Slide 4, you'll see our key priorities. First, as you observed in our release, we delivered 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS of $1.60 versus the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60 revised guidance range. This underscores our execution of resilient financial commitments and a business plan, which anticipated the broader headwinds our customers and our sector are facing today. This result was achieved despite a $128 million increase in interest expense and without sacrificing our FFO to debt commitment. Built on the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, we are raising 2024 guidance to $1.70 to $1.74 from $1.68 to $1.72, which we initiated in November. We continue to expect a 2023 through 2028 annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% supported by 8% to 10% annual rate base growth. The 2024 guidance range is refreshed reflective of the annual growth expected of our strong year-end 2023 financial results; second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers. NIPSCO received IURC approval of renewable CPCN amendments for several of our investments in January. Intervenor testimony was also received last month for our NIPSCO gas rate case filed in October 2023. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for shareholders. A key focus for 2023 was the NIPSCO minority interest transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, which successfully closed in December. This transaction diversified capital fundraising for NiSource from public capital markets and create a long-term partnership for years to come. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulation, decarbonization and modernization. Slide 5 details our annual capital expenditures across our 6-state service territory. Our $16 billion 5-year plan was introduced in November 2023 built on and extended our prior November 2022, $15 billion plan. It incorporates the electric generation, transmission, gas modernization and economic development investments through 2028. The nature of our capital plan diversifies project risks, including our generation project investments, which lack the large project execution risk on the scale seen elsewhere in the industry in recent years. We intend to layer in projects from our $2 billion upside capital program as they meet our threshold for base plan execution. Key rate case and capital rider activity is shown on Slide 6. Our leading regulatory and stakeholder execution advances as we continue to work with stakeholders through rate case and tracker cycles to efficiently deploy capital investments and recover costs associated with these investments to drive value for customers, our communities and our shareholders. The strength of our company continues to be working constructively with stakeholders and communities to safely and reliably deliver the energy they deserve and to be there for our customers when they need energy most. Since our last update, our Virginia SAVE rider was approved and implemented and our Kentucky SMRP rider went into effect, subject to refund, together covering over $100 million of capital investment made for our customers. Slide 7 shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated in decision-making in all areas of the company. Last year, we significantly improved safety performance by delivering a 14% reduction in days away restricted or transferred or DART and are on a path to achieving a goal of top [decile] performance. Additionally, we recorded a 16% reduction to preventable vehicle collisions or PVCs. As I already mentioned, Project Apollo is generating enhanced productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less costs. The improvements in our work plans and cost profiles are expected to continue and sustain this year after an implementation that exceeded expectations in 2023. I have provided you with specific examples of project initiatives in recent quarters, but I want to highlight the underlying cultural change occurring throughout the company. The team continues to find new ways to improve every day, and this will generate value for all our stakeholders for decades. I am impressed with the continuous improved mindset fueling our organization, and I am excited for our team as we continue this journey. Before we advance the call, I want to close this section with the following. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team and their each and every day to support our nearly 4 million customers. With extreme cold weather across much of January, we delivered critical energy to keep our customers safe and warm. 2023 was a banner year for NiSource as the first full year of execution across our strategy shared in November 2022, and we deliver on all [markets] across the board. This sets the foundation for continued growth and safety and reliability for our customers and value for our shareholders, which we strongly believe in. Michael and Shawn will dive into greater details on why 2023 was a successful year for our stakeholders and also why 2024 and beyond will be even better. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."", 'Michael Luhrs', ""Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide 8. NIPSCO's generation transition remains on track. I will support the retirement of 2 of the remaining 3 coal-fired generation units by the end of 2025 and the final unit by 2028. To this end, construction on our Crossroads II Wind PPA was completed at the end of 2023, and the facility is now producing sustainable 0 fuel cost generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers. In fact, customers are seeing the benefit of this generation as part of our renewable portfolio already, receiving $18 million in renewable energy credit sold into the marketplace in 2023 lowering customers' overall cost of energy. In November of 2023, NIPSCO received approval on a CPCN amendment converting Gibson from a PPA to a build transfer agreement. Also, progress continues on Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II solar facilities, and we expect both to be completed as planned later this year. In January, NIPSCO received approval from the IURC to own 100% of these 2 projects in lieu of owning them through tax equity joint ventures. Fully owning these projects will benefit customers. By leveraging the tax credit transferability provisions of the IRA, NIPSCO will be able to monetize tax credits associated with the projects more efficiently than under tax equity agreements resulting in comparatively lower energy costs for customers. We continue to evaluate the customer benefits of utilizing similar approaches for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects, which are in development. So we have made significant advancements in our generation portfolio. We are looking forward to how we advance the portfolio and reliability, resiliency, customer benefits and towards our goal of net 0 by 2040. An important component of our generation portfolio planning process is NIPSCO's triennial Integrated Resource Plan or IRP. The 2024 IRP will evaluate NIPSCO's long-term generating capacity requirements and informed generation investment decisions beyond NIPSCO's gas peaker project and the renewable projects already in development. The 2024 IRP will incorporate a number of scenarios and updates since the 2021 IRP, such as MISO's seasonal construct and its proposed resource accreditation approach. The customer-centric process will include a series of stakeholder meetings that will kick off in the spring and will culminate with the submissions of an integrated resource plan to the IURC in November. We look forward to working together with stakeholders to continue on our path to reliably serve and strengthen our communities. The IRP will build on our current generation portfolio. Our build transfer agreements and PPA projects in development as outlined on Slide 8 and our 400-megawatt gas peaker project expected in service in 2027. As a reminder, the base capital plan released in November includes the gas peaker, full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects and tax equity joint ventures for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects. On Slide 9, you'll see additional investment opportunities not included in our current base 5-year capital plan. We continue to develop and grow in a disciplined and measured way a portfolio of opportunities that benefit customers and stakeholders. We continue to advance these opportunities and will layer them into the upside CapEx plan as appropriate. Relative to gas system investments, the PHMSA rule-making process is now expected to take longer than originally anticipated. However, we still expect regulatory clarity in 2024. We do not believe the final rule will materially shift CapEx within our base plan. We will continue to evaluate how the rules apply to our systems and engage with stakeholders to deliver the system reliability and benefits expected under the rules. This engagement will inform how the implementation of rules may shape timing of investments and our upside CapEx plan.I would like to conclude my comments today with an update on our ESG performance. In addition to being on track to achieve our net 0 and interim decarbonization goals. We achieved 19% diverse supplier spend in 2023, up from 16% in 2022 and 10% in 2021. And are well on our way to our goal of achieving 25% diversifier spend by 2025. I'll now turn the call over to Shawn."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our 2023 financial results on Slide 10. Non-GAAP net operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $239 million or $0.53 per diluted share up from $221 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the same period in 2022. This earnings increase is driven by regulatory mechanisms, recovering capital investment, partly offset by a modest increase in non-tracked O&M and higher interest expense. For the full year, we reported $716 million of non-GAAP net operating earnings or $1.60 per diluted share, up from $648 million and $1.47 in 2022, respectively. Across this period, regulated revenue returns were partly offset by higher depreciation expense, interest expense and lower other income. On Slide 11, you'll find segment detail and key drivers of our results. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income increased across each of the gas, electric and corporate segments, accounting for a $209 million increase to consolidated net operating earnings. Capital expenditures, fuel regulated returns, and as Lloyd highlighted earlier, we deployed approximately $3.6 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance safety and reliability of our energy systems. This drove an increase of $335 million through regulatory activity in rate cases and capital trackers across our jurisdictions, a growing customer base across our businesses also provided a lift in our 2023 financial results and supports customer affordability. Demand for our fuel continues to be very strong with residential customer count growing over 80 basis points in our gas businesses and over 50 basis points in our electric business last year, both of which enhance the scale of NiSource. Economic development continues to thrive in the Midwest. And there is no better example of how this collaboration can benefit customers, communities and investors in Ohio. Our operations in the state serve 1.5 million customers nearly 550,000 of which are supported by our Columbus operations center. Public-private partnership has propelled Ohio's recent economic development success. In 2023 alone, 33 projects were brought to Central Ohio with over $10 billion in investment being committed. This momentum continues today as there are nearly 100 active opportunities being pursued for future development with the potential to create thousands of new jobs and invest billions of dollars more into central Ohio communities. The majority of these projects are focused in manufacturing industries, representing a diverse range of sectors, including electric vehicles, energy storage, logistics, life sciences, semiconductors, advanced computing facilities and many more. Additionally, Ohio will continue to see new corporate investment driven by downstream supplier activity for mega projects currently under construction, such as a joint venture with Honda and LG Energy and the Intel chip manufacturing facility. This development can enhance value for NiSource and create an upside to our plan from residential housing demand, which grows as these secondary businesses develop. Central Ohio's metro population grew an average of 1.8% annually over the last 30 years, and the population is expected to grow an additional 30% by 2050 boosted by strong economic development prospects. Broad stakeholder and policy support is critical to onshoring and manufacturing success and will fuel healthy and growing Midwest economies. Our communities benefit from numerous constructive regulatory mechanisms that encourage energy infrastructure investment across our states, including economic development programs to spur investments in our region, which create jobs and enhance local tax base. Switching to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight several key value drivers, which represent the foundation of our long-term financial commitments. We have increased our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance range for 2024 by $0.02 at the midpoint compared to the range introduced in November. This midpoint now represents a 7.5% year-over-year growth rate from 2023 actual results. The revised guidance is driven primarily by revenues from regulatory activity and enhanced customer demand and lower financing costs relative to our prior year forecast. These growth drivers, along with the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, underpin our expectation to continue to deliver annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% and annual rate base growth of 8% to 10% over the 2023 to 2028 period. This is driven by $16 billion of capital expenditures, and it is expected to approximate residential customer build growth to below 4% on average across the plan horizon. Finally in consistent with our last update, our base capital plan includes full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II Solar projects expected in service in 2024. Fairbanks and Gibson continue to be expected in service in 2025, using a tax equity financing structure. Our upside plan includes incremental CapEx associated with full ownership of these projects as well as electric and gas investments, which Michael detailed earlier. Our financing plan is outlined on Slide 14, which remains unchanged from our mid-November update. As we outlined in that update, we continue to expect to issue up to $600 million in ATM equity in 2024 and $200 million to $300 million of maintenance ATM equity annually in the 2025 to 2028 period to support our base capital plan. Within the operation of our at-the-market program, we retain the flexibility to include small bilateral discrete transactions should they be efficient to execute. We also continue to reaffirm our commitment to an FFO to debt ratio of 14% to 16% through 2028. In January, our Board of Directors authorized a 6% increase to our dividend, which is consistent with the annual increase authorized last year. This projects our annual dividend at the bottom half of our stated range for targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation in the high cost of capital environment. The final 2 slides will conclude our presentation and focus on execution of our stakeholder commitments. First, our multiyear track record of execution and growth continued in 2023. Lloyd touched on the premium business plan we shared with each of you in November of 2022, and this represents the full year of execution of this plan. We continue to prioritize safety while optimizing our long-term cost profile. We built on our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation through the execution of 4 general rate cases and numerous CPCN amendments and capital tracker approvals. During the year, we invested over $3.6 billion to support our customers and keep our communities and our employees safe all while enhancing the balance sheet afforded through the minority interest sale. We are proud of the execution delivered by the entire NiSource team, including achieving a 9% year-over-year growth rate and landing at the high end of our guidance range. All of these investments and the long-term visibility of our results fuel our confidence to execute each and every year as we move forward. As we share on Slide 16, each of the last 3 years, we've executed strong financial growth, achieving the upper half of our guidance range in each year. This is important. Each year we've done this, we've rebased future NOEPS guidance upwards off those actual results. We've accomplished this in 2021, 2022 and now 2023 and we expect to keep doing this as we move forward, exemplified by our upgraded guidance range with an implied midpoint of 7.5% over 2023's already strong results. And this is differentiated in our sector, which has delivered an average 5% non-GAAP NOEPS CAGR since 2021 compared to the 8% achieved by NiSource.The underlying business plan, supported by strong regulatory construct in NiSource's jurisdictions, coupled with responsible investments in identifiable regulatory programs, enable a reasonable return of investment over our plan. The confidence in these investments enables the rebasing of annual growth rate, which supports this higher NOEPS range as we execute the plan, which, in turn, enhances the future earnings potential of our business in each forward year of our plan. We are excited about the future prospects of our business and to continue building a track record of execution and growth. We remain confident our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions as which was seen across the utility industry over the last 2 years. Despite this, the NiSource plan is stronger than ever. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in NiSource. And with that, I'd like to open the call to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from (inaudible) Capital.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', 'Appreciate all the disclosures today. So I guess just to start, the renewables investment and ownership upside that you kind of highlighted on slides here. Just how are you kind of thinking about the timing of layering that into the plan? And then I guess, Shawn, can you still sequence those cash flows from those projects to kind of do this without additional equity financing? Or just how are you kind of thinking about that?', 'Michael Luhrs', ""So this is Michael Luhrs. We're continuing to work through this in a disciplined and methodical way just as we have been all through the last year. Just maybe to walk through a little bit of history associated with it. So if you look at the Gibson and Fairbanks projects, which are part of the $1 billion upside when we look at a $2 billion upside when we look at the CapEx plan, we filed for in July a change for the Gibson from a PPA to a build transfer agreement that was received in November. We also, in 2023, filed for full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge. We received that in January of '24. During this period, we've been evaluating our analysis on Fairbanks and Gibson. And we expect to be able to work through those final details at an analysis now and give a more fulsome update in Q2. But we would plan to have that update and roll that through as we complete that analysis."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Then Nick, this is Shawn. To the second part of your question. I think the way we've described the future financing plan associated with the upside CapEx is that we would need to evaluate the cash flow profile of the projects. In this case, the 2 renewables projects that Michael has described and that you asked about, would have some assistance from PTC monetization over the plan horizon. It also would come with a higher depreciation rate relative to some of the alternative investments. Those have the ability to help the cash flow profile of the business. That said, construction time lines, regulatory recovery and obviously, the approval from the IURC would all play into the fact of how we would finance those projects, which is why we've described a potential modest increase associated with the ATM to maintain the capital structure when we access the upside CapEx plan."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just maybe sticking with financing, you're clear in slides that it's an ATM strategy for '24, but it does seem in the prepared remarks that you're open to doing something more kind of bilateral. Can you just kind of explain the thought there on where you stand?"", 'Shawn Anderson', ""We've studied our available trading days for the remainder of the year, and we're confident the equity need is highlighted. It's very executable under the ATM without (inaudible) placing any undue pressure on daily volumes. We've got strong sales agents set up to support the execution, and we'll be highly engaged in this on a daily basis to ensure successful execution and that our stock can realize the valuation uplift that we expect with our continued strong performance. That said, what we like about the ATM is it's very low cost. It has low friction costs and transaction fees associated with it. It also allows us to dollar cost average the access of equity to the timing by which that we would deploy the CapEx in line those cash flows up, which creates more efficiency throughout the year as opposed to a scenario where you might need to over finance or bring in more dollars than you need at any one point to deploy. So those are the things we like about the ATM. There are still ways inside the ATM to be able to wind those fundamentals up and we're open to those options if it makes sense. But bottom line, we need to be very, very efficient from a cost basis standpoint, and very, very much lined up with the timing of cash flows that we need to deploy to support our CapEx."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""So you -- obviously, you rebased hire again today, and you have the $2 billion of upside CapEx that you've identified, but obviously, that's not reflected in your plan. It's obviously the messaging is pretty straightforward, right? You guys have confidence in the 6% to 8% growth. Are you just -- are you comfortable guiding kind of where you are within the range you said.. The numbers seem to point closer to the top end, but as we're thinking about the incremental opportunities, I guess, where are you within the 6% to 8%?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""So Shar, we did a detailed assessment. We did raise guidance. We said in the past we're going to raise guidance. Our guidance for 2024 was based off of our strong performance in 2023. So if you think about the $1.60, $1.70 to $1.74 implies a 7.5% target for 2024. And we're very comfortable with those guidance ranges. So we're not necessarily guiding between the 6% to 8% at this point."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes. Just to reinforce that, Shar. It's a great question. When we see signs from the business that will lead us to a different outcome, we've built a track record to flow those updates through this call. We've done so at various points. So we won't wait to give you greater insight once we have a higher degree of confidence of exactly where we're going to land within the range if we need to send that signal. But right now 6% to 8% off of a strong 2023 year-end is the plan."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""That's helpful. And then just on the next -- just any status on the next NIPSCO case. Just trying to get a sense on how much renewable spending will likely be captured since the last case?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', 'Mel, do you want to talk about NIPSCO gas case?', 'Melody Birmingham', 'Hi, sure.', 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Are you talking about -- I'm sorry, Shar, NIPSCO, are you talking about the NIPSCO, current NIPSCO gas case or future electric?"", 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'The future electric.', 'Melody Birmingham', ""Well, we have not filed an electric case. So there isn't an electric case currently that has been shared. But we have, in fact, filed our gas case October of last year, and we are currently working with our intervenors as we're discussing what we see as a successful outcome through those negotiations. What we are expecting and working towards with those intervenors."", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""(inaudible) The way to think about the NIPSCO -- the way I think about the NIPSCO electricity, Shar, is what we like to do is follow that case pretty much in line with when we finish those renewable projects. And if you think about the last case, those renewable projects went in right before -- (inaudible) that case was executed. So I think we try to keep that gap really small. So that will be dependent upon finishing those renewable projects. And right now, they're on time, on schedule. We have more information about that, we'll follow the electrification. We'll let you guys know that as soon as possible."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Lloyd, yes, that was the [impetus] of the question. It's just how do we think about the timing of the next electric, I think you answered it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Shawn, just housekeeping for us. The $600 million, have you done any equity so far year-to-date? And then can you clarify you mentioned you might be doing some I think you said some product placements, some small product placements, if I heard that correctly. So what did you intend to say there?', 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes, absolutely, Durgesh. We have not executed anything under up to $600 million ATM program anticipated for 2024. In fact, we had an ATM equity program expire at the end of 2023. And we'll need to file a new ATM equity program to access the current guidance of up to $600 million, and we plan to do that very soon, which would give us the balance of the year for us to be able to execute that equity plan.We described a potential bilateral or discrete agreement inside the context of the ATM. It wouldn't be a private placement necessarily. However, some investors can solicit interest from sales agents directly and transact that greater than 1 share, for example, and that transaction would then be placed under the ATM and certainly, we would be interested if investors are interested at inefficient pricing."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""That's very helpful, Shawn. And you'll update us on the quarterly calls. As you execute on this program? Or how will we know over time, what portion of the $600 million you have executed?"", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes, that's exactly correct. We'll keep score along the way, and we'll certainly let folks know what we expect for the balance of the year and/or if any of the other aspects of the financing plan change that we'll be sure to update the slide that you see in the disclosure dock deck today."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'And then just one big picture question perhaps for Lloyd. CenterPoint announced gas LDC sales earlier, just thinking about the opportunities you have within your current portfolio. Are there opportunities to optimize assets to fund that growth? Or how are you thinking about that?', 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""So let me talk about it this way. I don't necessarily comment on any kind of specific M&A, but what I will say is when you think about NiSource, we are always very diligently reviewing -- diligently reviewing options to enhance shareholder value in our plan. But we're currently focused on our organic plan, invest in $16 billion at onetime rate base with another potential upside to investment of $2 billion.If you go back to 2022, we did a lot of work here in terms of our business review. And we see a couple of things that we like and that is the scale that NiSource has tremendous value. And we like the diversification of our 6 operating companies. You also saw us last year raise capital via, but you also raise capital via the NIPSCO transaction, what we thought was a very efficient process with respect -- very efficient tax process with respect to taxes. So with all that being said, what I'll say to you is we're always looking to enhance shareholder value. And if we find an opportunity to raise capital more efficiently to improve our enterprise value, we plan to take advantage of it. But right now, we're focused on our organic plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar.', 'Travis Miller', ""A question on this CapEx plan, I know it's difficult to parse out things here, but especially on the gas side, of that 5-year plan and whatever incremental part would be associated with the gas. How much would you attribute to base spending, safety spending core spending on the system? And then how much would you attribute to the new expansion opportunity you've talked about manufacturing and other new build opportunities on the industrial side."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Thanks, Travis, this is Shawn. I think that what we would attribute the planned CapEx for gas is almost all planned for safety, reliability and compliance work supporting our regulatory requirements from (inaudible) and from the local PUCs that we support. So as we think about the gas CapEx, that's the vast majority of the CapEx. We actually don't plan for significant amount of future expansion costs into the CapEx guidance itself because we often see that those CapEx amounts can be supported by incoming revenues to support the cost of basis itself. So as we have incremental projects like we had in Ohio for Intel to help support a larger economic development project, we'll work with local stakeholders, local mechanisms and move those into the capital plan as necessary. Some of those has signaled on the slides that Michael shared from the upside plan itself. But the way I would think about it is nearly all of the CapEx that we spend from a gas standpoint, absent a small amount is driven for safety, compliance, reliability upgrades across our system."", 'Travis Miller', 'And then a similar question. Of that, how much do you expect to flow through some of the mechanisms you have that are non base rate case related?', 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes, we do have mechanisms in different jurisdictions that enable recovery of whether you're calling economic development type projects. We have legislation that's supported in Ohio, have had for a number of years to support economic development expansion as well as in Indiana. But some of the forward-look test years such as that in Pennsylvania can enable us to project these types of projects. If we have line of sight to where economic development is going to come into place, and we can work through the regulatory mechanisms themselves or the rate cases themselves to ensure that we can get quick recovery or prompt recovery of those. So we haven't seen economic development to our business expansion be a drag on our earnings power across any of our businesses. In fact, that (inaudible) is one of the components that leads us to an upside within our range."", 'Operator', 'We have our next question from Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""I just had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Just I'm looking through your regulatory kind of outlook slides here, and I just wanted to know if you're still planning to file a rate case in Pennsylvania this year?"", 'Melody Birmingham', 'Nick, we did file a notice of intent for Pennsylvania. And so we are working through the details of when we file -- for this year.', 'Operator', ""We don't have any raised hands as of the moment. I'd now like to hand back over to the management for their final remarks."", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""So before I close, I want to take a minute here to thank Donald Brown. Donald is our EVP and Chief Innovation Officer, our former CFO, and after nearly a decade with NiSource, Donald informed us that he will be leaving the company to pursue other professional opportunities. I'll say we're extremely grateful to Donald for his service to NiSource and for helping us build a strong financial foundation and to help us evolve and execute our transformation strategy, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.I want to thank all of you for great questions and your support of NiSource and look forward to continuing to update you on future business activities. Thank you very much."", 'Operator', ""For attending today's call. We hope you have a wonderful day. Goodbye.""]"

I am particularly pleased with the inbound quality, as direct awards, iEPCI™ and Subsea Services exceeded 70% of Subsea orders.""', '""Total Company revenue for the year grew 17%, while adjusted EBITDA increased 40% to $939 million versus the prior year, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We generated cash flow from operations of $693 million and free cash flow of $468 million for the year, and we returned nearly $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.""', 'Pferdehirt continued, ""Any way you look at it, 2023 was a period of strong growth for our company. Our robust order intake drove a 50% increase in Subsea backlog to over $12 billion, with high quality inbound expected to support nearly 40% growth in Subsea adjusted EBITDA in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guidance.""', '""We started 2024 with the award of Mero 3 HISEP®, the first iEPCI™ project ever awarded by Petrobras, which exceeded $1 billion of inbound. The significance of this project for the subsea industry cannot be overstated, as it will be the first to use subsea processing to capture CO2 rich dense gases directly from the well stream for injection back into the reservoir. Importantly, this will all take place on the seafloor. The HISEP® project plays to our strengths, allowing us to demonstrate how technology innovation, project integration and partner collaboration enable our meaningful participation in the energy transition while remaining aligned with our strategic priorities.""', 'Pferdehirt added, ""We see continued strength ahead, driven by the resiliency and durability of this cycle. The demand for energy will continue to grow. However, we believe the market’s evolution will differ from the past, driven by three major trends. First, a shift in capital flows, which we believe will largely be directed to the offshore and Middle East markets. Second, an increased role for new technologies, as shown by the Mero 3 HISEP® award. And third, an expanded role for subsea services, driven by the needs of growing and aging infrastructure. These trends allow TechnipFMC to leverage our full suite of integrated solutions, differentiated technologies, and the industry’s most comprehensive subsea services offering.""', 'Pferdehirt concluded, ""We have entered an unprecedented time for the development of conventional energy resources, particularly offshore. This backdrop, combined with our unique capabilities, gives us the confidence to increase our expectations for Subsea inbound to reach $30 billion over the three-year period ending 2025. The significant increase in our order outlook will provide additional growth in backlog and further extend the execution of our project portfolio through the end of the decade.""', 'Operational and Financial Highlights', 'Subsea', 'Financial Highlights', 'Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Three Months Ended', 'Change', '(In millions)', 'Dec. 31,', '2023', 'Sep. 30,', '2023', 'Dec. 31,', '2022', 'Sequential', 'Year-over-Year', 'Revenue', '$1,720.5', '$1,708.3', '$1,342.5', '0.7%', '28.2%', 'Operating profit', '$145.7', '$177.7', '$61.5', '(18.0%)', '136.9%', 'Operating profit margin', '8.5%', '10.4%', '4.6%', '(190 bps)', '390 bps', 'Adjusted EBITDA', '$225.5', '$257.8', '$140.1', '(12.5%)', '61.0%', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', '13.1%', '15.1%', '10.4%', '(200 bps)', '270 bps', '\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Inbound orders', '$1,270.0', '$1,828.0', '$1,515.9', '(30.5%)', '(16.2%)', 'Ending backlog1,2,3', '$12,164.1', '$12,073.6', '$8,131.5', '0.7%', '49.6%', 'Estimated Consolidated Backlog Scheduling', '(In millions)', 'Dec. 31,', '2023', '2024', '$4,812', '2025', '$3,411', '2026 and beyond', '$3,941', 'Total', '$12,164', '1 Backlog as of December 31, 2023 was increased by a foreign exchange impact of $541 million.', '2 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for Subsea Services.', '3 Backlog as of December 31, 2023 does not include total Company non-consolidated backlog of $272 million.', 'Subsea reported fourth quarter revenue of $1,720.5 million, an increase of 0.7 percent from the third quarter.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for PPL ', 'We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, earnings were actually smaller than the dividend, and the company was actually spending more cash than it was making. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 92.0%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 50% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.', ""The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.47 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.03. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.5% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. PPL's EPS has fallen by approximately 17% per year during the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, while the dividend being raised can be good, there are some concerns about its long term sustainability. The company isn't making enough to be paying as much as it is, and the other factors don't look particularly promising either. Considering all of these factors, we wouldn't rely on this dividend if we wanted to live on the income."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

But this year, cocoa, sugar, and hazelnuts are really going up in a quite significant way. So it obliges us, again, to do price increases. We would prefer not to, but unfortunately, the inflation on the cost side for us is not stopping. What I would tell consumers is that it\'s an affordable indulgence or affordable luxury. It\'s time for yourself... It\'s something you can do on a day-to-day basis, and that\'s what we see from consumers.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Big food is trying to get back into the good graces of investors who have soured on the space as the Ozempic craze takes further hold. Not helping sentiment on the industry is that food inflation remains sticky, causing consumers to pull back on discretionary spending. Let's check in with one of the brighter spots from within the big food space, Oreo and Cadbury maker Mondelez. Here with us now is Mondelez Chairman and CEO Dirk Van de Put. Dirk, always nice to get some time with you."", 'So really, I think your presentation down at CAGNY was well received. Lots of focus on the top line. And that is a little bit also the vibe at the CAGNY conference. What are you doing to get your top line growth rate to the next level this year?', ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Brian. It's always a pleasure to be here. I would say that for us, continuous investment in our brands and not trying to drive the bottom line at any cost but always reinvesting half of the extra margin we grow every year into our brands has proven to be a very good recipe for us. So that's, for sure, something that we will continue to do going forward. We've done it in the last five years. It has worked well."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: The last time we-- the last time-- yeah.', 'DIRK VAN DE PUT: Go ahead.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Last time we talked, Dirk, you put a lot of emphasis, and I think it was Milka last year. A lot of emphasis on the Oreo brand and how big that brand has gotten in terms of importance for your company in terms of sales, in terms of profits. How do you unlock further growth in a big growth driver like that?', ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: Well, the two biggest markets for Oreo are the US and China. And there the brand has over 10% market share in the biscuits market. There is no other country in the world where Oreo has that type of a market share. But it's a yardstick. It's where we can get. So there is this geographical opportunity in all the other countries in the world to bring Oreo to the same level as the US and China. And then in the US in China, it's about keeping the brand active."", ""If I look at Oreo, the penetration per year is quite high in the US. But there is still opportunity. And it's only once a year. So we can increase what we call the frequency of consumption many, many more times than we have today. So even in the US in China, there's a huge opportunity for us by just getting consumers-- irregular consumers to be more regular consumers."", ""And then I would say, to keep the brand alive and to make sure that it really connects, we try to link it to the actuality of the moment anywhere in the world. So we were in the Super Bowl with our spot, there's big things coming in the second half. We've done Pac-Man, we've done Lady Gaga. So we keep the brand active. And that attracts consumers. They want to have the special edition related to that."", 'And we have a whole pipeline of things we can do with the brand. So keeping it top of mind of consumers. Driving the penetration and driving the frequency. I think the runway for Oreo is really big for the future.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: One of my interpretations, Dirk, from the presentation was that Mondelez is ramping up efforts to make a larger push at US convenience stores. What does that exactly look like, and how large is that sales opportunity?', ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: Oh. It's well over a billion dollars or more for us. As a company, we are very well represented in the grocery stores. That's our strength. Where we're not so well represented in convenience store. Yes, of course, you will find Oreo, you will find rates, you will find Clif Bar. But it's a bit fragmented. It's not the nice solid presence that you would expect. And so we have a real opportunity there. And so for us to get organized to really work on the route to market, our in-store presence represents a really big opportunity for us in the US."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Consumers have really-- and we saw a little bit of this yesterday in Walmart's earnings. Consumers appear to be pushing back on a lot of the price increases that were taken during the pandemic from a lot of food manufacturers. What do you just say to consumers that are tired of these price increases? And are you seeing costs come down for your business?"", ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: I'll start with the last part. Unfortunately, we don't. I know it has to happen at a certain stage. And what is annoying for us is that whatever the increases were two years ago and last year, those cost-- it was transportation or it was packaging or it was some of the oils we use, they're not increasing anymore. And some of it is coming down. But this year cocoa, sugar, and hazelnuts are really going up in a quite significant way."", ""So it obliges us, again, to do price increases. We would prefer not to. But unfortunately, the inflation on the cost side for us is not stopping. What I would tell consumers is that it's an affordable indulgence or affordable luxury. It's time for yourself, it's not a big spending, it's something you can do on a day to day basis. And that's what we see from consumers. We've had to increase our prices in the last two years quite significantly."", ""But we saw almost no elasticity. Consumers want their Oreo. They want their Ritz. They want their Clif Bar. And so I would say I hope that the consumers will stick with our brands, for another round of prices. It's not that big in the US because it's largely the chocolate brands-- Milka, Cadbury that are affected this year because of the cocoa prices."", ""So the price increases in biscuits are very limited. So I hope the consumer will understand that and be loyal to our brands, which so far they've done. So I feel pretty confident about that."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: What are your competitors in the chocolate category? Hershey, yesterday, talked about double digit price increases because to your point, cocoa prices have-- they've gone through the roof. Are you looking at similar increases?"", 'DIRK VAN DE PUT: Yes. Yes. We are not very represented in the chocolate market in the US. The US consumer will not necessarily see that in our brands. But in Europe, where we have Milka and Cadbury and so on, yes, we are looking at the same double-digit price increases in chocolate.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Under your leadership, Dirk, you really have repositioned or reinvented Mondelez-- a Clif Bar acquisition, a series of acquisitions. You have a really-- I think a lot of folks on the street commend you for the work you've done there and also improving your balance sheet, a lot of cash. Are you open to doing another deal this year? And what's your sense on the valuations on some snack brands?"", ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: Yes. We are open. M&A well-thought through. Financially disciplined M&A is part of our equation. It has worked well for us. I think we're good at it. But we won't do it at any cost or at any price. It's not like we have to-- we have very solid organic growth as a company. And we can make the company grow-- outgrow, I think, most of our competitors just in an organic way."", ""But M&A helps because it fills the gaps that we have around the world. What I'm seeing is there is certainly more interest in deals. Valuations are not coming down because there is more interest. The expectations of valuations are going up. But with a higher interest rates and the slower growth, it's much more difficult to get a return on your acquisition."", ""So we don't want to do crazy things. Like I said, we're disciplined. If it financially doesn't make sense to us, we won't make the deal. But there will be opportunities. And yes, we are working on potentially more deals this year. But I cannot tell you if they will come through, yes or no, at this stage."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Before we let you go, you teased some more big potential partnerships. Anything in the works with Taylor Swift. That's a standard question now, Dirk. We have to ask all companies, if they're working with her."", ""DIRK VAN DE PUT: I cannot say anything until it's signed. So I have to stay mute on the subject. But there is some very interesting stuff coming up on Oreo. I can tell you that."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: All right. Fair enough. Thank you for always making time for us. Dirk Van de Put-- Mondelez Chairman and CEO. We'll talk to you soon."", 'DIRK VAN DE PUT: Thank you.']"

The oil giant owns nearly half of the master limited partnership (MLP). A sale would enable it to quickly repay the debt it will incur by acquiring CrownRock.', ""Here's a look at why Occidental wants to cash in on its stake in the high-yielding MLP (it currently yields 7.5%) and which companies might be interested in the midstream specialist."", ""Occidental recently made a big splash, agreeing to acquire CrownRock in a $12 billion deal. It primarily plans to use debt to fund the transaction (it will issue $9.1 billion of new debt and assume CrownRock's existing $1.2 billion of debt). That deal structure is a major deviation from the acquisition blueprints of Chevron and Exxon, which are using stock to fund their megadeals. "", ""Occidental's use of debt to fund a major acquisition has burned it in the past. It outbid Chevron to acquire Anadarko in 2019 by offering a cash-heavy deal financed with debt and a preferred stock investment secured from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The oil producer had planned to quickly repay that debt by selling assets. However, it ran into regulatory issues and an oil-price slump, which impacted its ability to pay down debt as fast as it had hoped. "", ""That's leading Occidental to be more proactive this time. It's aiming to sell $4.5 billion to $6 billion in assets to repay the debt it will take on to acquire CrownRock. The company plans to repay at least $4.5 billion of debt within 12 months through cash flow and asset sales. "", ""Selling its 49% stake in Western Midstream (which it obtained when it bought Anadarko) would enable it to reach that target quickly. The midstream company currently has a $11.6 billion market cap. While Occidental would lose the cash flow from the MLP's distributions, it expects its CrownRock deal will boost its free cash flow by $1 billion within the first year, which will help offset that lost income. "", 'Western Midstream would make an appealing investment for other midstream companies and private equity funds. It operates a diversified midstream business with assets across several major producing regions:', ""Western Midstream has a premier position in the Delaware Basin. It's the only midstream specialist that provides oil, water, and gas services. It has the second-largest water gathering and disposal capacity and is the fifth-biggest gas processor. Western Midstream also has a large position in the DJ Basin, where it provides oil and gas infrastructure services. It's also the biggest gathering and processing (G&P) company in the Powder River Basin. "", ""The company's extensive midstream assets across those major production basins could make it an attractive acquisition target for another midstream business. Pipeline giants Williams, Energy Transfer, and Enterprise Products Partners have G&P operations in those regions, making them ideal strategic buyers. They could seek to acquire Occidental's stake as part of a larger takeover of the entire company. Meanwhile, private equity infrastructure funds are another potential buyer of Occidental's stake in the MLP. They could purchase it as a passive investment to generate income for their investors or as part of a larger acquisition of the whole midstream company. "", 'Occidental Petroleum is looking to sell its stake in Western Midstream to help fund its purchase of CrownRock. Its desire to divest that stake could ultimately lead to a merger with a bigger midstream company or a deal with a private equity fund. That makes it an interesting transaction process to watch. It could enable Occidental to quickly reach its balance sheet target while potentially allowing a larger midstream company to complete a needle-moving merger.

But Berkshire cut its Chevron stake every quarter between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023. All told, the position was reduced by exactly one-third in that time period."", 'The 2023 fourth-quarter purchase of 15.85 million Chevron shares breaks the selling trend. When Berkshire first entered Chevron, it looked more like a value play. And when it loaded up on Chevron in 2022, it resembled more of a trade than a true long-term investment. I think Buffett and his team are trying to find a balance of what allocation makes sense for Chevron in the long term.', ""Berkshire's purchase in the 2023 fourth quarter is a stamp of approval on Chevron's $53 billion merger with Hess, which was announced on Oct. 23. This is a big vote of confidence for Chevron investors and oil and gas investors in general because it shows that the Oracle of Omaha likely supports the wave of consolidation that is sweeping the oil and gas industry."", ""This idea is further supported by Berkshire's Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) stock moves. Between Feb. 1 and Feb. 5, Berkshire bought 4.3 million shares of Occidental Petroleum, a 1.8% increase. Oxy is now Berkshire's sixth-largest public equity holding and is valued at $14.2 billion. But Berkshire owns 28.3% of Oxy and 6.8% of Chevron, since Oxy is a far smaller company."", 'Oxy also announced a sizable acquisition in the fourth quarter with intentions to buy Permian Basin producer CrownRock.', ""Berkshire has been buying Occidental Petroleum stock consistently for a while now. So that move alone wouldn't have necessarily verified that Berkshire approves of oil and gas mergers and acquisitions. However, the decision to reverse the selling trend with Chevron by making a sizable purchase paired with more Oxy stock purchases is a clearer sign that Berkshire views the energy sector as an excellent value play and supports consolidation."", 'Outside of the usual repurchasing of Berkshire Hathaway stock, buying a boatload of Apple stock from 2016 and 2018 (and then selling some in 2020), and then the moves with Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, Berkshire has not made any other sizable changes to its public equity portfolio.', ""This tells me that Berkshire doesn't see better values out there than Apple -- which Buffett has praised as an elite business --\xa0and the energy sector, which remains a steep discount to the market. Oxy trades at a mere 12.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while Chevron trades at a 13.3 P/E. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 P/E ratio is 27.1."", 'Dealing with P/E ratios for oil and gas stocks is a bit tricky. If oil and gas prices crash, then earnings will plummet or could even be negative, as we saw in 2020. A better question is whether the business can improve and do well even at lower oil prices.', ""Chevron's blowout 2023 earnings proved that the company can do extremely well when Brent crude is around $80 per barrel. The company was able to use operating cash flow for a sizable capital expenditure program and record buybacks and dividends, including boosting its dividend by 8%. So that's what investors can expect from Chevron at $80 Brent crude. The merger with Hess will boost cash flow even further."", 'On its fourth-quarter earnings call, Chevron said it can cover its capital expenditures and dividend with Brent crude in the low $50 range. It would probably eliminate buybacks in that environment. But still, Chevron could fund a massive dividend program and invest in its long-term growth even if oil prices fell significantly.', 'The company reduced its outstanding share count by nearly 5% last year. Given the size of the Hess merger, Chevron will likely pull back on stock repurchases in the short term. But overall, it is incredibly committed to buybacks, which Berkshire loves.', ""Chevron's ability to invest in its long-term growth, grow its dividend, and buy back a ton of stock when oil prices are around their current levels are key parts of the energy company's investment thesis and is likely a big reason why Berkshire likes the stock."", ""Mirroring the trades of even the greatest investors isn't necessarily a good idea because their motives, position history, and structure are so different than an individual's. But tracking Berkshire Hathaway's moves could be useful to get a feel for Buffett and his team's opinions on the market."", ""The real insight won't come until May 4, when Berkshire holds its annual meeting. But for now, I think it gave investors a very clear sign that energy is the preferred sector for value, especially considering that the company trimmed its Apple position in the fourth quarter while adding to Chevron."", 'Barring a 30% or steeper decline in oil prices, Chevron will have a good year. If oil prices stay even remotely around where they are today, it will have an excellent year. If they rally, the company could have a near-record year.', 'Given its valuation, the risk/potential reward for Chevron stock makes a lot of sense right now.

The deal value surged 55% year over year to $425 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, signaling a robust revival in the sector.The revival is partly attributed to a stabilizing interest rate environment, which has enhanced valuation certainty, and a buoyant stock market, providing companies with additional resources for acquisitions. Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, the early momentum in 2024 surpassed expectations, with significant deals across various sectors, including technology, natural resources and financial services.The United States is at the forefront of this resurgence, with the biggest transaction being the acquisition of Discover Financial Services by Capital One Financial COF for $35 billion. The potential merger represents a significant consolidation within the financial sector, merging two of the nation's leading lenders and credit card issuers. This transaction is among the multiple billion-dollar deals that represent the early signs of a potential recovery in M&A activity (read: Capital One to Acquire Discover Financial: ETFs in Focus).Chip-design company Synopsys Inc.’s purchase of software developer Ansys Inc. for about $34 billion in cash and stock and Diamondback Energy Inc.’s (FANG) $26 billion deal to acquire fellow Permian Basin driller Endeavor Energy Resources LP are also among the big deals. In financial services, investment giant BlackRock Inc. (BLK) announced the purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. Other notable deals include Truist Financial Corp.'s (TFC) sale of its insurance brokerage business for $15.5 billion and Walmart’s (WMT) acquisition of Vizio Holding Corp. (VZIO) for approximately $2.3 billion."", 'Investors could easily take advantage of the surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company.\xa0This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted a few merger ETFs to capitalize on the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low-correlation strategy in their portfolio:\xa0IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA)\xa0IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 52 holdings in its basket and charges 77 bps in annual fees. IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF has amassed $307.5 million in its asset base and trades in an average volume of around 130,000 shares a day (read: What Lies Ahead of M&A ETFs in 2024?).AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF (ARB)AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF follows the Water Island Merger Arbitrage USD Hedged Index, which is designed to reflect a pure-play, global merger arbitrage strategy investing in definitive, publicly announced mergers and acquisitions. It holds 49 stocks in its basket and charges 76 bps in annual fees.AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF has accumulated $57.1 million in its asset base and trades in an average daily volume of 15,000 shares.First Trust Merger Arbitrage ETF (MARB)First Trust Merger Arbitrage ETF is an actively managed fund that establishes long and short positions in the equity securities of companies that are involved in a publicly announced significant corporate event, such as a merger or acquisition. It holds 25 stocks in its basket with AUM of $51.5 million.First Trust Merger Arbitrage ETF has an expense ratio of 1.80% and trades in an average daily volume of 21,000.ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR)\xa0ProShares Merger ETF provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. ProShares Merger ETF holds a well-diversified portfolio of 30 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fees. It has been able to manage assets worth $10 million while it sees a light volume of just 3,000 shares a day.', 'While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide a diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in a rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market.\xa0This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There’s plenty of room for growth ahead, just maybe not at the sky high rate investors have grown used to.', 'Too big to fail: For the time being, Nvidia is the “most sophisticated and deployed” chipmaker in the world, and its output is one of national importance, said Newman.', '“From a national security standpoint, [the US] needs to be the leader in AI,” said Newman. “The economic future of the world depends on AI, and we can’t let China have the most advanced chips.”', 'That’s the reason the US has invested $200 billion into the CHIPS and Science Act.', 'While there’s competition from companies like Intel and AMD, Nvidia remains the biggest game in town for now.', 'And because of its rapid growth, so many retirement savings accounts, institutions and life savings are heavily invested in the company’s success.', 'At the recent World Government Summit in Dubai, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even suggested that governments should consider instituting sovereign AI infrastructure.', 'That’s the idea that states should control the development of AI technology to best protect their national security, economy and culture as opposed to leaving corporations in charge.', 'TL;DR: “Nvidia is robust and will continue to grow,” said Newman. “But it needs to continue at a rate that’s eye watering or investors will start looking at other plays.”', 'What’s next: Wednesday is Nvidia’s big day, but Intel also has plans to share the spotlight.', 'OpenAI founder Sam Altman, who is reportedly working on his own chip-making venture, will join Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on stage at a company event. Investors will certainly be watching closely for any announcements.', 'What’s in your wallet? Capital One is making a $35 billion bet that the answer will soon be: more of its credit cards.', 'The bank announced Monday evening it is acquiring Discover Financial Services (DFS) in a $35.3 billion all-stock deal, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. If approved by regulators and shareholders, Capital One’s (COF) acquisition will create the biggest US credit card company by loan volume.', 'So what does that mean for you?', 'For now, not a lot. Given that the deal isn’t expected to be finalized until late 2024 or early 2025, Discover and Capital One customers shouldn’t anticipate any immediate changes.', 'And antitrust regulators could push that deadline even further out: The Biden administration has established a strong anti-merger stance by attempting to block consolidation of corporate giants, from tech companies to airlines.', 'But, down the road, there could be significant transformations.', 'For starters, all Capital One debit cards will be switched from Mastercard to the Discover network “within the first few years” from when the deal is finalized, Richard Fairbank, founder and CEO of Capital One, said in a Tuesday morning investor call.', 'Discover cards are already accepted at 99% of all US merchants that allow customers to make credit card purchases, according to the company. But Fairbank said people mistakenly believe that share is a lot lower.', 'Consumers could also end up paying higher interest rates.', 'Compared to other major credit card issuers, Capital One has historically catered to customers with credit scores in the 600s range, which is considered subprime. Given these borrowers are considered riskier, they tend to get charged higher interest rates compared to higher-scoring individuals.', 'Capital One is among 15 credit card issuers that have at least one card with a maximum interest rate above 30%, according to a recent report published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.', 'Walgreens Boots Alliance is getting the boot from the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and Amazon is taking its place, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya.', 'S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index, said in a statement Tuesday that the change is intended to reflect “the evolving nature of the American economy” by increasing the Dow’s consumer retail exposure.', 'The change means that investors who bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average will now have exposure to Amazon’s stock performance.', 'Amazon joins Apple and Microsoft as the third company from the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of high-performing tech stocks, to join the Dow 30. The other four companies in the group — Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, and Alphabet — are not included in the index, though all seven stocks are included in the much larger S&P 500 index.', 'Historically, getting added to or dropped from the Dow hasn’t had a significant impact on companies’ stock performances. But presence in the index, which began in 1896, comes with a certain level of cachet. The exclusive group traditionally tries to mirror the most important companies in the US economy.

Along with the wider board overhaul, the wealth advisory firm is also looking to replace chief operating officer Paul Duncan with Jamie Boychuk, a former executive vice president of operations at CSX.', 'Barber is also one of Ancora’s eight board nominees. The nominees include names like Sameh Fahmy, a former executive vice president at Class I railroad operator Kansas City Southern, and former Ohio governor and presidential candidate John Kasich.', 'The rail operator was in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2023, largely stemming from a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio last February. The derailment and subsequent handling garnered plenty of negative attention for Norfolk Southern, including scrutiny from President Joe Biden. The commander-in-chief visited East Palestine earlier this month for the first time and called the accident “an act of cruelty that was 100 percent preventable.”', 'But one year after the derailment, Ancora and its investor group appear to be just as concerned with Norfolk Southern’s lagging financial results behind Class I peers like CSX.', 'In a statement, the group said “Norfolk Southern’s status as the worst Class I railroad has been solidified” since the appointment of Shaw as CEO in May 2022, calling out the company out for “industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and a tone-deaf response” to the East Palestine incident.', 'Ancora called out Norfolk Southern’s poor operating ratio, which is a major driver in the profitability of a railroad company. The metric indicated that operating expenses represented 67.4 percent of overall revenue in 2023, far off the Class I average of 61.1 percent and further off the CSX average of 59.6 percent.', 'The activist investor criticized Norfolk Southern for being the only publicly traded rail company that does not use the precision scheduled railroading (PSR) system, a controversial strategy that involves consolidating rail networks through the use of point-to-point delivery tactics and consistent departure schedules.', 'PSR aims to reduce operating ratio to build longer, heavier trains, while eliminating shorter, less efficient lanes and excess staff—but is often cited by workers and customers as a major detriment to service quality. Norfolk Southern was set to implement PSR prior to Shaw’s tenure as CEO, but instead pivoted to a “resiliency model” that emphasized more resources and costs in down freight periods, with the objective of picking up extra market share from under-resourced trucks and rail competitors when market conditions get better.', 'Ancora and co. argue that the resiliency model is flawed, in that Norfolk Southern “is unable to handle current trough volumes” despite the excess resources in place. In fact, the investor group said the ratio of carloads to cars online is still 20 percent worse than CSX.', '“The bottom line is that it is time to actually move Norfolk Southern forward,” the investor group said. “Moving ahead starts with identifying the right destination.”', 'Norfolk Southern acknowledged Ancora’s nomination of the board candidates, but did not refer to the calls to replace Shaw or Duncan. The rail operator said the board’s governance and nominating committee evaluated and interviewed all the Ancora nominees.', 'In its defense of the board, Norfolk Southern highlighted that it cut its mainline accident rate 42 percent year-over-year in 2023, and is continuing to implement its six-point safety plan. The company also emphasized some of its positives, including 5 percent volume growth in its “most service-sensitive” intermodal business in the 2023 fourth quarter, as well as improvements in train velocity and dwell.', '“While there is more work to do to recover from the short-term impacts to margins, customers are seeing our progress,” Norfolk Southern asserted. “They recognize our commitment to delivering consistent, reliable service and are awarding us new business. We are now implementing the same Scheduled Railroading operating principles that improved velocity and resilience in our intermodal network across our merchandise network, which accounts for 2/3 of our train starts. As we do so, we will reduce variability, complexity and cost. That is our strategy in action.”', 'The activist investor group says it will release a second presentation in the coming weeks that will outline a 100-day transition plan and elaborate on more details of its turnaround strategy.']"

', ""For decades humans have been discovering ways to enhance their performance. Whether its academia, business, sports, or medicine, the use of both natural and synthetic substances is common to alter the chemistry of the human body. Natural substances such as coffee power up global workforces to an extent that America's biggest coffee chain, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), is worth a whopping $105 billion on the stock market. Similarly, anabolic steroids are some of the most watched out substances when it comes to high performance sports such as basketball, weight lifting, or football."", ""However, while most coffee requires milk and steroids require a prescription, another commonly consumed drink by truckers and college students alike is an energy drink. Energy drinks come in a variety of flavors and variants, and they can be stocked well in advance to allow 'binge' drinking for the really ambitious. Some common substances found in energy drinks are caffeine and taurine, with the latter often being exclusive to energy drinks or other carbonated beverages instead of being also found in, say, coffee."", 'Over the years, the global energy drink industry has also grown from being limited to a few players to seeing greater focus from big players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). With market capitalizations of $258 billion and $228 billion, they are among the biggest companies in the world that demonstrate that no matter how popular coffee is, at the end of the day a diversified business model can cater to tight consumer budgets during an economic contraction are still perceived to be worth more by both professional and retail investors.', ""Yet one of the most popular energy drink brands in the world, i.e. Red Bull, is private. Red Bull's advertisement campaigns have seen it associate its brand name with high risk activities such as the highest altitude parachute jump in the world and customized sports car racing, and when compared to its American counterpart Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), it can be safely assumed that Red Bull has a far greater brand reach."", 'Delving deeper into the current performance and environment of the energy drink industry, these companies tend to thrive the most when consumers have more money to spend. After all, while energy drinks are popular, they still are not essential daily use products such as toilet paper and toothpaste. However, they cannot be purely classified as cyclical either, especially since a lot of energy drink users consume them daily and might skip out on other purchases to keep up their consumption during tough economic times. As an example, consider research published in the BMC Public Health journal. It used data from 266 commercial bus drivers, a physically intensive job that can require hours of sustained concentration to safely operate a vehicle to show that 32% of the drivers drank seven to ten bottles of energy drinks a week - or more than one bottle a day. Additionally, three quarters believed that drinking energy drinks would improve their work performance, and the majority were unaware of any adverse health effects.', ""Shifting towards the corporate side of things, a brief look at the latest financial results of Monster Beverage and Celsius Holdings, Inc.

He’s known for drinking five cans of Coca-Cola each day, which he says makes up about 25% of his daily calorie intake, according to a 2015 Fortune interview.', 'Buffett’s investment strategy often involves buying into brands he enjoys, leading to stakes in See’s Candies, Dairy Queen, Apple and Coca-Cola, with his investment in the beverage giant at $23 billion in value. Buffett’s preference for Coca-Cola came later in life; for five decades, he was a dedicated Pepsi drinker.', 'The backstory of Buffett’s switch was detailed in the book “The Deals of Warren Buffett Volume 2: The Making of a Billionaire."" Don Keough, who lived across the street from Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, played a crucial role in this transition.', 'Back in 1960, Buffett approached Keough with a business proposition, asking for a $10,000 investment in his new partnership. Keough, hesitant because of Buffett’s non-traditional employment at the time, passed on the opportunity, later recounting to Michael Eisner, “I didn’t have it, but I could’ve borrowed it from my father. But can you imagine giving $10,000 to a guy who doesn’t get up and go to work in the morning?” This hesitance resulted in a missed chance to be part of what could have been a $93 million investment by 2018, according to the book.', 'After Coca-Cola acquired Keough’s company in 1964, his career flourished, eventually becoming president and COO.', 'In 1985, recognizing Buffett’s preference for Pepsi, particularly Pepsi-Cola Cherry, Keough took a pivotal step. He sent Buffett samples of Cherry Coke, enticingly referred to as the “nectar of the gods.” This act not only swayed Buffett’s soft drink allegiance but also cemented Cherry Coke as the official beverage of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings.', 'Just a year later, in 1986, Buffett declared: “After 48 years of allegiance to another soft drink, your chairman, in an unprecedented display of behavioral flexibility, has converted to the new Cherry Coke. Henceforth, it will be the official drink of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.”', 'Check out: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

Berkshire Hathaway now owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock, equal to around 8% of the company.', 'This story exemplifies how personal experiences and relationships can impact significant investment decisions. Buffett’s dietary habits and investment choices reveal a man who values personal satisfaction and financial wisdom, blending the two in a way that has contributed to his long-term success.', 'Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Waste Management (WM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Waste Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if WM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this garbage and recycling hauler holds up."", ""A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For WM, shares are up 6.71% over the past week while the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry is up 1.39% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.76% compares favorably with the industry's 2.33% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Waste Management have increased 18.92% over the past quarter, and have gained 32.29% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 9.79% and 23.69%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to WM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. WM is currently averaging 1,879,914 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with WM."", ""Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost WM's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.69 to $6.87 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that WM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A.

Legacy interpretations imply that ethics and profits go together like water and oil. After all, motor racing leagues penalize corner-cutting antics; otherwise, everybody would attempt to secure an advantage.', 'However, it may be a fallacy to assume that business ethics represent a barrier to profitability. To be fair, a short-term benefit may materialize from shirking morally upright practices. But in the long run, ESG stocks should outperform their less morally equipped counterparts. For one thing, it’s difficult to sustain customer loyalty if you’re constantly running afoul of basic principles.', 'On another level, it’s important for publicly traded enterprise especially to attract new investors. People are much more leery about investing in teams they don’t feel comfortable with. If a corporation earns a reputation for purely bottom-line thinking, prospective shareholders may think: could I be mistreated next? That’s why ethical stocks involve way more than just virtue signaling.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Finally, as a diverse cohort, Generation Z largely embraces ESG. Therefore, the below ESG stocks really just align with burgeoning realities.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR', 'Specializing in its namesake practice, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) isn’t just a landfill operator.

For one thing, the company owns a vast network of recycling facilities. Further, under its Recycle Right program, Waste Management provides educational materials in helping individuals accelerate the process effectively.', 'Second, the company forwards a waste-gas-to-energy project. Per its website, the natural decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces gas. By using a network of wells to collect this gas, Waste Management converts it into renewable energy. By substituting this unique energy source for fossil fuels, this process reduces greenhouse gases, thus benefiting the community and the environment.', 'Not surprisingly given the company’s permanent relevance, WM rates strongly for margins and consistent profitability. In addition, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a high-side target hitting $230. Therefore, it’s one of the top ethical stocks to consider.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Another entry for “E” under ESG stocks, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) presents a logical case for the conscientious investor. Per its website, NextEra is one of the nation’s largest capital investors in renewable infrastructure. Commanding a presence in 49 states, the company is working toward securing America’s independence. Through its vast network of facilities – including solar and wind turbines – NEE features about 72 gigawatts (GW) of operating capacity.', 'Through its investments, more of the country’s energy infrastructure stems from clean and renewable sources. Further, NEE makes a strong case for ethical stocks that are also profitable thanks to the burgeoning core industry. Per Straits Research, the global renewable energy market size reached a valuation of $1.09 trillion last year. By 2032, this figure could expand to $2.45 trillion.', 'To be fair, rough economic conditions hurt NEE bad in the final months of 2023. However, analysts anticipate a recovery, pegging shares a moderate buy with a $69.60 average price target. Thus, it’s one of the ethical stocks to target.', 'Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving onto the “S” component of ESG stocks, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers an intriguing opportunity. I don’t think it’s an anecdote to say that most Americans love the open-warehouse-style big-box retailer. For a nominal fee, you can get 800-pound jars of mayonnaise and a lifetime supply of pasta. Well, not really but you get the idea. But where it really shines is how well Costco treats its employees.', 'As the company states on its website, the success of the business depends on the well-being of its employees. Of course, I think every company says something like that about themselves. The difference with Costco is that countless independent assessments back up the claim. In 2022, data from Glassdoor noted that the retailer’s employees rated the business a four out of five regarding worker satisfaction, well ahead of direct competitors.', 'And while it’s not a blistering market performer, it’s a consistent winner. To no one’s shock, analysts rate COST stock a strong buy with a high-side target of $825. It’s easily one of the top ethical stocks.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'A brand that needs no introduction, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) helps fuel America – in a sense, quite literally. To get through the drudgery of the workday, millions of worker bees turn to caffeinated beverages. And with Starbucks located everywhere, it’s just too tempting to turn in for a quick (though expensive) pick-me-up.', 'Fundamentally, Starbucks also appeals to modern investors by emphasizing the “S” component of ESG stocks. In particular, the company proudly boasts of its ethical sourcing of its key ingredients, from coffee beans to tealeaves to cocoa. In addition, its manufactured goods – from the merchandise on its shelves to the furniture in its stores – involve ethical sourcing. Basically, the company talks the talk and walks the walk.', 'Also, I’d be remiss not to mention Starbucks’ youth empowerment, hunger relief, and inclusivity programs. The brand has been at the forefront of positive changes in society, making SBUX one of the top ethical stocks. And analysts love it, pegging shares a consensus strong buy.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational payment card services firm, Visa (NYSE:V) also needs no introduction. That’s mainly because there’s a good chance the card is in your wallet. According to a Forbes article in 2023, Visa represents the most carried card, printing a market share of 52.8%. So, it’s winning in the payment services department. It’s also waving the checkered flag in terms of ethical stocks.', 'Lots of folks love talking about the “E” and the “S” in ESG stocks. However, governance is also a major component of holistic ethics. Here, Visa’s corporate governance practices help promote long-term value and accountability to its shareholders. Part of this involves ensuring diversity and inclusion and not just in the workforce itself but in the upper echelons of leadership.', 'In this case, market forces help keep Visa honest. As a major blue chip, the company would get called out very quickly if it was ESG in name only. Lastly, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $303.74 average price target.', 'Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational technology company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, develops and sells consumer electronics, computer software and online services. Like some of the other ethical stocks on this list, Apple products – along with its connected ecosystem – have become ubiquitous. As a result, the tech firm leverages tremendous influence. Better yet, it’s wielding its power responsibly.', 'Maintaining high standards of governance, Apple focuses on a range of important issues. In June 2020, the company launched its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, advancing opportunities for many people of color and Indigenous communities. To be fair, the company needs work regarding ensuring more opportunities become available for leadership roles. Increased scrutiny and public pressure may help in this regard.', 'Also, Apple implements a shareholder voting process focused on executive compensation. That’s one distinct mechanism to keep the company accountable to stakeholders. Overall, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $208.07 average price target. Notably, the high-side target hits $250, implying robust bullishness despite a soft start to 2024.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'It wasn’t that long ago that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seemed a rudderless enterprise, just skating by on its legacy software suite. Those days are long gone. Thanks to the tech giant’s big investments in artificial intelligence, it has steadily rocketed higher since the 2022 doldrums. Further, as AI becomes more ingrained into everyday life, Microsoft stands to be a massive winner.', 'And when it comes to ethical stocks, the company may be the all-around champion. It’s really difficult to pin down MSFT stock as it belongs exclusively to one of the ESG components. For example, management set out ambitious environmental targets, most conspicuously being its aim to be carbon negative; that is, it will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.', 'In addition, it’s a huge player in social equity, promoting directives focused on encouraging women to participate in technology.

While there is nothing inherently wrong with the market showing such strength, there are a few concerning developments brewing that may lead to at least a minor correction in the coming weeks.', 'Because of these developments, I am turning my focus to some more defensive stocks which I will share here.', 'In the chart below we can see that the Nasdaq 100 has been trading almost perfectly up and to the right for the last three and a half months. But volatility has begun to pick up, and the index has now broken down below the lower bound of this upward trending channel.', 'These channel breakdowns can often be an early signal for more volatility, and so long as the market is below this level, I remain cautious. There is a similar setup in the S&P 500 as well.', 'Part of what powered the stock market rally over the last three months was the growing expectation that the Fed would be cutting interest rates early in 2024. But it seems we may be kicking the can down the road.', 'At the last CPI data release, we learned that inflation was hotter than expected, indicating that there may be some risk of cutting rates too early. Additionally, the employment data has also consistently shown that the labor market is extremely strong.', 'Because it appears that the economy is still in expansion, even with high interest rates, there is very little pressure on the central bank to rush and lower interest rates, and in fact there may be a risk of causing the economy to overheat if they do it too soon.', 'Just a month ago, futures markets were pricing in the first rate cut at the March meeting, and a second rate cut at the May meeting, but both of those are now off the table. This is already a big reversal in interest rate expectations and the ‘higher for longer’ narrative could be a catalyst for a further market selloff.', 'Last year we learned just how influential the seasonal trends of the market can be, as equities followed them almost perfectly all year. If you respect the market’s seasonality, you should be concerned about the next month.', 'The S&P 500 has just entered what is often the most volatile period of the year. Now through mid-March has the potential to bring some considerable selling.', 'A lot of the upside action in markets has been taking place in the high velocity, high growth technology and Artificial Intelligence adjacent stocks. Namely Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Nvidia (NVDA) have made truly stunning moves in just the last six weeks, with SMCI rallying as much as 280%, only to fall more than -30% in just the last week.', 'But there are other cracks forming in these leading sectors. Cloud and cyber security stocks have also been major contributors to the rally, and just this morning, one of the leading names got hit hard. Palo Alto, for instance, got hammered -30% this morning after cutting guidance.', 'The mean reversion occurring in these high momentum stocks has me looking for low-risk, secure, non-cyclical stocks to rotate into.', 'Now all these factors together don’t necessarily mean there is a stock market crash around the corner. The economy is strong, the Fed will be cutting rates later this year, and we are likely in a longer-term bull market that started last year.', 'However, even bull markets can have pullbacks of 5-10%, and for investors looking to get tactically defensive, now is a good time to initiate that plan.', 'One of the first places I like to look for defensive stocks is the healthcare sector. Medical stocks have non-cyclical characteristics, and regularly outperform the market during periods of elevated volatility. Even better if I can find ones that have a top Zacks Rank and are showing relative strength against the market.', 'The two healthcare stocks that I am looking at are HCA Healthcare and DaVita. Both stocks have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings and are industry leading names.', 'HCA Healthcare is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the US and enjoys a steady earnings revisions trend, and reasonable growth estimates in the coming years. Furthermore, the price action in the stock has been forming a convincing bullish pattern.', 'If HCA stock can breakout above the $310 level, it should send it to new highs.', 'DaVita, the country’s leading provider of dialysis care has a very similar setup to HCA Healthcare. In addition to a steady earnings revision trend, and strong EPS growth estimates, the DaVita has a reasonable valuation of 13.7x forward earnings.', 'It also has a clean technical trade setup like HCA. After gapping up following earnings, DaVita stock has been building out a bull flag. A move above the $123.50 level would signal a breakout, and likely draw in buyers.', 'And finally, the last defensive stock pick is General Motors. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, demonstrated by upward trending earnings revisions, the stock has a rock-bottom valuation. General Motors has a one year forward earnings multiple of just 4.3x. And with EPS growth estimates of 9% annually over the next 3-5 years, that gives GM a PEG Ratio of just 0.48x, indicating deep value based on the metric.', 'Like the others, General Motors stock also boasts a clean technical trading setup. Just today, GM stock broke out from a bull flag, and looks primed for a big move higher. What makes this strength even more impressive is that the stock is strong while the broad market is selling off today.', 'As is clear from the above write-up, there are at least a few developments in this market that are concerning. From interest rates to technical breakdowns, and we haven’t even mentioned the geopolitical tensions and approaching US presidential election, which only add to the uncertainty.', 'We also have to wait and see earnings from Nvidia today after the close, which is probably the most important earnings event of the season.', 'Nonetheless, even with all these bearish catalysts building there is always a bull market somewhere, you just have to dig.', 'Best of luck trading!', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

But volatility has begun to pick up, and the index has now broken down below the lower bound of this upward trending channel.', 'These channel breakdowns can often be an early signal for more volatility, and so long as the market is below this level, I remain cautious. There is a similar setup in the S&P 500 as well.', 'Image Source: TradingView', 'Rates and Inflation', 'Part of what powered the stock market rally over the last three months was the growing expectation that the Fed would be cutting interest rates early in 2024. But it seems we may be kicking the can down the road.', 'At the last CPI data release, we learned that inflation was hotter than expected, indicating that there may be some risk of cutting rates too early. Additionally, the employment data has also consistently shown that the labor market is extremely strong.', 'Because it appears that the economy is still in expansion, even with high interest rates, there is very little pressure on the central bank to rush and lower interest rates, and in fact there may be a risk of causing the economy to overheat if they do it too soon.', 'Just a month ago, futures markets were pricing in the first rate cut at the March meeting, and a second rate cut at the May meeting, but both of those are now off the table. This is already a big reversal in interest rate expectations and the ‘higher for longer’ narrative could be a catalyst for a further market selloff.', 'Image Source: CME Group', 'Seasonality', 'Last year we learned just how influential the seasonal trends of the market can be, as equities followed them almost perfectly all year. If you respect the market’s seasonality, you should be concerned about the next month.', 'As can be seen in the chart below, the S&P 500 has just entered what is often the most volatile period of the year.

In addition to a steady earnings revision trend, and strong EPS growth estimates, the DaVita has a reasonable valuation of 13.7x forward earnings.', 'It also has a clean technical trade setup like HCA. After gapping up following earnings, DaVita stock has been building out a bull flag.

In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, demonstrated by upward trending earnings revisions, the stock has a rock-bottom valuation. General Motors has a one year forward earnings multiple of just 4.3x. And with EPS growth estimates of 9% annually over the next 3-5 years, that gives GM a PEG Ratio of just 0.48x, indicating deep value based on the metric.', 'Like the others, General Motors stock also boasts a clean technical trading setup. Just today, GM stock broke out from a bull flag, and looks primed for a big move higher. What makes this strength even more impressive is that the stock is strong while the broad market is selling off today.', 'Image Source: TradingView', 'Bottom Line', 'As is clear from the above write-up, there are at least a few developments in this market that are concerning.

If you want to skip our overview of the different kinds of trading strategies and some latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""When it comes to trading, a strategy can typically follow two different directions. One of the more commonly understood trading strategies is trading by the fundamentals. This strategy looks at a firm's ability to make money, and it analyzes the income statement and the balance sheet to take stock of costs, assets, and other financial metrics that could hint at growth in the future and the corresponding share price appreciation."", 'The second direction or strategy is played by the technical indicators. As opposed to looking at fundamentals such as earnings per share or dividends, a technical trading approach instead analyzes share price trends and movements. It takes stock of a variety of factors such as the volume of shares traded, whether a stock is overbought or oversold if its share price is above or below long term averages, and the percentage of returns delivered by the price. By combining these factors, technical analysts believe that they capitalize on emerging market trends before they blow up and make a profit.', ""One kind of technical trading strategy is called momentum trading. For those out of the loop, analyzing a stock's momentum is unrelated to its balance sheet. Instead, it involves looking at the share price movements to see whether further upside or downside is present to merit an investment decision. Inside the momentum trader's toolkit are several 'tools' such as average directional indexes, moving averages, stochastic oscillators (also called a relative strength index (RSI)), and simple trend lines that gauge whether current share price levels are part of a broader upward or downward trend."", ""Together, these allow for informed decision making. For instance, let's consider a hypothetical stock A. A has an RSI reading of 19, a long term upward share price trend, and an ADX reading of 40. This might lead an investor to correctly conclude that since the RSI reading indicates that the stock is oversold, and the share price is trending upwards, then a high ASX reading could potentially present a chance for a profit since it indicates the presence of a trend. Of course, just as all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified investment professional, trying to read the technical tea leaves can yield better results if conclusions like the one in our example are also evaluated along with a fundamental reading. So if Stock A has high debt and falling revenue, then unless insiders or institutional investors know something that the broader market does not, it might not be worthwhile to wager holding A for a long time period."", ""With that out of the way, one way in which momentum stocks benefit is through the effects of macroeconomic news, events, and developments on the stock market. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the market has been held hostage by these events if we're being honest. Whether it's predictions of a recession, interest rate hikes, or high inflation, the market has seen investors flip between being bears and bulls depending on the nature of the data set. Right now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and the inflation readings for January 2024 that will help investors decide when the Fed might start cutting interest rates to ease business conditions and provide a further boost to the market."", 'Since the times are quite dynamic for the stock market, we decided to take a look at some top momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying.

Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.

The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment.

Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.

Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 3.85% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s quarterly revenues suggests a 17.09% year-over-year rise.

The acquisition of Uni-Select Inc. for $2.1 billion, completed on Aug 1, 2023, is expected to bolster its global automotive vehicle parts distribution business. The acquisition will solidify the company’s pre-existing business operations in Quebec, which is likely to have boosted the automotive replacement parts supplier’s result in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s North American and European segments have been performing well. The North American segment is likely to have achieved full-year EBITDA margins of more than 19% in 2023 (excluding the anticipated dilution of Uni-Select), which is likely to have buoyed LKQ’s margin in the to-be-reported quarter.In 2023, the average age of a new vehicle in the United States rose to 12.5 years, up from 12.2 years in 2022. Ageing vehicles have higher demand for spare and replacement parts.

If you want to skip our primer on short squeezing, and some of the greatest short squeezes in history, then you can take a look at the\xa05 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""Short selling is one of the most controversial aspects of the stock market. After all, investing is typically thought to be a 'value creating' endeavor, where both retail and professional players engage in trading to pick the right stock and make millions if not billions of dollars."", 'On the flip side, short selling comes with the aim of profiting from the drop in share price. Those who argue in its favor belief that it allows market players to exploit weaknesses and be rewarded for their actions. A rather controversial practice short sellers benefit when the shares of a firm, such as the well known U.S. green vehicle designer Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) or the Indian business conglomerate Adani Enterprises Limited (NSE:ADANIENT.NS), drop in value. Yet, this same drop harms existing investors as well, an occurrence that ensures that short selling will remain controversial as long as the stock markets continue to exist.', ""While the profits of short selling stocks are lucrative, at the same time, betting against the wrong names can be disastrous and wipe out entire portfolios. While short sellers who target Nikola and Adani ended up being richer, the stock market is also filled with examples of stocks that ended up being short squeeze stocks. One source of controversy surrounding short selling surrounds the fact that bets against a stock are publicly visible. So, you can see what the short interest in a stock that trades on the NASDAQ exchange is simply by visiting the exchange's website. As a result, at least when it comes to the retail front, if a stock has a substantial amount of short interest, then investors looking to pick it as a long term, value creating investment will naturally wonder if there's something under the hood that's amiss."", ""Similarly, and particularly as events after the coronavirus pandemic have shown, short squeeze stocks can also change the fortunes of those lucky or wise enough to pick them. The pandemic, which saw populations all over the world sent indoors, also led to the two biggest short squeezes in history, the meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC). GameStop's short squeeze dented Wall Street in ways previously unimaginable, and it even led to Senate hearings of Reddit forum members."", ""However, when it comes to the all time legendary short squeeze stocks, while GameStop is well known, there are tons of others that have made even larger impacts. For instance, even as of 2021, when Insider Monkey took a look at 10 Biggest Short Squeezes of All Time, the biggest short squeeze after 13 years was Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY). The Volkswagen short squeeze cost short sellers more than three times in losses than GameStop, fueled by the fact that as Volkwagen's shares soared, it became the most valuable company in the world with a share price of €999."", ""The saga of Volkswagen's legendary short squeeze is more complex than the tale written by the GameStop traders. At its heart was the hedge fund industry, which sought to exploit the price differential between the firm's preferred and ordinary stock in the aftermath of legal developments in Germany that enabled a Volkswagen takeover through holding a 75% interest in the firm. Preferred stock, for those out of the loop, is a dividend paying security that does not offer its holder a stake in a publicly traded company's governance."", ""When the difference in the prices between the two share classes started to grow, investors sold 12% of the ordinary shares short. But, they were caught with their pants down after Porsche revealed that it had quietly bought nearly 75% of Volkswagen's stock. This meant that as Porsche and a German State owned nearly 94% of the shares, half of those who had shorted the stock would be left without the ability to close their bets. Consequently, the mad scupper to buy Volkswagen shares ensured that Volkswagen became the world's most valuable company.

Shares of homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) rise after topping fiscal first-quarter earnings estimates on Tuesday. What is Toll Brothers' guidance forecasting for US housing market hopes?"", 'John Lovallo, UBS US Homebuilders & Building Products Equity Research Analyst, explains patterns in housing demand and how homebuilders are managing to maintain resiliency amid mortgage rate and inventory pressures.', '""It\'s been a tale of two markets. The new home market has been very good, and we can talk about that. It\'s the existing home market, because there\'s no supply of inventory on the ground, which has been much more sort of locked in place, if you will,"" Lovallo tells Yahoo Finance.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""BRAD SMITH: Toll Brothers showing positive early signs for this year's housing market, raising its guidance after home deliveries rose 6% from a year ago. This comes after mortgage rates ticked up last week, according to data from Freddie Mac, hitting the highest level in two months."", ""For more on the state of homebuilders, we're joined by John Lovallo, who is the UBS US homebuilders and building products equity research analyst there. Woo. John, thanks so much for taking the time here today. First and foremost, I mean, let's just dive into these earnings from Toll Brothers because if we're trying to get a read on the rebound efforts that we're trying to see within the housing economy, what is the read through that we get from Toll Brothers here? On the super-luxury side, I might add."", 'JOHN LOVALLO: Sure. Hey, Brad. Thanks for having me.', ""I think the read through is much broader than just the super luxury. Toll's done a very good job of mixing their portfolio down to basically cover most price points across the spectrum."", 'I think the read is very positive. Order growth was up 40% year over year. Gross margin was well ahead of expectations by 90 basis points, and EPS beat meaningfully. And on top of that, they took their outlook up for deliveries, margins, EPS, and EPS actually went up by 10%.', ""And so what does this tell us? I think it says that demand for housing remains resilient, right? And I think Seana at the onset had mentioned, you know, Is the worst over for this market? And, you know, look, I think it's been a tale of two markets. The new-home market has been very good, and we can talk about that. It's the existing-home market, because there's no supply of inventory on the ground, which has been much more sort of locked in place, if you will."", ""SEANA SMITH: Right, John. That's great to point out, and I totally agree with you. When we talk about, though, I think one of the things, obviously-- and I know you've covered it extensively-- has just been the inability or lack thereof to meet that strong demand, right? People who own homes right now, many of them locked in to 4%, 5% below mortgage rates. They're simply not moving. Because of that, we have this massive disconnect between inventory and what we're seeing demandwise. Are home builders-- I guess do you see them at all closing that gap this year, and what does the incentive picture look like as they're trying to draw more people off the sidelines and be able to purchase their homes?"", ""JOHN LOVALLO: Yeah, it's a great question. Look, I think I would tell you at the onset that we would prefer lower rates any day over higher rates. It's better for the market. It's better for the stocks. However, what I would tell you is that in this sort of high 6%, low 7% mortgage range, it's sort of Goldilocks for the home builders because they have the ability to buy down mortgage rates and offer this financing that can allow folks to get into homes. And you couple that with the fact that people who own homes today, as you mentioned, Seana, are not moving. They're kind of locked into place. And so the demand that is out there-- and it is resilient-- is all being funneled toward this new-construction market, and the public builders are gaining a tremendous amount share though. So for the public builders that we cover, it's a pretty good environment."", ""BRAD SMITH: How well are the homebuilders doing, from what you've monitored, at attracting those first time-home buyers, especially the millennial cohort?"", ""JOHN LOVALLO: Doing incredibly well, Brad. I mean, look, this was a big concern for a number of years that this generation was different. They didn't want to buy homes. They didn't want to own big-ticket items. Look, I think that as life goes on and life events like marriage and child rearing occur, we're finding that this generation is very similar to prior generations, and they want to own a home. And the public buildings--"", ""BRAD SMITH: Of course we want to own a home, John. My goodness. Are you kidding me? I don't know. It must have been the Great Financial Crisis or just the wild inflation around student tuition. I don't know. Just throwing things out there."", 'JOHN LOVALLO: Yeah. Yeah. So the builders have done a very good job of getting out there, building smaller footprints, more affordable price points, maybe a little further away from city centers but making the math work for this buyer.', 'SEANA SMITH: John, when it comes to those incentives-- circling back to what you just said a minute ago. I think the question out there is, How long are these homebuilders going to leave some of those incentives in place? If you were to be or if one of these homebuilders were to be the first to remove an incentive, how big of a hit they could potentially see as a result of that. How do you see the whole incentive game playing out here over the next couple of years?', ""JOHN LOVALLO: I think it's important to keep in mind that homebuilders are underwriting or penciling these deals to a return, right? And so the toggle point is sort of gross margin. And so what they'll do is they'll go into the market, kind of gauge demand. If demand is good, they can raise prices, to some extent. If it's not, they will offer these incentives."", ""I think as we move into the spring selling season, at least here in the early days, there's going to be a reluctance to pull back on incentives because they want to get their footing in this all-important spring selling season."", 'Now as we progress over the next month or two, if that demand remains resilient-- and by the way, Toll said that January and February were a better-than-normal seasonality for them-- in fact, very, very strong months. If that continues, I think you will see the opportunity for builders to pull back on the incentives, and that will be accretive to margins and, frankly, to returns at the end of the day.', ""BRAD SMITH: John, who's your top pick among the homebuilders going into the spring selling season?"", ""JOHN LOVALLO: You know, our top pick is still DR Horton. That's ticker DHI. We think that, you know, they're the largest by volume by a margin of 15%. There's a lot of advantages to size and scale, both locally and nationally. And they attract the right part of the market, in our opinion, which is that first-time, entry-level buyer, which is really driving the demand in today's homebuilding market."", ""SEANA SMITH: John Lovallo, always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for joining us here on the results from Toll Brothers, also what we're seeing play out more broadly within the homebuilding space. John, thanks so much."", 'JOHN LOVALLO: My pleasure. Thank you.']"

This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying."", ' View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', ""The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, prior to this announcement, Sherwin-Williams' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 38.1%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 22% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.667, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.86. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Sherwin-Williams has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time."", 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows.

And over the past year, the stock is now down around 6%. This has been a fairly safe stock to own amid inflation, because the soft drink and snack company has been able to pass along rising costs to consumers. ', ""However, there is now some cause for concern given more challenging conditions that could be on the horizon for the business. Let's see what might be best for investors to do now."", ""PepsiCo isn't normally a fast-growing stock. But over the past few years, it has generally had no problem generating year-over-year growth. In its most recent quarterly results, however, that changed. For the last three months of 2023, PepsiCo's net revenue declined by 0.5% to $27.9 billion. The company's expansion rate hasn't been in this bad shape since the early stages of the pandemic."", 'PEP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts', ""Consumers have typically continued to buy PepsiCo's products even as the company has increased prices. After all, at just a few dollars, they still aren't terribly expensive items to buy. But over time, those price hikes add up, and consumers do eventually reach a breaking point."", ""What was perhaps more concerning about PepsiCo's recent earnings report was that volumes were down across the board. In each one of the company's segments, demand had declined versus the same period last year. Organic volume fell 4% overall, which offset the effects of price increases. Exacerbating those problems was a recall related to the company's Quaker brand granola bars and cereals due to possible salmonella contamination."", ""Another possible problem for investors to worry about is retailers fighting back against the price hikes. Carrefour, a major French multinational retailer, recently stopped carrying PepsiCo's products, saying that its price hikes have become excessive. While it may be a negotiating tactic with PepsiCo, it could have an impact on its pricing strategy and possible demand for its products."", ""France accounts for a fairly modest 1% of PepsiCo's top line, but given the overall picture of volumes declining in multiple markets, it could be a sign of greater pushback from not just consumers, but retailers as well."", ""For PepsiCo, which normally doesn't generate much significant revenue growth, even small headwinds could collectively make a noticeable impact on the company's top and bottom lines. For now, it's too early to tell if the spat with Carrefour will prove to be material or not, but it could nonetheless lead to a tough path ahead for PepsiCo as it goes up against some stronger numbers from last year."", ""Currently, PepsiCo's stock trades at 25 times trailing earnings.

Investors have been paying a bit of a premium for the shares in recent years given strong consumer spending, but if PepsiCo's growth rate struggles to stay in positive territory, even maintaining this valuation could prove to be a challenge."", ""PepsiCo has some strong brands in its portfolio and it could be a good long-term investment, especially when you consider it pays a dividend that yields 3%.

PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), the company behind both brands, is every bit as iconic as Coca-Cola, one of its biggest rivals. If you're a long-term investor with a growth and income approach, you might want to consider adding the salty-snack giant (and second-place soda maker) to your portfolio. Here's why."", ""Right up front, it's important to recognize that a company with a $220 billion market cap isn't likely to be an exciting company to own. It's well beyond the size at which it can grow its business rapidly, so growth investors will probably want to look elsewhere. But that doesn't mean PepsiCo is a bad company, just a mature one. It's the type of company you buy when it's reasonably priced, or cheap, and hold it for decades."", ""The biggest highlight of the company's long-term success probably shows up in its dividend record. The company is a highly elite Dividend King, with over five decades of annual dividend increases behind it. That's a streak you simply can't build by accident. It takes consistently strong execution in good economies and bad. The average annualized dividend increase over the past decade, meanwhile, was around 8%. That's a solid number, well above the historical growth rate of inflation, but not massive. In other words, slow and steady is basically what investors have been rewarded with over time."", ""Now, one caveat here is that the dividend yield is 3%. While that's higher than what you could get from an S&P 500 Index fund, it isn't likely to get dividend-focused investors all that excited. In all, PepsiCo looks like an attractive growth and income stock, but those looking to maximize either of those two extremes -- growth or income -- will probably be let down."", ""If you own PepsiCo already, you might be a bit worried by the stock price action. The shares have fallen roughly 15% from their 52-week highs. Don't lose any sleep, though. Recent financial performance has been fairly strong even in the face of rising inflation. For example, organic revenue growth was a lofty 9.5% in 2023. That was helped along by price increases, of course, but that's what consumer-staples companies do when trying to offset rising costs. It's worth noting that volumes were a little weak, but that's what happens when consumer-staples companies raise prices. Eventually, consumers get used to the higher prices."", ""This pullback really isn't a good reason to sell the stock if you're a long-term growth and income investor, though it might be a good reason to buy some more shares."", ""If you don't own PepsiCo yet, meanwhile, you might want to jump in. The dividend yield has been higher in the past, but the price pullback has pushed the yield toward the high side of the historical yield range. That hints that the stock has been put on the sale rack. A screaming buy? Perhaps not, but it does seem fairly priced to a little cheap right now."", ""That stance is buttressed by more traditional valuation measures such as the price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book value ratios. All three are at or below five-year averages. Not shockingly below by any means, with P/E actually in line with the longer-term average. But taken together with the dividend yield, it appears that investors would be paying a fair price or cheaper. That's not a bad outcome when you're looking at a Dividend King that's operating fairly well in a tough environment."", ""PepsiCo isn't so cheap that investors should back up a truck and load up on it. But the stocks of well-run companies rarely get that cheap. If you're looking for a reliable growth and income stock, PepsiCo looks like an attractive choice today. You could try to wait for a cheaper entry point, but that might mean you miss the opportunity to buy a great company at what appears to be a pretty fair price."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PepsiCo wasn’t one of them.

Whether its academia, business, sports, or medicine, the use of both natural and synthetic substances is common to alter the chemistry of the human body. Natural substances such as coffee power up global workforces to an extent that America's biggest coffee chain, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), is worth a whopping $105 billion on the stock market. Similarly, anabolic steroids are some of the most watched out substances when it comes to high performance sports such as basketball, weight lifting, or football."", ""However, while most coffee requires milk and steroids require a prescription, another commonly consumed drink by truckers and college students alike is an energy drink. Energy drinks come in a variety of flavors and variants, and they can be stocked well in advance to allow 'binge' drinking for the really ambitious. Some common substances found in energy drinks are caffeine and taurine, with the latter often being exclusive to energy drinks or other carbonated beverages instead of being also found in, say, coffee."", 'Over the years, the global energy drink industry has also grown from being limited to a few players to seeing greater focus from big players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc.

After all, while energy drinks are popular, they still are not essential daily use products such as toilet paper and toothpaste. However, they cannot be purely classified as cyclical either, especially since a lot of energy drink users consume them daily and might skip out on other purchases to keep up their consumption during tough economic times. As an example, consider research published in the BMC Public Health journal. It used data from 266 commercial bus drivers, a physically intensive job that can require hours of sustained concentration to safely operate a vehicle to show that 32% of the drivers drank seven to ten bottles of energy drinks a week - or more than one bottle a day.

There are all kinds of businesses in the equity markets that seem intriguing. However, upon closer inspection, many of these corporations don't actually prove worthy of investors' time or money."", ""On the other hand, some companies look almost too attractive to pass up, given their underlying businesses' strength and growth prospects. Let's look at two examples in the biotech industry: Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN)."", ""Novo Nordisk is the company behind the now-famous drug Ozempic, whose active ingredient is semaglutide. In the weight-loss market, it's marketed as Wegovy. These two brand names helped catapult Novo Nordisk's sales higher last year. The company's revenue for 2023 came in at 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.6 billion), 31% higher than the previous fiscal year. Wegovy's sales skyrocketed by 407%, while Ozempic's jumped by a much less impressive, though still admirable, 60% year over year."", ""Novo Nordisk's position in its core therapeutic areas of diabetes and obesity care is what makes it such a strong buy. As of November, it had a 33.8% share of the global diabetes market, up from 31.9% a year before. It also held a 54.8% share of the market for GLP-1 drugs (therapies like Wegovy that help patients control hunger and appetite, and aid in weight loss), although that declined slightly by 0.1% compared to November 2022."", ""Still, Novo Nordisk will benefit from the projected growth in these fields. It estimates that the global obesity market experienced volume growth of 116% in 2023. Analysts say this momentum will last for years, and few companies are better equipped to profit from it than Novo Nordisk. The company's existing lineup is solid, it boasts several more exciting pipeline candidates, and it has a long track record of delivering important regulatory wins in this area."", ""The last factor can hardly be overstated, especially as many other drugmakers want to challenge Novo Nordisk. Pfizer is one of them, but a recent phase 2 data readout for one of its obesity drug candidates was pretty disappointing, so Pfizer didn't advance it to late-stage clinical trials. No company will have a 100% record in developing medicines, but few have been more successful at doing so in diabetes and obesity care than Novo Nordisk. The only other company that compares is Eli Lilly."", 'Meanwhile, Ozempic should earn significant label expansions, and Novo Nordisk will launch other brand-new products in this area and others. The drugmaker is making a conscientious effort to diversify its lineup. Novo Nordisk crushed the market last year, and it should have many more years ahead of delivering outsized returns.', 'Last year was an important one for Regeneron. The company achieved meaningful clinical and regulatory progress. On the clinical front, it reported positive results in a phase 3 clinical trial for Dupixent, one of its main growth drivers, in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).', ""Regeneron shares the rights to Dupixent with Sanofi. The two partners are racing toward a label expansion which, according to some analysts, could add as much as $3.5 billion in global sales of Dupixent. The medicine's peak annual revenue could hit $20 billion by the end of the decade -- few products in the industry have achieved this feat. And for reference, Dupixent reported total worldwide sales of $11.6 billion last year, 33% higher than in 2022."", ""Elsewhere, Regeneron earned approval for a high-dose formulation of its other main growth driver, Eylea, which treats wet age-related macular degeneration. This new formulation will help extend the medicine's patent protection while attracting patients who want fewer doses per year."", ""Last year, Regeneron's revenue increased by just 8% year over year to $13.1 billion. However, the biotech's declining coronavirus portfolio had a bit of a negative impact on its results. Aside from that, Regeneron's top line grew by 12% compared to 2022."", ""The company should have an even stronger performance this year thanks to brand-new potential approvals such as cancer medicines odronextamab and linvoseltamab, both of which are under investigation by regulators. Regeneron's ability to develop new therapies is well-established, and the biotech has an exciting pipeline that will continue to produce new gems. In the meantime, Dupixent and Eylea will keep driving revenue and earnings higher."", ""In recent years, Regeneron has also delivered excellent stock-market performance.

That recovery suggested its could exceed its long-term goal of growing its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%-7% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2025."", ""Unfortunately, Cisco's growth decelerated over the past two quarters -- and its revenue and EPS declined in the second quarter of fiscal 2024."", 'Metric', 'Q2 2023', 'Q3 2023', 'Q4 2023', 'Q1 2024', 'Q2 2024', 'Revenue growth (YOY)', '7%', '14%', '16%', '8%', '(6%)', 'Adjusted EPS growth (YOY)', '5%', '15%', '37%', '29%', '(1%)', 'Data source: Cisco. YOY = year over year.', ""Cisco claims that slowdown was caused by its customers placing too many orders after its supply chain constraints initially eased in fiscal 2023. After receiving those shipments, its customers deployed their equipment at a slower-than-expected rate as the macro headwinds forced them to rein in their spending on big networking upgrades. As a result, the market's demand for new networking devices abruptly dropped off a cliff."", ""But that pressure won't ease up anytime soon. Cisco expects its revenue to decline another 16%-17% year over year in the third quarter and drop 8%-10% for the full year. But looking ahead, its planned acquisition of Splunk -- which will expand its smaller observability software business (1% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2024) -- might offset some of those headwinds when it closes the deal in the first half of fiscal 2025."", ""Analysts expect Cisco's revenue to rise 2% to $53 billion in fiscal 2025, but that would mark a CAGR of less than 2% from fiscal 2021 and broadly miss its long-term goal for 5%-7% growth."", ""Cisco's revenue growth has stalled out, but its adjusted gross and operating margins still expanded year over year in the first half of fiscal 2024."", 'Metric', 'Q2 2023', 'Q3 2023', 'Q4 2023', 'Q1 2024', 'Q2 2024', 'Adjusted gross margin', '63.9%', '65.2%', '65.9%', '67.1%', '66.7%', 'Adjusted operating margin', '32.5%', '33.9%', '35.4%', '36.6%', '33%', 'Data source: Cisco.', 'Lower freight costs, component costs, and a favorable product mix boosted its gross margins and offset the pricing pressure from its delayed deployments.

That competitive pressure could throttle Cisco's growth, compress its margins, and drive it to make more acquisitions to widen its moat."", ""Therefore, investors shouldn't expect Cisco to simply bounce back from its recent downturn after its customers finally deploy their existing orders. But even if the bulls don't rush back, its low valuation and high yield could limit its downside potential."", ""I wouldn't ever call Cisco a value trap because its core business is stable, its dividends are easily sustainable with a low payout ratio of 47%, and it will remain firmly profitable for the foreseeable future. Instead, I think it's still a decent value stock for investors who want a safe place to park their cash while generating stable dividends."", ""That said, Cisco's investors need to temper their near-term expectations.
